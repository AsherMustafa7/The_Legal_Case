Ph. Saliwan vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
elder brother, Md. Rizwan, was subjected to preventive W.P. (Crl.) No. 24 of 2022
Page 1 detention in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit
Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.
[2] Heard Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government
Advocate, appearing for respondents No. 1 & 2; and Mr. S. Vijayanand Sharma, learned Sr. PCCG,
appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] The main ground urged by Mr. H. Kenajit, learned counsel, is
that there is unexplained delay on the part of the State authorities in disposing of the representation
made by the petitioner's brother against his detention. Be it noted that the detenu's representation
was dated 10.10.2022 and the same was rejected by the State Government on 31.10.2022.
[4] The affidavit-in-opposition filed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur,
reflects that the representation dated 10.10.2022 was received by the authorities of the Home
Department on 12.10.2022. Para-wise comments were called for from the police department upon
the said representation and the same were received on 24.10.2022 leading to rejection of the
representation on 31.10.2022. The affidavit-in-opposition, however, offered no explanation for the
time lags in dealing with the said representation. [5] The file of the detaining authority, produced by
Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government Advocate, reflects that the Inspector General of Prisons,
Manipur, forwarded copies of the detenu's representation dated 10.10.2022 to the Special Secretary
(Home) Government of Manipur, on 12.10.2022 and they were received on the very same day. The
Superintendent of Police, Thoubal District, furnished para-wise comments on the said
representation under his letter dated 21.10.2022, which was received by the State Home
Department on 24.10.2022.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 24 of 2022 Page 2 The para-wise comments were furnished in response to the letter
dated 19.10.2022 addressed by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, to the
Director General of Police, Manipur, requesting that para-wise comments may be furnished on the
representation on or before 21.10.2022. The letter also sounded the caution that representations are
required to be considered and disposed of by the Government immediately to avoid legal
complications. However, no explanation is forthcoming either from the affidavit-in-opposition or
from the original file as to why para-wise comments were not even solicited till 19.10.2022 when the
detenu's representation was received on 12.10.2022 itself. Even in the Note-file, there is no evidence
of consideration of the said representation at any level within the Home Department between the
dates 12.10.2022 and 19.10.2022. It is well settled that procedural safeguards provided under the
Constitution and preventive detention laws must be scrupulously adhered to. Delay in disposal of
the representation made by a detenu against his detention order would be violative of the rights
guaranteed to such detenu.
[6] In Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the Supreme Court observed that
if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's representation owing to indifference or any other
lapse, such delay would adversely affect further detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme
Court, it is for the authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation
and it is not enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer delay can as well be explained
and so, the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is explained by the authority

concerned. Be it noted that the unexplained delay in that case was a mere 5 days.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 24 of 2022 Page 3
[7] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of
Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of detention on the
ground that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of an order on the representation
made by the detenu. [8] More recently, in Sarabjeet Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate,
Jabalpur, and others [(Criminal Appeal No. 1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC Online
SC 1019], the Supreme Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State
Government denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the
delay by the State Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the heart of the
procedural rights and guarantees granted to a detenu. [9] Though it is laudable that the Government
of Manipur is waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit
drug manufacture, trafficking and marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its
responsibility to ensure that the procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the
Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention laws. Despite
this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by the authorities concerned to
compliance with the prescribed norms.
[10] The unexplained somnolence on the part of the State authorities in dealing with the detenu's
representation dated 10.10.2022 clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual approach on their part,
which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a matter of this nature. The same would
also be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order.
W.P. (Crl.) No. 24 of 2022 Page 4
[11] The order of detention dated 20.09.2022 issued by the Special
Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings
based thereon shall also stand set aside. The detenu, Md. Rizwan, presently incarcerated in Manipur
Central Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly
required in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 24 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for information
and necessary further action in the context of educating the detaining authorities in the State of
Manipur as to what are the procedural norms that they need to adhere to while exercising power
under preventive detention laws.
