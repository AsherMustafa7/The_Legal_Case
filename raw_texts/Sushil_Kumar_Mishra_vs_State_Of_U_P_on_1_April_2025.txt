4. This is a second bail application. The first bail application of the applicant was rejected vide order
dated 30.10.2023 passed by this Court passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.22489 of 2023.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant has been falsely implicated in the
present case. It is argued that earlier the applicant Sushil Kumar Mishra was granted anticipatory
bail by a coordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 27.5.2022 passed in Criminal Misc.
Anticipatory Bail Application No.3340 of 2022 (Sushil Kumar Mishra Vs. State of U.P. and another)
against which the first informant Vivekanand Mishra preferred an appeal before the Apex Court
numbered as Criminal Appeal No.1096 of 2022 (Vivekanand Mishra Vs. State of U.P. and another)
which was allowed by a judgement and order dated 29.7.2022 and the impugned judgement therein
was set-aside. The Apex Court in its judgement and order in para nos.8 and 9 has considered the
said C.C.T.V. Footage and has held that the accused-respondent or his mother did not give any
explanation as to how the C.C.T.V. Footage was obtained or how the C.C.T.V. Footage was
transferred to Pen Drive. In continuation of the same it is submitted that the said C.C.T.V. Footage
contained certificate under Section 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act and the Forensic Science Lab
gave its report that the same is not tampered. The copies of the said documents have been placed
before the Court as Annexure No.35 to the affidavit filed in support of bail application. It is further
argued that the matter was taken up for further investigation and the first informant has been made
as an accused in the same and report has been submitted by the investigating agency which is also
before the trial court concerned. It is submitted that the same are new facts which may be
considered. The applicant is in jail since 6.4.2023.
6. Per contra learned counsel for the first informant opposed the prayer for bail and argued that
there is dying-declaration in the matter. It is submitted that the anticipatory bail application of the
applicant although was allowed by this Court but the Apex Court set-aside the said order by means
of a detailed judgement. It is submitted that the first bail of the applicant was rejected by this Court
on 30.10.2023 and the said dying-declaration was handed over on 3.10.2023 which was prior to the
rejection of the first bail application and as such is not a new fact at all. It is further submitted that
the matter was taken up for further investigation on the basis of a letter dated 13.6.2023 of a
Member of Parliament who was totally unconnected with the matter and the investigation in the
matter concluded. It is submitted that previously the investigation in the matter had concluded and
a charge sheet dated 16.6.2022 was submitted on which the court concerned had taken cognizance
on 1.7.2022 after which the letter of the said Member of Parliament was sent which was sent after
about 11 months of taking cognizance upon the said charge sheet. The cognizance as taken by the
court concerned is a valid cognizance. There is no fresh and new ground in the present bail
application. The same be dismissed.
7. Learned counsel for the State also opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that the first bail
application of the applicant has been rejected by this Court by a detailed order on 30.10.2023. It is
submitted that there is dying-declaration implicating the applicant in which active role of
participation has been given to the applicant. Further there is no fresh and new ground in the bail
application and the arguments of learned counsel for the first informant are adopted.

8. After hearing the counsel for the parties and perusing the record, it is evident that this is a second
bail application. The first bail application of the applicant was rejected by this Court vide order
dated 30.10.2023, the said order reads as under:-
"1. Shri Gaurav Kumar Shukla, learned counsel for the applicant, Shri Anirudh
Kumar Upadhyay, learned counsel for the first informant and Shri Devendra Nath
Mishra, learned counsel for the State are present.
2. This bail application under Section 439 of Code of Criminal Procedure has been
filed by the applicant- Sushil Kumar Mishra seeking enlargement on bail during trial
in connection with Case Crime No. 100 of 2022, under Sections 147, 148, 149, 352,
323, 306, 504 and 506 I.P.C., Police Station Kotwali, District Basti.
3. The first information report of the matter was lodged on 11.02.2022 by Vivekanand
Mishra against the applicant and six other persons alleging therein that his
neighbour Vijay Nath Mishra had dispute with him with regards to property,
regarding which a suit which is pending. On 11.02.2022, due to construction of a
balcony which was being done by Vijay Nath Mishra, he went to the place and told
him to stop it on which they tried to enter into maar-peet and after which Vijay Nath
Mishra and the other accused persons including applicant at about 11.00 a.m. started
abusing and armed with lathi, sariya, knife and hammer assaulted him due to which,
he received lot of injuries. Krishnavati, wife of Vijay Nath Mishra and Reeta Mishra
his daughter were exhorting, on seeing him receiving injuries, his sister Kanya
Kumari came shouting to save him on which the accused persons assaulted her and
set her on fire. The persons of nearby and neighbours on hearing shout, reached the
place of occurrence to intervene. His sister was taken to the District Hospital from
where looking to her condition, she was referred to the Medical College where she is
being treated.
4. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that general role has been assigned to the
applicant and six other co-accused persons of assault upon the first informant and
also upon the sister Kanya Kumari and of setting her on fire. It is argued that a dying
declaration is alleged to have been recorded of the deceased Kanya Kumari on
12.02.2022 in which she has given general role to all the accused persons including
the applicant of pouring oil on her and setting her on fire. It is argued that there is a
CCTV footage of the place of occurrence which shows that after the fight between the
parties, the deceased Kanya Kumari set herself on fire and sustained burn injuries. It
is argued that the said CCTV footage was sent to the Forensic Science Lab which was
examined and a report was sent stating of its genuinity. It is further argued that
co-accused Prabhat Kumar Mishra has been granted bail by a co-ordinate Bench of
this Court vide order dated 24.01.2023 passed in Criminal Bail Application no. 18564
of 2022, Prabhat Kumar Mishra vs. State of U.P., co-accused Pawan Mishra has been

Sushil Kumar Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 1 April, 2025
bail vide order dated 24.01.2023 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 24035
of 2022, Virendra Mishra vs. State of U.P., co-accused Vijay Nath Mishra has been
granted bail vide order dated 17.02.2023 passed in Criminal Misc Bail Application
No. 7564 of 2023, Vijay Nath Mishra vs. State of U.P. The copies of the said orders
have been placed before the Court which are annexure no. 12 to the affidavit in
support of the bail application. It is argued that as such, the bail application be
allowed.
5. The applicant is having no criminal history as stated in paragraph no. 26 of the
affidavit in support of the bail application and is in jail since 06.04.2023. It is further
argued that the first information report was initially lodged under Sections 147, 148,
149, 352, 323, 326, 504 IPC, but during investigation, Section 326 IPC was deleted
and Section 306 IPC was added in it.
6. Learned counsel for the applicant argued that there is no abetment and instigation
of any kind by the applicant which has any nexus with the death of the deceased, the
applicant has no mens-rea at all, there is no overt act whatsoever of the applicant,
which resulted in the death of the deceased, the applicant has no motive at all to
commit the aforesaid offence.
7. Per contra, learned Counsel for the State and learned counsel for the first
informant vehemently opposed the prayer for bail. It is argued that initially the
applicant was granted anticipatory bail vide order dated 27.05.2022 passed in
Criminal Misc. Anticipatory Bail Application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. No. 3340 of
2022 against which the informant filed a SLP (Criminal) No. 6166 of 2022 which was
allowed by the Apex Court vide order dated 29.07.2022 and the order of the High
Court was set aside. It is argued that then the applicant did not surrender, but
absconded for nine months and it was only when coercive measures were taken
against him, he surrendered on 06.04.2023. It is further argued by learned counsel
for the first informant that anticipatory bail of co-accused Virendra Mishra was
rejected by this Court vide order dated 29.04.2022 passed in Criminal Misc.
Anticipatory Bail Application No. 3224 of 2022, Virendra Mishra vs. State of U.P. and
anr. The copy of the order has been produced before the Court which is taken on
record. It is argued that Subhadra Kumari, the mother of the deceased has supported
the prosecution case which gets corroboration from the dying declaration of the
deceased in which the applicant and the other accused persons are stated to have
poured kerosene on her daughter and set her on fire. It is argued that the deceased
received 86% burn on front of her body. The doctor where she was taken in an
injured condition, opined the object of causing injury is kerosene oil, as its smell was
present. It is argued that the applicant did not even consider and respect the order of
the Apex Court inasmuch after the SLP of the informant was allowed and the order
granting anticipatory bail of the applicant was set aside, he absconded for nine
months and it was only after coercive measures were issued against him, he
surrendered. It is further argued that paragraph nos. 12 and 13 of the affidavit in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/147927237/ 4
Sushil Kumar Mishra vs State Of U.P. on 1 April, 2025
support of the bail application states in specific terms that the applicant Sushil
Kumar Mishra lodged FIR as against Case Crime No. 396 of 2021, Police Station
Kotwali, District Basti, but the said fact is incorrect fact inasmuch as the copy of the
first information report which is annexed as annexure no. 8 to the bail application
would go to show that the said FIR was lodged by Vijay Nath Mishra and not by
Sushil Kumar Mishra, the applicant. It is further argued that identically in paragraph
no. 13, it is stated that the applicant Sushil Kumar Mishra lodged FIR as Case Crime
No. 491 of 2021, Police Station Kotwali, District Basti which is also incorrect as a
reading of the said FIR which is annexed as annexure no. 9 to the affidavit would go
to show that the same was also lodged by Vijay Nath Mishra and not by the applicant.
It is argued that the abscondence of the applicant, nature of evidence, the statement
of Subhadra Kumari and medical evidence, the applicant is involved in the present
case and the case is of the applicant along with co-accused persons pouring kerosene
on the deceased and setting her on fire. The bail application be thus, rejected.
8. After having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records, it is
evident that the applicant is named in the FIR. He is also named in the dying
declaration of the deceased along with other co-accused persons. The role assigned is
of pouring kerosene on the deceased with other co-accused persons and setting her
on fire. The applicant was granted anticipatory bail by a co-ordinate Bench of this
Court. The said order was challenged before the Apex Court wherein the said order
was set aside. After the same, the applicant absconded for nine months and it was
only after coercive measures issued against him he surrendered. There is no
explanation for the abscondence of nine months of the applicant after the order of the
Apex Court, this shows his highest disregard for courts of law. Insofar as co-accused
persons are concerned, although, they have been granted bail by co-ordinate benches
of this Court, but the orders cannot be binding on this Court. Parity may be one of the
considerations while considering the bail application, but cannot be the sole and only
criteria for decision of the bail application.
9. Looking to the facts of the case, the medical evidence, conduct of the applicant and
the nature of the case, this Court does not find it a fit case for bail, hence, the bail
application is rejected."
9. The report of the Forensic Science Lab states that the CCTV Footage is not tampered and the fact
that the matter was investigated further and the first informant has been made as an accused are
subject matter of trial. The trial court has taken cognizance on the charge sheet dated 16.6.2022 on
1.7.2022. The same is a valid cognizance and any material coming subsequent to it is for the trial
court to consider as per law. No fresh and new ground for bail is made out.
10. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, I do not find it a fit case for bail, hence, the
bail application is rejected.
