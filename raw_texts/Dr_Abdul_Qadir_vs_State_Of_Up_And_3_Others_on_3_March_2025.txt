Dr Abdul Qadir vs State Of Up And 3 Others on 3 March, 2025
"1. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned AGA for State respondents.
2. Present writ petition has been preferred for quashing the FIR dated 10.1.2023
being Case Crime No.12 of 2023 under Sections 376, 506 IPC and Section 67A of
Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 P.S. Pakbara, Distt. Moradabad
and for a direction to respondents not to arrest the petitioner pursuant to impugned
FIR.
3. This much is contended that the petitioner is practicing doctor and the informant
was pursuing Nursing Training Course at the relevant point of time. No case is made
out under Section 376 IPC as both were living in relationship for quite some time and
enjoyed good relation till September, 2022 and thereafter the relation between them
became sour, which culminated into lodging of FIR in the year 2023. However, the
matter was amicably settled between the parties vide joint affidavit dated 3.10.2023,
which is appended as Annexure No.7 to the writ petition. It is submitted that since
the parties have already settled the matter out of court and as such, the impugned
first information report is liable to be quashed. In support of his submission, he has
placed reliance on the judgements of Hon'ble Apex Court in B.S. Joshi Vs. State of
Haryana reported in 2003(4) SCC 675, Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of
investigation and another J.T. 2008(9) SC 192, Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2012)
10 SCC 303, Yogendra Yadav and others Vs. State of Jharkhand (2014) 9 SCC 653
and also in Narendra Singh Vs. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466.
4. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioners that all the disputes and
differences have been settled between the parties. At this stage, it is pressed that
continuation of the proceedings of the aforesaid case will be an abuse of process of
law. He submits that the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed in view of the law laid
down by the Apex Court in Gian Singh (supra), B.S. Joshi (supra) and Madan Mohan
Abbot vs. State of Punjab, (2008) 4 SCC 582.
5. Learned AGA, on the other hand, on the basis of instructions, states that
chargesheet in the present matter has already been forwarded to the competent court
on 8.10.2023 and as such no interference is required in the matter.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the impugned FIR had been lodged
on 10.1.2023, the settlement between the parties took place on 3.10.2023 and
chargesheet had been forwarded to the competent court on 8.10.2023. On the
instructions, he states that till date the chargesheet has not reached to the competent
court. The said factual aspect of the matter may be verified by the Investigating
Officer. He further submits that even if chargesheet has been forwarded to the
competent court, the writ petition can be heard on merits vide judgement and order
dated 29.01.2024 passed by Hon'ble the Apex Court in Criminal Appeal arising from
SLP (Crl.) No(s).7273/2019 (Mamta Shailesh Chandra vs. State of Uttarakhand.

7. We have considered the rival submissions and gone through the entire record.
8. In all the aforesaid cases, the Apex Court has laid down the law that criminal
proceedings may be quashed even in non-compoundable cases by the High Court in
exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction to restore peace between the parties and in
case the justice so demands. According to Hon'ble Supreme Court, if the offence
involves private dispute between the parties of commercial nature or matrimonial
dispute and it is not related to heinous offence, the proceedings may be quashed.
9. Since the dispute between the parties has been amicably and mutually settled, no
fruitful purpose would be served by permitting to continue the criminal proceeding
and it would simply be a waste of time, if the aforesaid case is permitted to continue
till its logical conclusion.
10. As it is informed that till date the police report under Section 173 (2) of Cr.P.C.
has not been accepted in the aforesaid Case Crime, we direct that the parties may
appear before the Investigating Officer for verification of the settlement/compromise
dated 3.10.2023 on 15.3.2024. Thereafter, the investigating officer will produce the
parties to the concerned jurisdictional Magistrate for verification of the said claim. It
is also directed that the Magistrate concerned will record the statement of the parties
concerned as to whether the terms and conditions if set out in the
settlement/compromise had been fulfilled or not and submit a report before this
Court by the next date. List this matter on 29.3.2024.
11. Till the next date of listing, the petitioner shall not be arrested pursuant to
impugned FIR, provided he cooperates with the investigation in question."
4. In response to the order dated 11.3.2024, a report dated 27.3.2024 is submitted by the Chief
Judicial Magistrate, Moradabad whereby the compromise/settlement has been duly verified.
Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the parties reached a mutual compromise and
executed a Compromise on 22.03.2024, agreeing to withdraw cases filed against each other. He
further states that since the parties have already settled the matter, the instant First Information
Report is liable to be quashed.
5. Confronted with the above situation, learned A.G.A. submits that he is having no objection in case
the impugned first information report is quashed as the matter is already settled between the parties
and the interim order was also accorded in favour of the petitioners by order dated 11.3.2024.
6. It is jointly submitted that this being an offshoot of a dispute, same has come to be amicably
resolved under the compromise dated 22.03.2024, duly verified by the concerned Judicial
Magistrate, pending proceedings would serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in
the light of the judgements of the Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of
Haryana and others, 2003(4) SCC 675 and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab, 2012(10) SCC 303.
Reliance has also been placed on the judgment of Division Bench of this Court dated 16.9.2022 in

Dr Abdul Qadir vs State Of Up And 3 Others on 3 March, 2025
Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No.8510 of 2022 (Anuj Pandey v. State of U.P. & Ors.), wherein, it is
observed that the High Court has ample power under its inherent jurisdiction to quash the first
information report in which the parties have settled their disputes which are of private in nature and
have no any grave impact on the society. The time of courts as well as investigating agencies are very
precious which should not be wasted in any futile proceedings where the chance of conviction is
bleak.
7. Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh (supra) has held in para-61 that;
"the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint
in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to
a criminal court for compounding the offences Under Section 320 of the Code.
Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be
exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure the
ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what cases
power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R may be exercised
where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts
and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before
exercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature and
gravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences
like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or
victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not
private in nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise
between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under special statutes like
Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants while
working in that capacity etc; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly
and pre-dominatingly civil favour stand on different footing for the purposes of
quashing, particularly the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile,
civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony
relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basically private or
personal in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category
of cases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the
compromise between the offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote
and bleak and continuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by not quashing the
criminal case despite full and complete settlement and compromise with the victim.
In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of
the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite
settlement and compromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to
secure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if
the answer to the above question(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well
within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."

8. The genesis of the dispute between the parties was love affair. Neither it is involving any moral
turpitude nor is heinous in nature. Since the dispute between the parties have already been settled
amicably vide compromise dated 22.03.2024 and the same was also duly verified by the concerned
Chief Judicial Magistrate, therefore, under the changed circumstances, pending proceedings would
serve no purpose and the same are liable to be quashed in the light of the aforesaid judgments.
9. The writ petition is allowed and the proceedings of First Information Report dated 10.1.2023
being Case Crime No.12 of 2023 under Sections 376, 506 IPC and Section 67A of Information
Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 P.S. Pakbara, Distt. Moradabad are quashed.
