[Golmei Gaiphulshillu Kabui, J]
[1] Heard Mr. RK. Milan, learned counsel appearing for the

(i) To admit the appeal.
(ii) To call for the record.
(iii) To set aside the judgment and decree dated
25.09.2024 passed in Mat. (Declaration) Suit No. 6
of 2024 of the Ld. Family Court, Manipur.
(iv) To pass decree declaring that the
plaintiff/appellant is the unmarried daughter of (L)

[3] Brief facts of the case are that the appellant is the last
daughter born on 01.04.1979 out of the wedlock of her father namely,
Chabungbam Babudhon Singh. Her father was serving as Chowkidar in
the Education Department, Government of Manipur posted at the office
of the Principal, Government Hindi Teacher Training College, Imphal. He
retired from service on superannuation on 31.09.2002 and died on
10.05.2015 while enjoying his pension. After his death, her mother
namely, Ch. Thambal Devi enjoyed the family pension of her father.

However, after the death of her mother on 12.11.2023 leaving behind
the respondents including herself, since she is unmarried and
unemployed daughter, she approached the concerned authority to get
the family pension on 08.01.2024, as having no means for her
livelihood. As advised by the authority, she filed a Matrimonial
(Declaratory) Suit No. 6 of 2024 before the Ld. Family Court Manipur
with the following prayer:
(i) To pass a decree declaring that the
plaintiff/appellant is the unmarried daughter of
Chabungbam Babudhon Sigh and Chabungbam
Thambal Devi.
(ii) To pass any other orders as this Hon'ble Court
deems fit and proper for end of justice.
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 3
The respondents have also filed their written statement
having no objection to the claim of the appellant/plaintiff as the facts
are all correct and true.
[4] In this regard, the plaintiff/appellant produced three
witnesses including herself and it is the finding of the Ld. Trial Court
that the plaintiff/appellant is the unmarried daughter of the deceased.
However, vide order dated 25.09.2024 which is impugned
herein, the Ld. Family Court dismissed the Matrimonial (Declaration)
Suit of the plaintiff/appellant and the operative portions of the said
order are extracted herein below:
"9. The present application has been filed to enjoy the
benefits of family pension which has been extended to
unmarried/widowed/divorced daughter, not covered by
category-I of Para No. 8.4 of the O.M. dated 05.05.2010,
upto the date of marriage/re-marriage or till the date she
starts earning or upto the date of death, whichever is
earlier of the Government Servants who retired or expired
as a pensioner or died/die, while in service as the case

may be, on or after 01.01.2006 as per Notification No.
114 dated 21.05.2011 published in the Manipur Gazette
(Extra Ordinary). However, at para No. 4 of her pleadings,
she stated that her father retired on 31.09.2002 and this
fact of corroborated by Ext. A/3 which shows the date of
retirement as '31.03.2002' and therefore she is not
entitled to family pension as per Notification No. 114
dated 21-05-2011 published in the MANIPUR GAZETTE
(Extraordinary).
10. Hence the plaintiff has no cause of action for filing the
present suit.
Reliefs:
11. As the plaintiff has no cause of action for filing the
present suit, she is not entitled to any reliefs claimed.
12. Suit is dismissed.
13. Prepare a decree."
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 4
[5] Mr. RK. Milan, learned counsel appearing for the appellant
submits that even if the office memorandum is an issue in the Ld. Trial
Court, the Ld. Trial Court failed to interpret the office memorandum. It
has been admitted fact as well as reflected in the impugned judgment
and decree that the father of the appellant retired on superannuation
on 31.09.2002 and died on 10.05.2015. Since the Ld. Trial Court failed
to interpret the words "expired as a pensioner", the present matrimonial
appeal has been filed. The aforementioned office memorandum is
extracted herein below:

Subject: Grant of family pension to the

[6] Since the judgment and decree was passed on 25.09.2004, certified copy of the same was applied
on 27.07.2024 and delivered to the appellant on 19.10.2024, the present appeal is within time.
In view of the facts and circumstances and being aggrieved by the said impugned judgment and
decree, the instant case has been filed on the following grounds:
(i) The Trial Court while passing the impugned judgment and decree failed to
interpret the office memorandum.
(ii) The Ld. Trial Court failed to appreciate the fact that the office memorandum has
never been an issue in the matrimonial (declaration) suit.
(iii) The Ld. Trial Court had greatly error in coming to the conclusion that the father
of the appellant retired on 31.09.2002 and therefore, his daughter is not entitled to
family pension as the Ld. Trial Court failed to interpret the meaning of the words
"expired as a Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 8 pensioner" as he died on 10.05.2015
much after 01.01.2006 which qualified the appellant for family pension.
(iv) The Ld. Trial Court failed to appreciate that under what condition, the appellant has filed the
declaratory suit for declaration of an unmarried daughter as having no means, living hand to mouth
and also by delaying justice to the appellant will have serious effect.
[7] On perusal of the pleadings of the appellant/plaintiff, the relief/prayer sought for in her
application was just to declare the plaintiff/appellant as unmarried daughter of Chabungbam
Babudhon Singh and Chabungbam Thambal Devi. But, on perusal of the dismissal order of the Ld.
Family Court, Manipur, the Ld. Family Court, Manipur dismissed the application of the
plaintiff/appellant on the following grounds:
"9. The present application has been filed to enjoy the benefits of family pension
which has been extended to unmarried/widowed/divorced daughter, not covered by
category-I of Para No. 8.4 of the O.M. dated 05.05.2010, upto the date of

marriage/re-marriage or till the date she starts earning or upto the date of death,
whichever is earlier of the Government Servants who retired or expired as a
pensioner or died/die, while in service as the case may be, on or after 01.01.2006 as
per Notification No. 114 dated 21.05.2011 published in the Manipur Gazette (Extra
Ordinary). However, at para No. 4 of her pleadings, she stated that her father retired
on 31.09.2002 and this fact of corroborated by Ext. A/3 which shows the date of
retirement as '31.03.2002' and therefore she is not entitled to family pension as per
Notification No. 114 dated 21-05-2011 published in the MANIPUR GAZETTE
(Extraordinary).
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 9
10. Hence the plaintiff has no cause of action for filing the present suit.
Reliefs:
11. As the plaintiff has no cause of action for filing the present suit, she is not entitled
to any reliefs claimed.
12. Suit is dismissed.
13. Prepare a decree."
It is to clarify that the date of the Office Memorandum as mentioned in the said judgment and
decree should be 17.05.2011 not 21.05.2011.
[8] On careful perusal of the said Office Memorandum dated 17.05.2011, the Ld. Trial Court wrongly
quoted that the petitioner is not entitled to family pension. But, it is to clarify that the contents of
the said memorandum show that the plaintiff/appellant is entitled to the family pension. Because
the last part of the memorandum clearly mentioned that -
"...................... Government servants who retired or expired as a pensioner or
died/die while in service as the case may be on or after 01.01.2006."
It is admitted position of fact that the father of plaintiff/appellant retired in the year 2002 and
expired in the year 2015.
However, we are not inclined to give any finding in this regard as this is not an issue at hand.
In the facts and circumstances and observation made above, we are of the view that the core issue
for discussion in the instant case is as to whether the Trial Court can grant relief which are not
sought for in the pleading.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136633029/ 8
Km. Chabungbam Memota Devi vs Smt. Chabungbam Ningol Thokchom Ongbi ... on 19 December, 2024
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 10 On perusal of the impugned judgment and decree, the Ld. Trial
Court after examination of 3 (three) PWs and hearing the parties, after considering the relief sought
in the application, made the following points for determination -
1. Whether the plaintiff is the unmarried daughter of (L) Chabungbam Babudhon Singh and (late)
Chabungbam Thambal Devi or not?
2. Cause of action?
3. Reliefs.
The Ld. Trial Court at para No. 8 of her judgment passed the following:
"8. It is case of plaintiff in para Nos. 2 and 3 of her pleadings that she is unmarried
daughter of her deceased parents and this fact has been deposed by her in her
examination-in-chief as PW-1. PW-2 and PW-3 also corroborate her pleadings. By
preponderance of evidence, plaintiff had discharged the onus of proof placed on her.
Hence, point for determination No. 1 is decided in four of plaintiff."
The observation in this para indicates that the Ld. Trial Court has already granted relief sought for
by the plaintiff/appellant.
However, the observation made at para No. 9& 10 of the judgment and decree, it seems the Ld. Trial
Court has traversed beyond pleadings as the narration and observation made at the said paras are
not relief sought for by the plaintiff/appellant.
Assuming that the plaintiff/appellant included in her prayer for granting relief for declaring that the
plaintiff/appellant is entitled to the family pension for which ground, the Ld. Trial Court dismissed
the petition, the issue herein cannot be decided by the Ld. Trial Court without impleading the State
Government and Accountant Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 11 General as parties and hearing them
as they will be the necessary parties. Accordingly, we are of the view that the decision made therein
isnot correct.
[9] The issue herein to be decided by this Court is whether relief not asked for by a party could be
granted or not. In this regard, we are relying on the following decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
In 2022 SCC OnLine 928 [Akella Lalitha V. Konda Hanumantha Rao & Anr.], the Hon'ble Supreme
Court framed 3 (three) issues i.e. "(a) The appellant i.e. Akella Lalitha would be the natural guardian
of the child, but shall be under obligation to bring the child to residence of the respondents in such a
way that the child will be with them for a period of 2 days during winter vacation. The respondents
shall also be entitled to see the child in the residence of the appellants, with prior intimation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/136633029/ 9
Km. Chabungbam Memota Devi vs Smt. Chabungbam Ningol Thokchom Ongbi ... on 19 December, 2024
(b) The appellant shall complete the formalities for restoration of the surname and father's surname
of the child within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order; and
(c) So far as the name of the father of the child is concerned, it is directed that wherever the records
permit, the name of the natural father shall be shown and if it is otherwise impermissible, the name
of Ravi Narasimha Sarma, shall be mentioned as step-father."
In the present case, we are concerned with the finding of the Hon'ble Supreme Court for issue No.
(c) as mentioned above. In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para No. 16, 17 & 18 observed
that -
"16. Coming to address the second issue, while this Court is not apathetic to the
predicament of the respondent grandparents, it is a fact that absolutely no relief was
ever sought by them for the change of surname of the child to that Mat. App. No. 4 of
2024 Page 12 of first husband/son of respondents. It is settled law that relief not
found on pleadings should not be granted. If a Court considers or grants a relief for
which no prayer or pleading was made depriving the respondent of an opportunity to
oppose or resist such relief, it would lead to miscarriage of justice.
17. In the case of Trojan & Co. Ltd. V. Rm. N.N. Nagappa Chettiar, this Court
considered the issue as to whether relief not asked for by a party could be granted
and that too without having proper pleadings. The Court held as under:
"It is well settled that the decision of a case cannot be based on grounds outside the
pleadings of the parties and it is the case pleaded that has to be found. Without an
amendment of the plaint, the Court was not entitled to grant the relief not asked for
and no prayer was ever made to amend the plaint so as to incorporate in it an
alternative case."
18. In the case of Bharat Amratlal Kothari v. Dosukhan Samadkha Sindhi held:
"Though the Court has very wide discretion in granting relief, the Court, however,
cannot, ignoring and keeping aside the norms and principles governing grant of
relief, grant a relief not even prayed for by the petitioner."
[10] Again, we are relying on (2010) 11 SCC 557 [Manohar Lal (Dead) by LRs. V. Urgasen (Dead) by
LRs. &Ors.]. In this case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court framed 3 (three) issues; they are namely -
"(a) As to whether the State Government, a revisional authority under the statute,
could take upon itself the task of a lower statutory authority?
(b) Whether the order passed or action taken by a statutory authority in
contravention of the interim order of the Court is enforceable? and

Km. Chabungbam Memota Devi vs Smt. Chabungbam Ningol Thokchom Ongbi ... on 19 December, 2024
(c) Whether the Court can grant relief which had not been asked for?"
[11] The Hon'ble Supreme Court relating to the issue No. (c) in para Nos. 30, 31, 32, 33 & 34
observed as thus-
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 13 "30. In Trojan & Co. v. Nagappa Chettiar this Court considered the
issue as to whether relief not asked for by a party could be granted and that too without having
proper pleadings. The Court held as under : (AIR p. 240, para 22) "22. ....... It is well settled that the
decision of a case cannot be based on grounds outside the pleadings of the parties and it is the case
pleaded that has to be found. Without an amendment of the plain, the court was not entitled to
grant the relief not asked for and no prayer was ever made to amend the plaint so as to incorporate
in it an alternative case."
31. A similar view has been reiterated by this Court in Krishna Priya Ganguly v. University of
Lucknow and Om Prakash v. Ram Kumar observing that a party cannot be granted a relief which is
not claimed.
32. Dealing with the same issue, this Court in Bharat Amratlal Kothari v. Dosukhan Samadkha
Sindhi held : (SCC p. 246, para 30) "30. ...... Though the court has very wide discretion in granting
relief, the court, however, cannot, ignoring and keeping aside the norms and principles governing
grant of relief, grant a relief not even prayed for by the petitioner."
33. In Fertilizer Corpn. Of India Ltd. v. Sarat Chandra Rath this Court held that "the High Court
ought not to have granted reliefs to the respondents which they had not even prayed for."
34. In view of the above, law on the issue can be summarized that the court cannot grant a relief
which has not been specifically prayed by the parties. The instant case requires to be examined in
the light of the aforesaid certain legal propositions."
[12] In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case and for reasons and findings given
herein above and the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the above cases, we are of the
considered view that the instant case is squarely covered by the observation and finding made by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court.
Mat. App. No. 4 of 2024 Page 14
[13] Accordingly, the judgment and decree made by the Ld.
Trial Court made at para No. 9 to 13 are set aside and the observation made at para No. 8 is upheld
and accordingly declared that "the plaintiff is the unmarried daughter of late Chabungbam
Babudhon Singh and Chabungbam Thambal Devi".
As regards, the prayer No. V made in the present matrimonial appeal i.e. "to pass decree declaring
that the plaintiff/appellant is entitled to the family pension." , we are not inclined to make any
observation in this regard as this is not an issue in the present appeal.
