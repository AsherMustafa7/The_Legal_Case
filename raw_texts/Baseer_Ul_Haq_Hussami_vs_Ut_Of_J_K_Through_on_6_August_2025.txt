i) Writ, order or direction including one in the nature of Certiorari :-
a) quashing the impugned order- Annexure-l so far as the same pertains to the
promotion of respondents 5 and 6 over the head of the petitioner in the post of the
Head Assistant;
b) quashing the impugned order Annexure-ll rejecting the petitioner's representation
by a non-speaking order;
c) quashing the impugned entry of "below average" in the annual confidential report
of the petitioner for the year 2020, as conveyed to her vide communications dated
4-12-2022 and 17-1-2023 (Annexures -III and IV).
ii) Writ, order or direction including one in the nature of Mandamus, commanding
upon the respondents not to give any effect to the impugned orders and with a
further direction upon them to accord consideration to the claim of the petitioner for
her promotion to the post of Head Assistant w.e.f 24-11-2022, without taking into
consideration the adverse uncommunicated ACR of the year 2020 and grant her all
the benefits of seniority, pay and grade alongwith arrears.
FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE
1. The petitioner, a Senior Assistant in the High Court of J&K and Ladakh, challenges the order
dated 24.11.2022, whereby she was denied promotion to the post of the Head Assistant and
superseded by her juniors. The respondents justified the denial on the ground that the petitioner
secured only 54% (19 points) in the assessment of her Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the
period 2017-2021, falling short of the mandatory 65% aggregate marks prescribed under Order No.
415 dated 05.10.2020. The petitioner contends that the
3|Page WP(C)323/2023 adverse ACRs recorded for 2019-2021 were never communicated to her,
violating her right to make representations against them. She further contends that the guidelines
applied for her assessment were originally framed for the post of Gazetted staff and could not be
extended to her post without publication by way of a notification, rendering them inapplicable and
unenforceable. The petitioner seeks directions for her promotion with retrospective effect from the
date her juniors were promoted.
2. The respondents, on the other hand, admit that there is no record of communication of adverse
ACRs but submitted that the petitioner's failure to achieve the 65% aggregate marks, disqualified
her from promotion. The further stand of the respondents 2 to 4 is that the petitioner did not
challenge the validity of Order No. 415 in her writ petition, and as such, no relief can be granted on
this ground. They further contend that publication of the executive order by way of a notification
was not required in the absence of any statutory mandate and that the order operates both
retrospectively and prospectively for assessing promotions. Even if Order No. 415 is excluded, the
respondents submit that promotions to the post of Head Assistant are based on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 2
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
seniority-cum-merit, and evaluation of ACRs remains an integral part of the process. Accordingly,
they pray for dismissal of the writ petition while assuring that the petitioner's case for promotion
will be considered in future as per the applicable rules and practices.
4|Page WP(C)323/2023 SUBMISSIONS ON THE BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
3. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, submits that the impugned orders denying
promotion to the petitioner are illegal, arbitrary, and contrary to settled principles of law, and are
liable to be quashed. The said orders are based on an adverse Annual Confidential Report (ACR) for
the year 2020, which was not communicated to the petitioner at the relevant time. The failure to
communicate the adverse ACR deprives the petitioner of an opportunity to represent against the
same, which is a fundamental violation of law.
4. It is the specific case of the petitioner that the respondents, while considering her case for
promotion, were not aware of the fact that the petitioner had rendered unblemished service for over
fifteen years, except for the alleged adverse ACR for 2020. This aspect of the matter was deliberately
concealed and suppressed by the authorities in their decision-making process. The respondents
failed to appreciate that the petitioner was on sanctioned medical leave for a substantial period in
2020 and that the entire year was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the
petitioner was not engaged in any misconduct that could justify a "below average"
rating in her ACR.
5. The learned senior counsel, Mr. Haqani, further submits that the non-
communication of the adverse ACR to the petitioner goes to the root of the case and renders the
denial of promotion legally unsustainable.
5|Page WP(C)323/2023
6. Learned senior counsel also submits that the respondents have committed a grave illegality by
rejecting the petitioner's representation vide a non-speaking order dated 16.12.2022. Such an order,
passed without assigning reasons, reflects complete non- application of mind and violates the
settled principle that reasons are the soul of administrative and quasi-judicial decisions.
7. The learned counsel highlights that the petitioner was senior to respondents No. 5 and 6 in the
seniority list and was otherwise fully eligible for promotion. Denial of promotion to the petitioner,
while promoting her juniors, is a clear case of supersession and violates the principle of
seniority-cum-merit applicable in such cases.
8. It is further submitted that the respondents have mechanically applied guidelines for assessment
and promotion which were neither applicable to the post of the petitioner nor duly published or
notified. This lack of proper procedure reflects arbitrariness and renders the impugned orders
legally unsustainable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 3
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
9. Learned Counsel lastly submits that the petitioner has been subjected to serious prejudice as a
result of the impugned orders and prays that the impugned orders be quashed. It is further prayed
that the respondents be directed to consider the petitioner's claim for promotion to the post of Head
Assistant w.e.f. 24.11.2022, with all consequential benefits, without taking into account the
uncommunicated and unjustified ACR for the year 2020.
6|Page WP(C)323/2023 SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
10. Per Contra, The Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submits that the writ
petition filed by the petitioner is devoid of merit, misconceived, and liable to be dismissed. The
denial of promotion to the petitioner is neither arbitrary nor illegal but is based on objective criteria
and service records duly considered by the competent authority.
11. It is submitted that the petitioner failed to secure the mandatory aggregate of 65% marks in her
Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the preceding five years, as required under Order No. 415
dated 05.10.2020. This order, issued with the approval of the Hon'ble Chief Justice and
Administrative Committee of the High Court, lays down a uniform standard for evaluating merit in
promotions and has been consistently applied for all non-gazetted posts in the High Court over the
last several years.
12. The learned counsel further submits that the petitioner has not challenged the validity or legality
of Order No. 415 in her writ petition, and no relief has been sought against it in the prayer clause. In
the absence of such a challenge, the petitioner cannot now contend that the said order is
inapplicable to her case. Reliance is placed on Mukesh Singh Kushwah v. State of MP, 2002 (1) SCC
598, wherein it was held that a relief not claimed, cannot be granted by the Court.
13. It is the specific case of the respondents that the petitioner's adverse ACR for the year 2020,
though not formally communicated, was duly recorded in the service records and formed part of the
assessment
7|Page WP(C)323/2023 process for promotions. The absence of formal communication does not by
itself vitiate the assessment, especially when the evaluation is based on cumulative service records.
14. Learned counsel, Mr. M.I. Qadari, Senior Advocate, submits that the stand of the petitioner,
requiring publication of executive orders in the Gazette is misplaced. There is no statutory mandate
under the applicable service rules requiring publication of Order No. 415 in the official Gazette. The
order was issued as an administrative instruction to streamline promotions and ensure merit-based
advancement.
15. It is further submitted that even if Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is excluded, the principle of
seniority-cum-merit as envisaged under Order No. 517 dated 24.10.2008 requires consideration of
both seniority and merit. The petitioner's merit was duly assessed on the basis of her ACRs for the
preceding five years, and she did not meet the required standard for promotion.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 4
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
16. Learned senior counsel further emphasizes that the petitioner's supersession does not violate
any of her rights, as promotion is not a matter of right but is subject to availability of posts and
suitability of the candidate. The respondents acted in accordance with established practice and
procedure while denying promotion to the petitioner.
17. In view of the above, the learned counsel for the respondents submits that the impugned orders
are legal, justified, and passed after due consideration of the petitioner's service record. The writ
petition is without merit and liable to be dismissed.
8|Page WP(C)323/2023 ISSUES TAKEN UP FOR DETERMINATION
18. Heard learned counsel for both the parties at length and carefully perused the material on
record. The following issues arise for determination:
Issue no. i: Whether the non-communication of adverse entries in the petitioner's
Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) renders the respondent's decision to deny
promotion legally unsustainable.
Issue no. ii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, originally applicable to gazetted
staff, could have been extended and applied to non-gazetted staff without proper notification
highlighting the revised benchmark for promotion?
Issue no. iii: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates retrospectively so as to govern the
consideration of promotions pertaining to a period prior to its issuance.
Issue no. iv: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual Confidential Report (ACR) for the
year 2020 during the period of her sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19, without due
communication of the recorded remarks irrespective of whether they were favourable, average, or
adverse vitiates the procedural fairness required under service jurisprudence.
LEGAL ANALYSIS
19. The issues framed above are now taken up for determination by us.
Each issue is examined individually in the following paragraphs, upon a careful consideration of the
pleadings, the evidence placed on record, and the applicable legal principles as expounded in
judicial precedents.
20. ISSUE No. I: Whether the non-communication of adverse Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)
vitiates the respondent's decision to deny promotion to the petitioner.
At the very core of the petitioner's grievance lies the allegation that her promotion was denied on the
basis of adverse entries in her
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 5
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
9|Page WP(C)323/2023 Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and 2021,
which were admittedly never communicated to her. This Court considers it essential to first address
this issue, as it strikes at the foundation of fairness, transparency, and adherence to the principles of
natural justice in service jurisprudence. We find it imperative to first address the issue of
non-communication of adverse ACRs, as it strikes at the heart of fairness and natural justice in
public service law.
21. Before deciding the above issue, we deem it proper to refer to the judgment rendered by The
Apex Court in, Dev Dutt v. Union of India, (2008) 8 SCC 725, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
unequivocally held that:
"17. In our opinion, every entry in the ACR of a public servant must be communicated
to him within a reasonable period, whether it is a poor, fair, average, good or very
good entry. This is because non-communication of such an entry may adversely affect
the employee in two ways: (1) had the entry been communicated to him he would
know about the assessment of his work and conduct by his superiors, which would
enable him to improve his work in future: (2) he would have an opportunity of
making a representation against the entry if he feels it is unjustified, and pray for its
upgradation. Hence, non- communication of an entry is arbitrary, and it has been
held by the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of
India? that arbitrariness violates Article 14 of the Constitution."
22. The Court reasoned that the right of an employee to be informed of any adverse material
recorded in their service dossier is a fundamental facet of fairness, accountability, and transparency
in service jurisprudence. This right assumes greater significance where such adverse material is
proposed to be relied upon to deny promotional benefits or career advancement. The principles of
audi 10 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 alteram partem, which mandate that no individual shall be
condemned unheard, apply with full force to service matters where adverse entries in Annual
Confidential Reports (ACRs) have a direct bearing on the employee's rights and legitimate
expectations. Denial of such an opportunity not only violates natural justice but also renders any
decision based on uncommunicated material, legally unsustainable.
23. The law laid down by the Apex Court in Dev Dutt v. Union of India, (2008) has been reiterated
in Sukhdev Singh vs. Union Of India and others, 2013 (9) SCC 566 as under:
"5. In paras 37 and 41 of the Report this Court then observed as follows: (Dev Dutt
case-, SCC pp. 737-38) "37. We further hold that when the entry is communicated to
him the public servant should have a right to make a representation against the entry
to the authority concerned, and the authority concerned must decide the
representation in a fair manner and within a reasonable period. We also hold that the
representation must be decided by an authority higher than the one who gave the
entry, otherwise the likelihood is that the representation will be summarily rejected
without adequate consideration as it would be an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. All
this would be conducive to fairness and transparency in public administration, and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 6
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
would result in fairness to public servants. The State must be a model employer, and
must act fairly towards its employees. Only then would good governance be possible
41. In our opinion, non-communication of entries in the annual confidential report of
a public servant, whether he is in civil, judicial, police or any other service (other than
the military), certainly has civil consequences because it may affect his chances for
promotion or get other benefits (as already discussed above). Hence, such
non-communication would be arbitrary, and as such violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution."
24. It is a well-established principle in service jurisprudence that any adverse entry in the Annual
Confidential Report (ACR) must be communicated to the concerned employee in a timely manner,
11 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 particularly when such entry is likely to affect the employee's service
prospects, including promotion.
25. Keeping in view the above, we find that lowering down of ACRs from "very good" to "below
average" would require the respondents to give an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner after
conveying the said remarks.
26. In the present case, the respondents have admitted that the adverse Annual Confidential
Reports (ACRs) for the years 2019-2020 and 2021 were not communicated to the petitioner, thereby
depriving her of the opportunity to make a representation or seek their review in accordance with
law. The consideration of such uncommunicated entries while denying her promotion is in violation
of the principles of natural justice, particularly the rule of audi alteram partem, and is manifestly
arbitrary, thus offending Article 14 of the Constitution. As laid down in Dev Dutt v. Union of India
and consistently reiterated in subsequent judgments, the reliance on uncommunicated adverse
remarks in ACRs vitiates the entire promotion process, rendering the consequential decision invalid
and unsustainable in law. The respondents' failure to adhere to the mandatory requirement of
communication has, therefore, not only infringed the petitioner's statutory and constitutional rights
but has also tainted the selection process with illegality.
27. Therefore, we hold that the non-communication of the relevant ACRs is the most fundamental
flaw and strikes at the very root of the decision-making process adopted by the respondents. It
constitutes a 12 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 grave violation of the principles of natural justice and
renders the entire exercise manifestly arbitrary and procedurally unfair. Such a fundamental defect
cannot be cured or overlooked and decision taken by the respondents by virtue of orders impugned,
cannot sustain the test of law and is liable to be rejected.
Issue no. I, is decided accordingly.
28. ISSUE No.II: Whether Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, originally applicable to
gazetted staff, could have been extended and applied to non-gazetted staff without proper
notification highlighting the revised benchmark for promotion?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 7
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
29. Upon a careful examination of the material on record and in light of the settled legal principles,
this Court is of the considered view that Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, which
prescribed a revised benchmark of 65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) for
promotion, was originally intended to apply to gazetted staff only, and its subsequent extension to
non-gazetted staff without any formal notification or publication, amounts to a procedural illegality.
30. The records reveal that there was no contemporaneous notification, office memorandum, or
circular issued by the Registrar General or the Administrative Department that expressly made the
said executive order applicable to non-gazetted employees. No attempt was made to notify or
circulate the revised benchmark among non-gazetted employees, nor was any opportunity afforded
to them to acquaint 13 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 themselves with or prepare for the application of
such an elevated standard.
31. In the absence of any such formal notification, the affected category of non-gazetted staff had no
reasonable means of knowing that the eligibility criteria for promotion had been altered. The
fundamental principles of natural justice demand that rules or standards that impose new
obligations or alter existing service conditions, must be duly published and communicated to those
affected.
32. With a view to fortify this principle, we deem it proper to refer to the judgement passed by the
Apex Court in Harla v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1951 SC 467, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court
authoritatively held:
9. Natural justice requires that before a law can become operative it must be
promulgated or published. It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all
men may know what it is; or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or
regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be
acquired with the exercise of due and reasonable diligence. The thought that a
decision reached in the secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no
access and to which even their accredited representatives have no access and of
which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless affect their lives, liberty and
property by the mere passing of a resolution without anything more is abhorrent to
civilised man. It shocks his conscience. In the absence therefore of any law, rule,
regulation or custom, we hold that a law cannot come into being in this way.
Promulgation or publication of some reasonable sort is essential.
33. This principle flows from the broader doctrine of audi alteram partem and the right to natural
justice, as individuals cannot be expected to comply with unknown norms or be penalised for their
breach.
34. Similarly, in B.K. Srinivasan v. State of Karnataka, (1987) 1 SCC 658, the Hon'ble Supreme Court
reiterated:
14 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 8
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
15. There can be no doubt about the proposition that where a law, whether
parliamentary or subordinate, demands compliance, those that are governed must be
notified directly and reliably of the law and all changes and additions made to it by
various processes. Whether law is viewed from the standpoint of the "conscientious
good man" seeking to abide by the law or from the standpoint of justice Holmes's
"unconscientious bad man" seeking to avoid the law, law must be known, that is to
say, it must be so made that it can be known. We know that delegated or subordinate
legislation is all-pervasive and that there is hardly any field of activity where
governance by delegated or subordinate legislative powers is not as important if not
more important, than governance by parliamentary legislation. But unlike
parliamentary legislation which is publicly made, delegated or subordinate legislation
is often made unobtrusively in the chambers of a Minister, a Secretary to the
Government or other official dignitary. It is, therefore, necessary that subordinate
legislation, in order to take effect, must be published or promulgated in some suitable
manner, whether such publication or promulgation is prescribed by the parent
statute or not. It will then take effect from the date of such publication or
promulgation. Where the parent statute prescribes the mode of publication or
promulgation that mode must be followed. Where the parent statute is silent, but the
subordinate legislation itself prescribes the manner of publication, such a mode of
publication may be sufficient, if reasonable. If the subordinate legislation does not
prescribe the mode of publication or if the subordinate legislation prescribes a plainly
unreasonable mode of publication, it will take effect only when it is published
through the customarily recognised official channel, namely, the Official Gazette or
some other reasonable mode of publication. There may be subordinate legislation
which is concerned with a few individuals or is confined to small local areas. In such
cases publication or promulgation by other means may be sufficient.
The court further observed that administrative instructions, even if validly issued, must be
publicised effectively if they alter existing rights or impose new burdens.
35. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as R.Ranjith Singh & Ors v State Of Tamil Nadu & Ors.
reported as 2025 SCC Online SC 1009, has made it clear that:
21. This Court in case of Jaiveer Singh v State of Utrakhand 2023INSC 1204 has held
as under:
34. It can thus be seen that it is a trite law that the Government cannot amend or
supersede statutory rules by administrative instructions, but if the rules are silent on
any particular point, it can fill up the gaps and supplement the rules and issue 15 | P a
g e WP(C)323/2023 instructions not inconsistent with the rules already framed. It is
a settled proposition of law that an authority cannot issue orders/office
memorandum/ executive instructions in contravention of the statutory rules.
However, instructions can be issued only to supplement the statutory rules but not to
supplant it. This Court has again held in the aforesaid case that the Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 9
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
cannot issue executive instructions in contravention of the statutory rule.
In the present case, Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, which introduced a new benchmark
for promotion eligibility, was neither traceable to any statutory rule nor duly notified or
communicated to the affected employees. Its retrospective application, therefore, not only offends
the principle of administrative fairness and transparency but also violates the doctrine of legitimate
expectation. The attempt to apply the benchmark fixed under Executive Order No. 415, originally
confined to gazetted staff, to non-gazetted employees without any formal notification or publication
is wholly arbitrary and violates the doctrine of legitimate expectation and administrative fairness.
36. Moreover, nothing has been placed on record to show that the Registrar General, after obtaining
approval from the Hon'ble Chief Justice as the competent authority, ever took steps to formally
notify this change or to make it applicable to the cadre of non-gazetted employees. This constitutes a
serious administrative omission, particularly when the order was used to deny promotion to the
petitioner.
16 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
37. In light of the above, this Court holds that Executive Order No. 415 could not have been extended
to non-gazetted employees without formal notification and communication, especially when it
introduced a substantive change in promotion criteria. The failure to notify the same has resulted in
denial of due opportunity to the petitioner, rendering the action arbitrary and violative of Articles 14
and 16 of the Constitution of India.
38. ISSUE NO. III: Whether Executive Order No. 415 operates retrospectively so as to govern the
consideration of promotions pertaining to a period prior to its issuance.
It is now trite in law that executive orders or administrative instructions altering service conditions
cannot operate retrospectively unless the language of the order expressly provides for such an effect.
Retrospective application is generally frowned upon as it offends the principles of fairness and
violates vested rights.
39. This principle was reiterated in State of Punjab v. Bhajan Kaur, (2008) 12 SCC 112, where the
Apex Court observed:
"9. A statute is presumed to be prospective unless held to be retrospective, either
expressly or by necessary implication. A substantive law is presumed to be
prospective. It is one of the facets of the rule of law."
40. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled Madishetti Bala Ramul v. Land Acquisition
Officer reported in (2007) 9 SCC 650 has held as under:
19. In Land Acquisition Officer-cum-SWO v. B.V. Reddy and Sons this Court opined
that Section 25 being not a procedural provision will have no retrospective effect,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 10
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
holding :
(SCC p. 471, para 6) "6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of
construction that a substantive provision cannot be retrospective in nature unless the
provision itself indicates the same. The amended provision of Section 25 nowhere
indicates that the same 17 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 would have any retrospective
effect. Consequently, therefore, it would apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to
24-9-1984, the date on which Act 68 of 1984 came into force. The Land Acquisition
(Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in Parliament on 30-4-1982 and came into
operation with effect from 24-9-1984.
41. In the present case, Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 introduced a new criterion of securing 65%
aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) as a precondition for promotion. The
petitioner's case for promotion was under consideration for the period 2017-2021, a substantial
portion of which precedes the issuance of the impugned order.
42. The application of the newly introduced ACR criterion of securing 65% aggregate marks to the
period in question effectively alter the service conditions of the petitioner in a retrospective manner.
Such application prejudices her vested right to be considered for promotion under the previously
existing criteria, which did not prescribe any minimum aggregate threshold for ACRs.
43. In the present case, the application of Order No. 415 introduces a new obligation requiring
employees to secure a minimum of 65% aggregate marks in their Annual Confidential Reports
(ACRs) for eligibility to promotion. This requirement is sought to be enforced in respect of past
years for which the petitioner's ACRs had already been recorded without any prior knowledge of
such a threshold. Imposing this condition retrospectively, squarely falls within the mischief of
retrospective operation and is legally impermissible. 18 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
44. The Honble Apex court in case titled as Land Acquisition Officer Cum DSWO, A.P v. B.V. Reddy
& Sons, reported in (2002) 3 SCC 463 has consistently held that:
"6. Coming to the second question, it is a well-settled principle of construction that a
substantive provision cannot be retrospective in nature unless the provision itself
indicates the same. The amended provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates that the
same would have any retrospective effect. Consequently, therefore, it would apply to
all acquisitions made subsequent to 24-9-1984, the date on which Act 68 of 1984
came into force. The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in
Parliament on 30-4-1982 and came into operation with effect from 24-9-1984. Under
the amendment in question, the provisions of Section 23(2) dealing with solatium
were amended and Section 30(2) of the amended Act provided that the provisions of
subsection (2) of Section 23 of the principal Act as amended by clause (b) of Section

principal Act, after 30-4-1982 and before the commencement of the Act. It is because
of the aforesaid provision, the question cropped up as to whether in respect of an
award passed by the Collector between the two dates, the amended provision will
have an application or not and that question has been answered by this Court in the
Constitution Bench decision in Union of India v. Raghubir Singh. Sub-section (2) of
Section 30 has at all no reference to the provisions of Section 25 of the Act. In that
view of the matter, question of applicability of the amended provisions of Section 25
of the Act to an award of the Collector made earlier to the amendment and the matter
was pending in appeal, does not arise. In our considered opinion, the amended
provisions of Section 25 of the Act, not being retrospective in nature, the case in hand
would be governed by the unamended provisions of Section 25 of the Act."

45. We are firmly of the view that the retrospective application of Executive Order No. 415 dated
05.10.2020 to promotion processes covering the period from 2017 to 2021 is neither justified nor
legally sustainable. The said order introduced a new eligibility condition requiring 65% aggregate
marks in the ACRs which was neither notified nor communicated to the employees concerned at the
relevant time. As such, the petitioner and similarly placed employees were deprived of an fair
opportunity to comply with or address this new requirement. Imposing such a standard
retrospectively not only unsettles vested rights but also causes serious prejudice and administrative
uncertainty. Revisiting settled promotions after several years disturbs the finality of service matters,
generates avoidable litigation, and undermines institutional fairness. In our view, enforcing an
unpublished and uncommunicated executive instruction with retrospective effect is arbitrary,
unreasonable, and impermissible both in law and in equity.
46. Accordingly, the respondents' attempt to apply the new standard introduced under Executive
Order No. 415 requiring a minimum of 65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs)
to the petitioner's case is legally unsustainable. Such retrospective application of a criterion that was
neither in existence nor communicated during the relevant assessment years directly offends the
well-settled principle of non- retrospectivity in service law. It also violates the guarantee of fairness
and equality enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution, as administrative authorities are 20 | P
a g e WP(C)323/2023 required to act in a just, transparent, and non-arbitrary manner. Moreover,
this action undermines the doctrine of legitimate expectation, which protects employees from
arbitrary alterations of service conditions and ensures that they are not prejudiced by changes
introduced without adequate prior notice or opportunity to adjust their conduct.
47. Order No. 415, having been issued on 05.10.2020, cannot lawfully be applied to the petitioner's
case retrospectively. Thus, we hold that, its application to a period prior to its issuance is legally
unsustainable, arbitrary, and violative of the petitioner's rights. Issue no. III is decided, accordingly.
48. ISSUE NO. IV: Whether the recording of the petitioner's Annual Confidential Report (ACR) for
the year 2020 during the period of her sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19, without due
communication of the recorded remarks irrespective of whether they were favourable, average, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 12
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
adverse vitiates the procedural fairness required under service jurisprudence?
49. An ACR is meant to be an objective assessment of an employee's performance, conduct, and
work output during a defined reporting period. When an employee is on sanctioned leave
particularly for medical reasons such as COVID-19, he or she is not actively discharging duties and
therefore cannot be evaluated on performance metrics during that time. Recording adverse remarks
under such circumstances can be inherently unfair and arbitrary, as it is not based on active service
or observable conduct during the period in question. Further, the principles of natural justice
demand that any evaluation which may adversely affect an employee's rights such as eligibility 21 | P
a g e WP(C)323/2023 for promotion or career advancement must be transparent, fair, and
objectively grounded. An adverse ACR recorded while the employee was legitimately absent from
duty violates this principle, as the employee has no opportunity to demonstrate performance or
defend against subjective assessments.
50. Moreover, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dev Dutt v.
Union of India [(2008) 8 SCC 725], even non-adverse or 'average' entries must be communicated if
they can impact promotional prospects. It logically follows that adverse remarks recorded during a
period of sanctioned leave, without any valid basis tied to actual performance, must be
communicated with reasons and an opportunity for the employee to represent against them. Failing
to do so renders such entries procedurally and substantively defective. In addition, departmental
rules, executive instructions, and settled judicial precedent all underscore that recording of ACRs
must reflect actual work and conduct not presumptions or administrative convenience.
51. In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned leave especially without due
communication cannot withstand legal scrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also
vitiates the evaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to fair consideration in
matters of promotion, postings, and other service benefits.
22 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
52. It is the specific stand of the petitioner that she was on duly sanctioned medical leave for a
substantial period in 2020 owing to COVID-19 and related complications. Despite this, her
performance for that year was assessed as "below average." Recording an adverse Annual
Confidential Report (ACR) during a period of sanctioned leave raises serious questions about the
fairness, legality, and propriety of such an evaluation.
53. The law is clear that no adverse remark can be made in an ACR unless it is based on concrete
material reflecting actual work or misconduct during the reporting period.
54. In the present case, there is no material on record to show that the petitioner was either engaged
in any work or guilty of any misconduct during her sanctioned leave. Rather, the respondents
appear to have mechanically recorded a "below average" rating without assessing whether she had
an opportunity to demonstrate her performance. Such action fails the test of fairness,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 13
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
non-arbitrariness, and application of mind, which are cornerstones of service jurisprudence.
55. This Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic constituted an
extraordinary public health emergency, wherein employees across the spectrum were affected
physically and psychologically. Many were absent from work not by choice, but due to circumstances
beyond their control. To penalise an employee for absence during such a period, particularly when
the leave was duly 23 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 sanctioned, is not only legally untenable but also
violates the principles of equity and humane administration.
56. In light of the above, recording an adverse ACR during sanctioned leave especially without due
communication cannot withstand legal scrutiny. It is not only administratively improper, but also
vitiates the evaluation process, thereby compromising the employee's right to fair consideration in
matters of promotion, postings, and other service benefits.
57. Therefore, we hold that recording a "below average" ACR for the petitioner during her period of
sanctioned medical leave for COVID- 19, is patently unjustified, arbitrary, and legally unsustainable.
The said adverse entry is liable to be set aside, and any reliance on it for denying her promotion, is
illegal and vitiates the entire process of consideration.
Issue no. IV, is decided accordingly.
CONCLUSION
58. In light of the foregoing analysis, we find that the denial of promotion to the petitioner on the
basis of uncommunicated adverse Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs), amounts to a gross violation
of the principles of natural justice. It is a settled position in law that any material adverse to the
interest of an employee, if relied upon to deny promotion or other career advancement must be duly
communicated so as to enable the employee to make an effective representation. The failure of the
respondents to communicate such ACRs deprived the 24 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 petitioner of this
vital procedural safeguard and renders the entire process unsustainable in law.
59. Further, we hold that Executive Order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020, which imposes conditions
materially affecting the service rights and legitimate expectations of employees, required proper
publication, either in the Official Gazette or through another effective mode of communication. In
the absence of such publication or communication, the said order cannot be enforced against the
petitioner. Administrative instructions that remain un-notified, cannot be used to alter the service
conditions of employees to their detriment.
60. The retrospective application of Executive Order No. 415, dated 05.10.2020, to govern
promotions for a period predating its issuance, is wholly untenable in law. It is a settled principle in
service jurisprudence that administrative orders or executive instructions altering service conditions
cannot operate retrospectively unless there is clear and express statutory sanction authorising such
retrospective effect. In the present case, the respondents have sought to apply the newly introduced
criterion of securing a minimum of 65% aggregate marks in Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 14
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
the petitioner's promotion assessment for the period 2017-2021. This approach is legally
impermissible, as it imposes an additional eligibility condition for a period during which the
petitioner had no notice or opportunity to meet such a requirement. The respondents' reliance on
this uncommunicated and un-notified order to retrospectively deny the 25 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
petitioner her due consideration for promotion, not only contravenes the principles of fairness and
non-arbitrariness under Article 14 of the Constitution but also prejudices her vested right to be
assessed under the criteria that was in force during the relevant time.
61. Further, the stand taken by the respondents that the criteria prescribed under executive order
no.415 are intended to apply to non-gazetted staff, does not absolve them of their obligation to
ensure wide publicity and due notification of the said order. The respondents were duty bound to
notify all employees, including those to whom the rules would apply, so that they could be made
aware of the applicability of the benchmark criteria. Mere internal application or selective
enforcement cannot suffice to meet the requirement of transparency and procedural fairness.
62. If the intention was to extend the applicability of the 65% benchmark, which was originally
framed for gazetted officers, to non-gazetted staff as well, then the respondents ought to have either
amended the relevant rules or issued a formal corrigendum clarifying the same. Only upon such due
notification could employees be expected to make a conscious and informed effort to achieve the
prescribed benchmark. Failure to do so renders the application of the criteria arbitrary and
unsustainable in law.
63. In the absence of any published notification or formal communication extending the
applicability of the benchmark to non-gazetted employees, it is unreasonable to expect them to
anticipate such standards or orient their performance accordingly. The retrospective 26 | P a g e
WP(C)323/2023 application of the rule that was neither made known nor duly enforced is plainly
contrary to law. It violates the principle of legal certainty, non-arbitrariness and article 14 of the
constitution.
64. We are of the considered view that the respondents were legally bound to give vide publicity to
the order if they intended to apply it to the non-gazetted employees. They cannot rely on internal
decisions or informal practices when the consequences affect the service rights of individuals.
Without proper publication, affected employees cannot be expected to follow or comply with such
criteria.
65. Critically, the recording of an adverse ACR for the year 2020 when the petitioner was on
sanctioned medical leave due to COVID-19 pandemic, is patently arbitrary and unsupported by any
material. Penalising an employee for a period of illness beyond her control, particularly during a
global pandemic, violates not only established legal principles but also the broader tenets of fairness
and equity in public employment.
66. Judicial precedents lend unequivocal support to the petitioner's case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45500502/ 15
Baseer -Ul- Haq Hussami vs Ut Of J&K Through on 6 August, 2025
Courts have consistently held that uncommunicated adverse entries and unpublished administrative
instructions cannot form the basis for adverse decisions affecting employees' service rights. The
petitioner's claim for promotion with retrospective effect from the date on which her juniors were
promoted is, therefore, well founded and deserves to be upheld.
67. In weighing the equities of the case, we are persuaded that the petitioner has suffered substantial
prejudice due to administrative 27 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023 lapses, entirely beyond her control.
Granting the relief sought would not only vindicate her individual rights but also affirm
constitutional values of fairness, equality, and accountability in public service. It would serve as a
necessary reminder to the executive of the importance of maintaining transparent and just
administrative practices.
68. Before parting, we direct the Registrar General of the High Court of J&K and Ladakh that if
executive order No. 415 dated 05.10.2020 is to be applied to the non-gazetted staff of the High
Court, it shall be duly communicated, notified, and published through appropriate mode to ensure
that all affected employees are given proper notice of its contents and implications and issue a
formal notification applying executive order No. 415 to non-gazetted employees only after obtaining
approval from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court. The notification shall specifically
mention the benchmark criteria and its effective date.
69. Any attempt to enforce the said order without adherence to these procedural safeguards, shall
render its application vulnerable to legal challenge.
70. In view of the above findings, the writ petition is allowed and disposed of in the following
manner :
i) Quashing the impugned order Annexure-ll rejecting the petitioner's representation
without assigning any cogent reasons for such rejection.
28 | P a g e WP(C)323/2023
ii) Quashing the impugned entry of "below average" in the annual confidential report of the
petitioner for the year 2020.
71. We further hold that the impugned action denying the petitioner's promotion cannot be
sustained in law. Accordingly, the respondents are directed to accord consideration to the claim of
petitioner for promotion to the post of Head Assistant with retrospective effect from the date her
juniors were promoted i.e. 24.11.2022 as Head Assistant, and to grant her all consequential benefits
of seniority and monetary in accordance with law without taking into consideration the adverse ACR
of the year 2020.
72. Disposed of.
