Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., and he is holding the post of Managing Director in the said company. On a

No.646 of 2018 alleging that PDS rice was transported to the mill owned by the petitioner by name
Siva Modern Rice Mill. The District Revenue Officer conducted an investigation and found that the
petitioner was falsely implicated in the criminal case and there was no incriminating material
http://www.judis.nic.in against the petitioner to proceed under the Essential Commodities Act vide
proceedings dated 31.07.2009. Thereafter, as the existing passport of the petitioner expired on

renewal. While processing the petitioner's application in File No.MD1070308480917, the first

of 2018 challenging the final report and charges made against him in C.C.No. 38 of 2010 wherein
this Court has passed an order of interim stay on 21.06.2018 staying the proceedings of the criminal
case. It is further submitted that on 05.03.2020, the petitioner has been acquitted from the criminal
case in C.C.No.38 of 2010 by the Judicial Magistrate No.III, Madurai and that there is no hindrance
for the first respondent to issue passport to the petitioner.
4.The learned Central Government Standing Counsel appearing for the first respondent would
submit that on production of a copy of the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate No.III, Madurai,
acquitting the petitioner, http://www.judis.nic.in the first respondent will consider issuance of
passport to the petitioner.
5.Since it is represented by the petitioner that he has been acquitted from the criminal case as early
as on 05.03.2020, he is directed to produce a copy of the order passed in C.C.No.38 of 2010 by
Judicial Magistrate-III, Madurai, within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this
order and on such production, the first respondent shall scrutinize the said order and upon
satisfaction, shall issue passport to the petitioner within 60 days thereafter subject to the following
