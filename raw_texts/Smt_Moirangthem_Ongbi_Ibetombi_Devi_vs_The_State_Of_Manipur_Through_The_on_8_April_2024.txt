[1] Heard Mr. Ch. Robinchandra, learned counsel for the
petitioner, Mr. H. Samarjit, learned GA for the State respondent Nos. 1 to 6 and Mr. S. Samarjeet,

service of her husband, Late, M. Suresh Singh, Constable No.870007 under the Rules of Manipur
Services (Special Pension), Rules 1982. The point for determination in the present case is whether a
police personnel discharged from service as invalid as result of injuries suffered in attacks by

[3] The facts and circumstances narrated in the petition are that the petitioner's husband (Late) M.
Suresh Singh during his life time was WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 2 serving as Police Constable being
Constable No.870007 in the Department of Home, Government of Manipur and posted in the Office
of the Superintendent of Police, Senapati District. While he was in service, he had been declared as
unfit in the Government service by the State Medical Board Manipur because he was suffering from
an acute chronic mental disease after sustaining injuries in militant attack. Therefore, he was
allowed to retire from his service on invalid pension on medical ground vide order dated 29.08.1996
as issued by the Superintendent of Police, Senapati District, Manipur w.e.f. 29.08.1996. As per the
Office record as issued by the Superintendent of Police, Senapati District, Manipur vide letter dated
13.12.2005 the petitioner's husband initially entered his service as Police Constable w.e.f. 12.11.1987
and retired from service on Invalid pension with effect from 23.8.1996. The petitioner's husband
(Late) M. Suresh Singh, Ex- Constable No.870007 expired on 12.11.1996 while awaiting the
releasing of pension and other retirement benefits. During his life time he did not draw his pension
and the other retirement benefits including G.P.F. and leave Salaries etc. On his death, he left
behind his wife (the present petitioner) and his 3(three) minor sons.
[4] On the expiry of M. Suresh Singh, Ex-Constable No.870007, the Accountant General, Manipur
issued a sanction letter dated 20.05.1997 WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 3 for payment of death gratuity
of Rs.25,532.00p. (Rupees twenty five thousand five hundred thirty two) only to his wife, the
present writ petitioner. Except this small amount of death gratuity, the respondents did not pay any
amount nor granted the family pension to the petitioner till date. The said letter stated that the
payment was made on the identification as per P.P.O. No.7994. The petitioner just after the death of
her husband, M. Suresh Sigh, Ex-Constable No.870007, she had submitted all the necessary pension
papers/documents including the service book to the concerned authorities. But the respondents did
not make payment of the family pension to the petitioner as admissible according to the existing

with High Court's order dated 6.01.2015 passed in W.P. (C) No.479 of 2006 submitted the letter
dated 28.02.2015 [Annexure-A-8] to the Inspector General of Police (Adm.), Manipur, Imphal. The

R. Hopinson, IPS and C/No.867116 S. Kroni Mao are enjoying family pension under Rule 4 of
Manipur Services (Special Pension) Rules, 1982 before introduction of Manipur Liberalized Pension
Rules, 2000. Police Constable M. Suresh expired on 12.11.1996 due to injury caused by suspected

[8] Even though the Superintendent of Police, Senapati District, Manipur submitted the detailed
report of causing death of the Ex-Constable M. Suresh Sigh (Constable No.870007) and those
personnel who expired on the spot had already granted the facility of family pension under Rule 4 of
Manipur Services (Special Pension) Rules, 1982 before introduction of Manipur Liberalized Pension
Rules, 2000 the authorities failed to consider the case of the petitioner. Being aggrieved the

High Court's order being Contempt Case (C) No.151 of 2015 and in the said Contempt Case (C)
No.151 of 2015 the respondent No.1 filed an affidavit- in-opposition on 3.11.2017 before the Hon'ble

with Rule 4(i) of the Manipur Services (Special Pension) Rules, 1982 the petitioner is
entitled to enjoy the benefit of special pension for the past service of her husband, M.
Suresh Singh, Constable No.870007 because he had served more than three years
when he met the ambush occurred on 2.6.1995. Rule 4(i) of the Manipur Services

office record the petitioner's husband M. Suresh Singh joined at service on 12.11.1987
as a police constable bearing No. 870007 and he retired from service on invalid
pension and struck off w.e.f.
WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 9 29.08.1996 and he did not die in militant attack unlike

duly sanctioned. It is further submitted that the Death certificated and other related
documents pertaining to invalid pension were submitted to Dy. Secretary (Pension
Cell), government of Manipur Vide letter No. 42/INVP/96-SP-SPT dated 05.03.1997
of the Superintendent of Police, Senapati District. It is further submitted that all

submitted to the concerned authorities for further necessary action. However, Sr.
Accounts Officer (Pension) A.G. Manipur, Imphal vide letter No.
Pen/4-282(F)/IW/2007 dated 28.01.2015 intimated the Counsel of the petitioner
that Shri M. Suresh Sigh had rendered qualifying service of 8 (eight) years 9 (nine)
months and 12 days which is less than 10 (ten) years of qualifying service under Rule
49 (i) and 50 (i) (a) of M.C.S. (Pension) Rules 1977 as amended from time to time and

Manipur (Special Pension) Rules, 1982 which was in force before the introduction of

petitioner was informed that in the above facts and rule position, neither family
pension under Rule 54 of MCS (Pension) Rules, 1977 nor Special Pension under
Manipur Services (Special Pension) Rules, 1982 is applicable to the petitioner's
husband. The present petitioner has concealed this material facts of the information

Therefore, the present petition is liable to be dismissed for concealment of material
facts. It is pointed out that the death of the petitioner's husband was not caused by
the violence or wrongful acts of a person or persons believed to the members of an
extremist organization. Therefore, the entitlement of special pension to the petitioner
does not arise at the in view of Rule 4 (i) of the Manipur Service (special pension)
Rules 1982 as Ex. Constable No. 870007 M. Suresh Singh expired after being retired
from service. He was not in service when at the time of his death. Further, the
petitioner's husband had not served for more than 10 (ten) years of qualifying service
as stipulated under Rule 49 (i) and 50 (a) of M.C.S. (Pension) Rules 1977 as amended
from time to time.

Manipur Services(Special Pension), Rules 1982 to the Inspector General of
Police(Admn.) Manipur, Imphal. [16] Mr. Ch. Robinchandra, learned counsel for the
petitioner draws the attention of this Court to "The Manipur Services (Special
Pension) Rules, 1982". It is pointed out that the rules have been framed in order to
grant 'special pension' equivalent to the 'total emoluments' to employees of State
Govt, All India Services, Central Govt. on deputation, PSU, etc. who died in violence
by members of extremist organisation. It is submitted that the rule is a benevolent
legislation of compensating family members of employees died in militant action. As
per Rule 2(a), an employee of State government with 3 years of regular service who
died in such action, is entitled to special pension. Mr. Robinchandra reiterates that
the rules do not stipulate that the employee must die instantly in the militant action
and it is sufficient that the death must relate to militant's action. He has further
pointed out that the special pension under Rule 4(i) has to be granted upon a report
of the concerned District Magistrate to the effect that the death of the deceased
WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 16 government employee was caused by act of extremist
organisation. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that in the present case, the
husband of the petitioner worked more than three years as regular employee and as
per certificate of the District Magistrate, Senapati, the death was related to action by
an extremist organisation. It is also pointed out that the case of the petitioner does
not fall within the prohibited clauses as per Rule 8. Attention is drawn to letter dated
28.02.2015 [Annexure-A-8] sent by the Superintendent of Police Senapati to the
Inspector General of Police (Admn.), Manipur recommending the case of the
petitioner's husband for special pension. It is stated that respondent No. 4 cannot
retract from its stand in letter dated 28.02.2015 in the counter-affidavit and takes a
different stand altogether. Rule 4(ii) mandates that the certificate of the District
Magistrate is the conclusive proof that the employee died in militants' action. It is
prayed that writ petition be allowed and the respondents be directed to grant special
pension as per Rules of 1982 to the petitioner for death of her husband.
[17] Mr. H. Samarjit, learned Government Advocate has submitted that the Rules will
be applicable to the government employee who died in militant's action. In any case,
the death must relate to violence by extremist organisation. It is clarified that in the
present case, the husband of the WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 17 petitioner did not die
in as a result of ambush unlike other persons and he died due to some other disease
after retirement. Hence, his case will not fall within the purview of special pension as
per Rules of 1982. It is prayed that the writ petition be dismissed.
[18] This Court peruses the materials on record specially the rules and the report
submitted by District Magistrate and has considered the submissions made at bar.
[19] The object behind legislating "The Manipur Services (Special Pension) Rules,
1982" is to compensate for the loss to the family members of government employees
who died in militant action. The special pension is awarded for a sum equivalent to
the total emoluments. The requirement is a certificate from the concerned District
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111589468/ 8
Smt. Moirangthem (Ongbi) Ibetombi Devi vs The State Of Manipur Through The ... on 8 April, 2024
Magistrate to the effect that the death was due to violence by extremist organisation
and such certificate is the conclusive proof of the nature of death as contemplated in
Rule 4(ii). It is also stipulated by Rule 8 that the death was not due to suicide or self-
injury, the government employee was not a member of any unlawful organisation and
so as the claimant. It is also seen that the rule does not provide that the government
employee should die instantly in the attack by militant. It will be sufficed if the death
is relatable to any action by extremist WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 18 organisation. In
lines of these conditions, each and every case has to be examined for awarding special
pension.
[20] In the present case, the husband of the petitioner sustained injury in the attack
by Kuki militants where two police personnel died and others injured. Her husband
was discharged from service as invalid pension. He worked for more than three years
as a regular employee. He did not belong to any unlawful organisation and there are
no materials that the petitioners and her children are members of illegal
organisation. The District Magistrate, Senapati issued a certificate that the death of
the husband of the petitioner was due to the violence of extremist organisation. The
injury was not self-inflicted and it was not a case of suicide. Earlier, the respondent
No.4, ie, SP, Senapati was of the opinion in his letter dated 28.02.2015 that the death
by due to ambush by Kuki militants and the petitioner's was covered by the special
pension Rules of 1982. This Court is of the view that the respondent No.4 now cannot
plead in total contradiction to his earlier recommendation and does a complete
somersault. The respondents did not deny the certificate issued by the District
Magistrate, Senapati to the fact that the death was due to militant's attack. The
respondents cannot deny their own document.
WP(C)No.871 of 2017 Page 19
[21] Accordingly, it is held that the husband of the petitioner died as
a result of the ambush by Kuki militant within the meaning of "The Manipur Services
(Special Pension) Rules, 1982" and the family is entitled to 'special pension'
equivalent to 'total emoluments' as prescribed under Rule 4. The respondents are
