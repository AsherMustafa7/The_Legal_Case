Page |2 BEFORE HON'BLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE MR. MV MURALIDARAN 20.03.2023
[1] Heard Mr. Th. Mahira, learned counsel for the petitioners and perused the record.
[2] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Deputy AG takes notice for the State respondents.
[3] Mr. Mahira, learned counsel for the petitioners represented that pursuant to the Notification
dated 30.08.2013 the respondents are attempting to acquire the petitioners' land without due
process of law as laid down in "The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement Act, 2013". [4] Therefore, Mr. Mahira, learned
counsel for the petitioner is praying for setting aside of the Notification dated 30.08.2013. [5] Mr. H.
Debendra, learned Deputy AG represented that the Notification dated 30.08.2013 was issued as per
Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 but there is no attempt by the respondents for
acquisition of the petitioners' land and therefore, the writ petition itself is not maintainable on the
only ground that there is no document to show that the respondents are attempting to acquire the
petitioners' land. [6] As per the above Notification dated 30.08.2013, the names of petitioners are
shown at Sl. Nos. 5, 6 and 7 under the title "Schedule of Land for Expansion of Road Leading to
Marjing Polo/Pony Complex Page |3 at Heingang, Village No. 16-Heingang". Therefore, there is an
apprehension that the petitioners have filed this writ petition. [7] Mr. Debendra, the learned Deputy
AG represented that the Notification dated 30.08.2013 was issued as per Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 and as on date there is no proposal for acquisition of the petitioners' land.
[8] Anyhow, considering, the arguments advanced by both the parties, I am inclined to pass the
following orders :
a) this writ petition is disposed of.
b) if the respondents are attempting to acquire the
petitioners' land, they should do so by following due process of land as per the provisions of "The
Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation, and
Resettlement Act, 2013" and not under the provisions of "The Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
[9] With the above directions, this writ petition is disposed of.
