ORDER
This Criminal Revision Case has been filed challenging the judgment of the learned I Additional
District and Sessions Judge, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 Tiruppur,
dated 01.08.2017 passed in C.A.No.121 of 2016, confirming the judgment of the learned Judicial
Magistrate/Fast Track Court, Tiruppur, dated 18.10.2016 passed in C.C.No.262 of 2013.
2. This case has arisen out of a private complaint given by the respondent/complainant. The defacto
complainant is doing business in supplying hosiery yarns under the name and style of Mahilan
Yarns. The petitioner/1st accused is the proprietor of his business concern by name B.A.B Garments.
It is alleged that the petitioner/1st accused was having business transactions with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81451616/ 1
Paramasivam vs K.Satheeshkumar on 7 December, 2021
respondent/complainant and during that course, he had some dues payable to the respondent. In
order to discharge the dues, the petitioner/1st accused issued 3 cheques dated 05.09.2011,
06.09.2011 and 12.10.2011 drawn on City Union Bank, Tirupur, for the sums of Rs.2,52,000/-,
Rs.3,60,000/- and Rs.1,46,000/- respectively. All together the petitioner/1st accused had given 3
cheques for a total sum of Rs.7,58,000/-. When the respondent/complainant presented the cheque
for collection on 24.10.2011 and 29.10.2011, they were returned with an endorsement “payment
stopped by the drawer”. After issuing the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017
statutory pre-litigation notice and complying the legal mandates, the respondent/complainant has
filed the private complaint against the petitioner/1st accused to take action under Section 138 r/w
142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Since the 1st accused denied his involvement, trial was
conducted.
3. During the course of the trial, on the side of the respondent/complainant, three (3) witnesses
were examined as PWs.1 to 3 and fifteen (15) documents were marked as Exs.P1 to 15. On the side of
the petitioner/1st accused, one witness was examined as DW.1 and two (2) documents were marked
as Exs.D1 & 2.
4. After the conclusion of the trial and on considering the materials available on record, the learned
trial Judge found the accused guilty for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act, convicted and
sentenced him to undergo one year Simple Imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.1,000/-; in
default to undergo further Simple Imprisonment for a period of one month. Against the said
conviction, the petitioner/accused https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 has
filed an appeal in C.A.No.121 of 2016 before the learned I Additional District and Sessions Judge,
Tirupur, which was dismissed by confirming the judgment of the trial Court. Aggrieved over that,
this Criminal Revision Case has been filed by the petitioner/1st accused.
5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/1st accused and the learned counsel for the
respondent/complainant.
6. The learned counsel for the petitioner/1st accused submitted that the Courts below have failed to
appreciate the evidence in proper perspective and omitted to give the benefit of preponderance of
probability to the accused; the specific defence of the petitioner is that the defacto complainant, in
collusion with the 2nd accused who is the Manager of the 1st accused garments had misused the
cheques of the 1st accused for the purpose of filing this case; the 1st accused has given a criminal
complaint against the 2nd accused and the charge sheet has also been filed in that case.
7. The learned counsel for the respondent/complainant https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 submitted that once the execution of the cheque is admitted, the
presumption under Section 139 of N.I.Act goes in favour of the complainant, unless the contrary is
proved. He further submitted that the petitioner/accused did not rebut the initial presumption in
favour of the respondent/complainant and hence the judgment of the Courts below did not require
any interference.
8. Points for consideration:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81451616/ 2
Paramasivam vs K.Satheeshkumar on 7 December, 2021
Whether the finding and judgment of the lower appellate court suffer from any
unfairness, impropriety or illegality?
9. The fact that the petitioner/1st accused and the respondent/complainant are known to each other
is not denied. The petitioner/1st accused and the respondent/complainant have been in touch with
each other. During the said business dealing, the respondent/complainant is doing his business in
supplying yarn and it is his specific allegation that he had supplied the yarn to the petitioner's
garment also. In order to substantiate the above contention on the side of the
respondent/complainant Exs.P10 to 12 have been filed. However, the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 learned counsel for the petitioner/1st
accused submitted that with these records produced before this Court, the transaction amounting to
Rs.7,58,000/- as claimed by the respondent/complainant through the cheques were not proved and
the Courts have not appreciated the same.
10. Before venturing into the veracity of the business transaction, it is to be noted that once the
execution of the cheque is admitted by the drawer, an initial presumption has to be drawn that the
cheques were executed for discharging a legally enforceable debt or liability. However, the initial
presumption can be rebutted by the accused by producing any contrary evidence. It is not the case of
the petitioner/1 st accused that the complainant did not have any financial wherewithal to support
him with the business to the tune of Rs.7,58,000/-. His only contention is that the cheque belonging
to the petitioner was misused with the help of 2nd accused for the purpose of this case. It is seen
from the complaint Ex.D1, that the complaint has been given only against the 2nd accused and not
against the complainant. Neither the charge sheet has been filed against the complainant basing on
Ex.D1 complaint. In order to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 sustain
criminal action against the holder of the cheque for dishonour, it is sufficient to furnish prima facie
proof that can probabalise the transaction. And that itself will entitle the complainant to get the
benefit of initial presumption under sec.139 N.I.Act. The proof of liability for money as required in
civil suit for recovery of money is not needed in for the cases filed under sec.138 N.I.Act.
11. However the petitioner/1st accused has got the liberty to rebut the initial presumption by way of
exposing the improbabilities in the case of the complainant. With the production of Ex.D1 complaint
against the 2nd accused alone the 1st accused can not claim that he had defeated the case of the
complainant. The second accused is the own employee of the 1st accused. Some relevance has to be
established between Ex.D1 and the respondent/complaint. When the business transactions between
petitioner and the respondent were not denied, it is probable that the petitioner could have owed
money to the respondent.
12. The learned counsel for the petitioner/accused relied on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Basalingappa
-vs- Mudibasappa reported in 2019 (5) SCC 418 in support of his contention that even if the
petitioner/accused need not come to the witness box to prove the improbabilities and weaknesses in
the case of the complainant. In the said judgment, it is held as under:-

Paramasivam vs K.Satheeshkumar on 7 December, 2021
13. This Court in Bharat Barrel & Drum Mfg. Co. v. Amin Chand Payrelal [Bharat Barrel & Drum
Mfg. Co. v. Amin Chand Payrelal, (1999) 3 SCC 35] had occasion to consider Section 118(a) of the
Act. This Court held that once execution of the promissory note is admitted, the presumption under
Section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable
and defendant can prove the non-existence of a consideration by raising a probable defence. In para
12, the following has been laid down : (SCC pp. 50-51) “12. Upon consideration of various judgments
as noted hereinabove, the position of law which emerges is that once execution of the promissory
note is admitted, the presumption under Section 118(a) would arise that it is supported by a
consideration. Such a presumption is rebuttable. The defendant can prove the non-existence of a
consideration by raising a probable defence. If the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial
onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same
was illegal, the onus would shift to the plaintiff who will be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and
upon his failure to prove would disentitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable
instrument. The burden upon the defendant of proving the non-existence of the consideration can
be either direct or by bringing on record the preponderance of probabilities by reference to the
circumstances upon which he relies. In such an event, the plaintiff is entitled under law to rely upon
all the evidence led in the case including that of the plaintiff as well. In case, where the defendant
fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non- existence of the consideration, the
plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under Section 118(a)
in his favour. The court may not insist upon the defendant to disprove the existence of consideration
by leading direct evidence as the existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor contemplated
and even if led, is to be seen with a doubt. The bare denial of the passing of the consideration
apparently does not appear to be any defence. Something which is probable has to be brought on
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 record for getting the benefit of shifting
the onus of proving to the plaintiff. To disprove the presumption, the defendant has to bring on
record such facts and circumstances upon consideration of which the court may either believe that
the consideration did not exist or its non-existence was so probable that a prudent man would,
under the circumstances of the case, shall act upon the plea that it did not exist.”
14. S.B. Sinha, J. in M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala [M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of
Kerala, (2006) 6 SCC 39 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] had considered Sections 118(a), 138 and 139 of the
Act, 1881. It was held that presumptions both under Sections 118(a) and 139 are rebuttable in
nature. Explaining the expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” referring to an earlier
judgment, the following was held in para 28 : (SCC p.
49) “28. What would be the effect of the expressions “may presume”, “shall presume” and
“conclusive proof” has been considered by this Court in Union of India v. Pramod Gupta [Union of
India v. Pramod Gupta, (2005) 12 SCC 1] , in the following terms : (SCC pp. 30-31, para 52) ‘52.…It
is true that the legislature used two different phraseologies “shall be presumed” and “may be
presumed” in Section 42 of the Punjab Land Revenue Act and furthermore although provided for
the mode and manner of rebuttal of such presumption as regards the right to mines and minerals
said to be vested in the Government vis-à-vis the absence thereof in relation to the lands presumed
to be retained by the landowners but the same would not mean that the words “shall presume”
would be conclusive. The meaning of the expressions “may presume” and “shall presume” have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81451616/ 4
Paramasivam vs K.Satheeshkumar on 7 December, 2021
explained in Section 4 of the Evidence Act, 1872, from a perusal whereof it would be evident that
whenever it is directed that the court shall presume a fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless
disproved. In terms of the said provision, thus, the expression “shall presume” cannot be held to be
synonymous with “conclusive proof”.’ ”
15. It was noted in M.S. Narayana Menon case [M.S. Narayana Menon v. State of Kerala, (2006) 6
SCC 39 : (2006) 3 SCC (Cri) 30] , that the expression “shall presume” cannot be held to be
synonymous with conclusive proof. Referring to definition of words “proved” and “disproved” under
Section 3 of the Evidence Act, 1872 the following was laid down in para 30 : (SCC p. 50) “30.
Applying the said definitions of “proved” or “disproved” to the principle behind Section 118(a) of the
Act, the court shall presume a negotiable instrument to be for consideration unless and until after
considering the matter before it, it either believes that the consideration does not exist or considers
the non-existence of the consideration so probable that a prudent man ought, under the
circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that the consideration does not
exist. For rebutting such https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017 presumption,
what is needed is to raise a probable defence. Even for the said purpose, the evidence adduced on
behalf of the complainant could be relied upon.” .......
.......
20. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan [Rangappa v. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11
SCC 441 : (2010) 4 SCC (Civ) 477 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 184] had occasion to elaborately consider the
provisions of Sections 138 and 139. In the above case, the trial court had acquitted the accused in a
case relating to dishonour of cheque under Section
138. The High Court had reversed [Mohan v. Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 783] the judgment of
the trial court convicting the accused. In the above case, the accused had admitted signatures on the
cheque. This Court held that where the fact of signature on the cheque is acknowledged, a
presumption has to be raised that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt or liability,
however, this presumption is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on the accused to raise a
probable defence. In para 13, the following has been laid down : (SCC p. 446) “13. The High Court in
its order [Mohan v. Rangappa, 2005 SCC OnLine Kar 783] noted that in the course of the trial
proceedings, the accused had admitted that the signature on the impugned cheque (No. 0886322
dated 8-2- 2001) was indeed his own. Once this fact has been acknowledged, Section 139 of the Act
mandates a presumption that the cheque pertained to a legally enforceable debt or liability. This
presumption is of a rebuttal nature and the onus is then on the accused to raise a probable defence.
With regard to the present facts, the High Court found that the defence raised by the accused was
not probable.”
13. There is no disagreement on the point that the first accused has got the liberty to protect
improbabilities in the case of the respondent/complainant and get the benefit of rebuttal proof. But
here is a case where the relationship between the petitioner and the respondent is not denied and
even the material evidences are produced to show that the petitioner and the respondent have been
doing business transactions for a https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Crl.R.C.No1247 of 2017
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81451616/ 5
Paramasivam vs K.Satheeshkumar on 7 December, 2021
considerable length of time. The Courts below have appreciated the position of law with regard to
initial presumption in correct perspective and found the accused guilty on the basis of material
available before the court. Hence I find no reason for interference.
14. In the result, this Criminal Revision Case stands dismissed. The judgment of the Judicial
Magistrate/Fast Track Court, Tiruppur, dated 18.10.2016 passed in C.C.No.262 of 2013 is
confirmed. The trial Court is directed to issue Non Bailable Warrant for securing the accused and
sending him to prison for undergoing the sentence.
