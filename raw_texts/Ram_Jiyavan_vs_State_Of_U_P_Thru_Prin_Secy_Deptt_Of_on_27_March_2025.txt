and properly applying his judicial mind, the learned Additional Chief Judicial
Magistrate-II, Gonda passing the impugned order summoned the innocent applicant
for facing trail under section 406, 420, 467, 468, 471, 504, 506 IPC (contained as
ANNEXURE NO. 1 & 2) with the affidavit filed in support of this application.
It is further prayed that this Hon'ble Court, may kindly be pleased to stay the
proceeding of above noted case which is going on against the applicant before the
learned Court below, during pendency of instant application in the interest of
justice."
3. This Court has issued notice to the respondent nos. 2 and 3, which was served upon them, as
mentioned in the order dated 30.1.2025. The order dated 30.01.2025 is being reproduced
hereinbelow:-
"In pursuance to earlier order of this Court dated 17.12.2024, applicant is personally
present and has been duly identified by his counsel.
Service of notice upon opposite party Nos.2 and 3 is sufficient as appears from office
report dated 29.01.2025. However, no one is present on behalf of opposite party
Nos.2 and 3, when the case is called out.
Taking note of the facts of the case and in the interest of justice, the case is
adjourned.
List/ put up this case on 27.03.2025 for presence of parties.
Interim order dated 17.12.2024 shall continue till the next date of listing."
4. Today, the position is the same as neither respondent nos. 2 and 3 nor any counsel on their behalf
has filed any vakalatnama or present before this Court.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that an FIR on 20.01.2022 was lodged under
Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 471, 504 and 506 IPC by the respondent no. 2. In the said case, the
charge-sheet was filed against the applicant and in pursuance thereof, the Court concerned has
taken cognizance and issued summoning order dated 03.01.2023 without considering the fact that
the Section 406 of IPC and 420 IPC cannot go in the same breath hence, the order has been passed
without application of mind and in support of his submissions, learned counsel for the applicant
relied upon the judgment rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Delhi Race Club (1940)
Ltd. and others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and another reported in 2024 10 SCC 690. The relevant
portion of the said judgment is being reproduced hereinbelow:-
"38. In our view, the plain reading of the complaint fails to spell out any of the
aforesaid ingredients noted above. We may only say, with a view to clear a serious
misconception of law in the mind of the police as well as the courts below, that if it is

Ram Jiyavan vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt. Of ... on 27 March, 2025
a case of the complainant that offence of criminal breach of trust as defined under
Section 405IPC, punishable under Section 406 IPC, is committed by the accused,
then in the same breath it cannot be said that the accused has also committed the
offence of cheating as defined and explained in Section 415IPC, punishable under
Section 420IPC.
41. The distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of criminal
breach of trust and cheating is a fine one. In case of cheating, the intention of the
accused at the time of inducement should be looked into which may be judged by a
subsequent conduct, but for this, the subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere
breach of contract cannot give rise to a criminal prosecution for cheating unless
fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right from the beginning of the
transaction i.e. the time when the offence is said to have been committed. Therefore,
it is this intention, which is the gist of the offence.
43. There is a distinction between criminal breach of trust and cheating. For cheating,
criminal intention is necessary at the time of making a false or misleading
representation i.e. since inception. In criminal breach of trust, mere proof of
entrustment is sufficient. Thus, in case of criminal breach of trust, the offender is
lawfully entrusted with the property, and he dishonestly misappropriated the same.
Whereas, in case of cheating, the offender fraudulently or dishonestly induces a
person by deceiving him to deliver any property. In such a situation, both the
offences cannot co-exist simultaneously.
55. It is high time that the police officers across the country are imparted proper
training in law so as to understand the fine distinction between the offence of
cheating vis--vis criminal breach of trust. Both offences are independent and distinct.
The two offences cannot coexist simultaneously in the same set of facts. They are
antithetical to each other. The two provisions of IPC (now BNS, 2023) are not twins
that they cannot survive without each other."
6. Learned A.G.A. has vehemently opposed the application but unable to dispute the settled
proposition of law as relied upon by the learned counsel for the applicant i.e. the Section 406 IPC
and Section 420 IPC cannot be proceeded with simultaneously and the Court concerned must apply
its mind before taking cognizance and issuing summoning order as to which section is attracted
from either of the two.
7. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, going through the record of the case and judgment
in the case of Delhi Race Club (supra) as well, it is apparent from the cognizance and summoning
order that the Court concerned has taken cognizance and issued summons against the applicant in
both the Sections i.e. 406 and 420 IPC alongwith other sections whereas Section 406 IPC and
Section 420 IPC cannot go in same breath so before taking the cognizance and issuing summons
against the applicants, the Court concerned must have determined as to which section is made out
against the applicant.

8. In view of the facts, circumstances and observations made hereinabove, the impugned
summoning order dated 03.01.2023 and cognizance order dated 20.01.2022 are hereby quashed.
9. The present case is allowed.
10. The case is remitted to the court concerned to take cognizance in the matter afresh after going
through the material available before it and keeping in mind the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Delhi Race Club (supra).
