1. The petitioner, through this CRLREV, has challenged the order dated 21.03.2017 passed by the

Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 I. FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE:

3. During course of investigation, with regards to G.R. Case No.1343 of 2015, on 14.08.2015 the
statement of the informant victim/Opposite Party No.2 was recorded under Section 164 of the
Cr.P.C. In her statement though the Opposite Party No.2 revealed some new fact with respect to the
investigation, the Investigating Officer instead of changing the course of investigation on the basis of
the said fact revealed by the informant, preferred to accept a further written statement, which goes
in line with the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. before the Magistrate and treated the
same as a new F.I.R. instead of C.I.D. C.B. P.S. Case No.19 of 2015. The case of the petitioner is that
the same is not acceptable in the eye of law.
II. PETITIONER'S SUBMISSIONS:
4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner(s) earnestly made the following submissions in support of his
contentions:
5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that on 07.08.2015 one written complaint was
presented at Mangalabag Police Station under the signature of the Opposite Party No.2.
Subsequently, Mangalabag Police Station Case No.164 of 2015 was instituted, however, taking into
account the sensitivity of the case, the said Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary
Reason: Authentication Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04
case was transferred to C.I.D. C.B., Cuttack, Police Station on 08.08.2015 and was, accordingly,
renumbered as C.I.D., C.B., P.S. Case No.18 of 2015. While the investigation was in progress, the
statement of the Opposite Party No.2 was also recorded before the learned J.M.F.C, Cuttack on
14.08.2015.
6. It is further contended that the Opposite Party No.2 in her statement recorded under Section 164
of Cr.P.C disowned the contention made in the first written complaint rather she complained
therein that instead of the persons named in the F.I.R. made on 07.08.2015 she had actually been
intimidated by one Sarathi Baba.
7. After recording of the statement before the learned Magistrate by the Opposite Party No.2 on the
very said night of 14.08.2015 at about 10.30pm, the Opposite Party No.2 presented another written
complaint in line with her 164 statement, which was taken as a fresh F.I.R and registered as C.I.D.,
C.B. Cuttack P.S. Case No.19 of 2015
8. Learned counsel for the Petitioner further submits that even though the very 1st F.I.R. was
pending before the learned C.I.D, C.B., Cuttack, instead of pursuing the same as the subject matter
of both the F.I.R is pending with regard to intimidation to the complaint therein the Opposite Party
No.2, the I.O. of the 1st case i.e. the C.I.D, C.B Cuttack P.S. No.18 of 2015 registered as G.R. Case
No.1341 of 2015 preferred to lie low and the investigating Officer of C.I.D, C.B, Cuttack P.S. No.19 of
2015 registered as G.R. Case No.1373 of 2015 proceeded with the investigation entrusted to her and
submitted Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 charge sheet on 28.11.2015 for
commission of offence against the Petitioner and others, whereas on 11.12.2015 the 1st F.I.R, which
was registered as C.I.D., C.B., Cuttack P.S. Case No.18 of 2015, was closed and a final form was

Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati vs State Of Orissa & Anr. .... Opposite ... on 8 February, 2024
submitted.
9. The 2nd F.I.R. after being charge sheeted and placed before the learned court of the Special Judge
S.C & S.T. (P.O.A) Act as Section 3(2)(v)(vi) was added besides the offences under the different
sections of the I.P.C in the Charge sheet.
10. He further contends that if the subject matter of 1st FIR and the complainant's Section 164
statement is taken into account conjointly, the only allegation brought out against the Petitioner
would be she influenced the Opposite Party No.2 to seek protection from the Police stating that
some people were intend to cause harm to her and besides this none alleged anything against the
Petitioner to have committed any other overact.
11. After a lot of legal wrangles, the learned court below finally took cognizance of offence under
Section 120 (B), 506 read with Section 34 of the I.P.C against the Petitioner. The Petitioner then
filed a petition to discharge her from the case as cognizance of offence against her on the basis of the
2nd complaint is not tenable under law, but the learned court below refused to entertain the same.
12. It is well settled by the Apex Court as well as the High Court that once F.I.R. has been lodged in
the Police Station for commission of any offence on a particular fact and aspect, no 2nd F.I.R would
be Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication Location:
ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 entertainable on the self-same
facts and circumstance even if new facts comes out during course of investigation.
13. In both the complaints registered with the Police, the crux of the allegation is criminal
intimidation to the complainant of both the cases the present Opposite Party No.2 and in that view
of the matter the 2nd F.I.R should have been treated as a further statement of the Opposite Party
No.2 but should not have been taken up as an independent F.I.R.
14. He further relies on the principle settled by the Apex Court in the case of T.T. Antony v. State of
Kerla and Ors.1, Amit Bhai Anilchandra Shah v. C.B.I.2 and one of this Court in the case of Dillip
Kumar RathaVrs. State of Orissa : 2022 Vol-86 O.C.R.
15. He further submits that the impugned order passed by the learned court below is bad in law as
while passing the said order the learned Court failed to apply his judicial mind to the points raised
before him, for which without delving into the material available in the record, the learned court
below passed the order in a mechanical manner, which needs to be reconsidered.
16. The learned Courts while passing the order impugned failed to take note of the fact that though
the charge sheet makes out an offence under Section 384 of the I.P.C., and initially taken cognizance
of the learned S.D.J.M. which has been turned down by this Court while disposing of the Criminal
Revision No. 491/2016 along with criminal Revision No.593/2016 holding that this Petitioner has

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149259041/ 3
Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati vs State Of Orissa & Anr. .... Opposite ... on 8 February, 2024
prescription of law as the alleged act of the Petitioner has not caused any alarm in the mind of the
Petitioner that the victim informant thereby suspected to suffer any injury by herself on that the
victim informant has been forced not to do any act which she is legally entitled to do and thereby
made the order unacceptable which requires to be reconsidered.
17. Leaned court below erred in law in accepting the police case placed before him instead of sending
it back as the very case before him is not maintainable as per the principle settled by the Apex Court
as the chargesheet, which is the basis of the case pending before the learned Court has no legal
sanctity to be regarded as an independent piece of document which can bring into motion a new
case.
III. COURT'S REASONING AND ANALYSIS:
18. Learned counsel for the petitioner-accused has submitted that the present case arising out of GR
1373 of 2015 of the court of SDJM(S), Cuttack corresponding, to CID CB P.S. case No.19 of 2015 is
only an outcome of GR 1343 of 2015 of the said court corresponding to CID CB P.S. case No.18 of
2015, but two different cases have been instituted by the prosecu on which is against the principle of
law.
19. In this regard, he has pointed out that, when the final report submitted in GR. 1343 of 2015 is yet
to be accepted by the learned SDJM(S), Cuttack, the proceedings of the present case are not
permissible. He has further contended that the FIR in the present Designation: Assistant
Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT,
CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 case being only a statement of the informant during
investigation of GR.1343 of 2015 is only a statement u/s.162 of Cr.P.C. and cannot be termed an FIR.
Further, stressing on the point that there is absolutely no prima facie evidence against the petitioner
accused with regard to the alleged criminal conspiracy and criminal intimidation, the learned
counsel has contended that the petitioner accused had only assisted the informant in lodging the
FIR only for her safety.
20. On perusal of the materials on record such as the FIR and the statements u/s.161 Cr.P.C. of
informant Rosalin Mallick, her parents Bhagabat Mallick and Manorama Das and her friend Smruti
Prajna Sanhita, it is revealed that on 7.8.2015 in between 2 to 3:30 pm, the petitioner accused Mili
@ Subhalaxmi Pati had made a call to the mobile phone of Smruti Prajna Sanhita and talked with
Rosalin Mallick asking her to talk with accused Manjulata Swain @ CBI Madam and intimating her
at the same time that her life was in danger and her hostel authority had been paid eighteen lakh
rupees to kill her.
21. The aforesaid materials also disclose that the petitioner accused had also told Rosalin Mallick
that four employees of Sarathi Ashram namely Nandi, Khageswar Rout, Kailash Mallick and Fishore
Mallick were waiting to kill her. The aforesaid materials further disclose that after Rosalin Mallick
wrote the FIR as per the dictation of a higher level Investigating Officer.

HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04
22. Besides the aforesaid materials, the statement u/s.161 of Cr.P.C. of witness Surendra Mallick
reveals that on 4.8.2015 at about 6 p.m. Manjulata Swain came to the Ashram of Sarathi Baba and
the latter asked her to go with petitioner accused Mili to Rosalin Mallick and to lodge an FIR
through her against Khaga, Kailash, Kishore & Nandi either by persuasion or by threat with the
allegation that the aforesaid four persons had compelled her to take him (Sarathi Baba) to
Hyderabad and that she out of her own volition had taken him there. It is also disclosed from the
statement of Surendra Mallick that accused Sarathi Baba had also talked with the petitioner accused
Mili over mobile phone of the accused Manjulata and told the same thing to her and then Manjulata
had told him not to worry assuring him that henceforth she and Mili would do needful in the matter.
23. It is well settled legal position that at the stage of framing charge for an offence against an
accused only prima facie case has to be seen whether sufficient grounds are available on record to
proceed against him and even strong suspicion is enough to frame charge(s) and at this stage of the
proceedings evidence is not required to be analyzed, as it is required to be done at the final stage
after trial.
24. In Sheoraj Singh Ahlawat v. State of U.P.3, the Apex Court held as follows:-
"While framing charges/ court is required to evaluate materials and documents on
record to decide whether facts emerging therefrom taken at (2013) 11 SCC 476
Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 their face
value would disclose existence of ingredients constituting the alleged offence. At this
stage, the court is not required to go deep into the probative value of materials on
record. It needs to evaluate whether there is a ground for presuming that accused had
committed an offence. But it should not evaluate sufficiency of evidence to convict
accused. Even if there is a grave suspicion against the accused and it is not properly
explained or court feels that accused might have committed offence, then framing of
charges against the accused is justified. It is only for conviction of accused that
materials must indicate that accused had committed offence but for framing of
charges if materials indicate that accused might have committed offence, then
framing of charge is proper. Materials brought on by prosecution must be believed to
be true and their probative value cannot be decided at this stage.
The court should not act as mouthpiece of prosecution and it is impermissible to have roving
enquiry at the stage of framing of charge."
25. The Apex Court in State of Rajasthan v. Fatehkaran Mehdu4 while dealing with the scope of
interference under Section 397 Cr.P.C when the charges had been framed, held:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/149259041/ 5
Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati vs State Of Orissa & Anr. .... Opposite ... on 8 February, 2024
"The scope of interference under Section 397 Code of Criminal Procedure at a stage,
when charge had been framed, is also well settled. At the stage of framing of a charge,
the court is concerned not with the proof of the allegation rather it has to focus on the
material and form an opinion whether there is strong suspicion that the Accused has
committed an offence, which if put to trial, could prove his guilt. The framing of
charge is not a stage, at which stage final test of guilt is to be applied. Thus, to hold
that at the stage of framing the charge, the court should AIR 2017 SC 796.
Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication
Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 form an
opinion that the Accused is certainly guilty of committing an offence, is to hold
something which is neither permissible nor is in consonance with scheme of Code of
Criminal Procedure."
26. Additionally, quashing of a charge is an exception to the Rule of continuous prosecution. Where
the offence is even broadly satisfied, the Court should be more inclined to permit continuation of
prosecution rather than its quashing at that initial stage.
27. Thus, it is well settled legal position that at the stage of framing charge(s) for an offence against
an accused only prima facie facts have to be seen whether sufficient grounds are available on record
to proceed against him and even strong suspicion is enough to frame charge and at this stage of the
proceedings evidence is not required to be analyzed, as it is required to be done at the final stage
after trial. It is also well settled that at this stage of the proceedings only the charge-sheet and
evidence collected during investigation which has been produced alongwith the charge-sheet is
required to be considered.
28. From the aforesaid materials it is prima facie clear that accused persons Sarathi Baba @ Santosh
Kumar Roul, CBI Madam@ 3. Manjulata Swain & Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati had an agreement
amongst themselves to do an illegal act by intimidating Rosalin Mallick and causing a false FIR
lodged through her against four innocent persons with the allegation that they had threatened to kill
her. To execute this agreement, the petitioner accused caused alarm in the mind of Rosalin Mallick
by talking to her over the mobile phone of her friend that she would be killed by Nandi, Khageswar
Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason: Authentication Location: ORISSA
HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 Rout, Kailash Mallick & Kishore Mallick. It
is then on the suggestion of the petitioner accused, Rosalin Mallick talked with accused Manjulata
Swain @ CBI Madam over phone and as per her dictation, she wrote the false FIR against the
aforesaid four persons which was ultimately presented at Mangalabag P.S. and Mangalabag P.S.
case No.164 of 2015 dated 7.8.2015 was registered.
29. Thus, the aforesaid facts clearly make out a prima facie case under Sections 506,120-B/34 IPC
against the petitioner accused Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati and this has also been held by this Court vide
order dated 24.10.2016 in Crl.Revn.No.593 of 2016 while deciding the order dated 31.5.2016 of the
learned SDJM(S), Cuttack taking cognizance of the offences in this case.

Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati vs State Of Orissa & Anr. .... Opposite ... on 8 February, 2024
30. However, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner accused is not correct in view
of the fact that the statement of informant Rosalin Mallick /s.161 of Cr.P.C. in GR. 1343 of 2015
corresponding to CID CB P.S. case No.18 of 2015 was already recorded on 7.8.2015 by the IIC,
Mahila P.S., Cuttack and also because the incidents of the said case and the present case are
different though they relate to each other. As mentioned by informant Rosalin Mallick in her present
FIR dated 14.8.2015, the writing which she had made on 7.8.2015 as per the dictation of accused
Manjulata Swain @ CBI Madam and which was subsequently presented at the Mangalabag P.S. was
not even known to be an FIR to her till she was examined by the IIC, Mangalabag P.S. on it. On the
contrary, the FIR of the present case Designation: Assistant Registrar-cum-Senior Secretary Reason:
Authentication Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK Date: 04-Mar-2024 18:29:04 was
lodged by her after she came to know that petitioner accused Mili @ Subhalaxmi Pati and accused
Manjulata Swain @ CBI Madam had made her to write a false report against four innocent persons
and then caused it to be registered as FIR at Mangalabag P.S. In the present FIR Rosalin Mallick
had also alleged against accused Sarathi Baba @ Santosh Kumar Roul that he continued to subject
her to criminal intimidation by issuing threat to cause her death and to spoil her family members.
31. For these reasons, this Court is of the view that the present FIR is not an information or
statement made during the course of investigation in CID CB P.S. case No.18 of 2015 and hence is
not a statement under Section l62 of the Cr.P.C. For the aforesaid reasons, the decisions of the
Supreme Court relied on by the counsel for the petitioner accused is not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case. It is also to be held that even if the final report submitted in
GR.1343 of 2015 has not yet been accepted, the continuance of the present case is not illegal and is
not dependant on the court's order in the said case.
32. With respect to the aforesaid discussion, this Court is not inclined to entertain the prayer of the
petitioner.
33. Accordingly, this CRLREV is dismissed.
