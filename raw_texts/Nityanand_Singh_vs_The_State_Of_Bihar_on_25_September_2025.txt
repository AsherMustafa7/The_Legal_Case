5. Once again in the year 2023, one another complaint was made before the District Public

fraud, however no documents have been furnished to substantiate such allegation and finally this
proceeding also came to be dropped vide letter no. 1920 dated 10.08.2023. Notwithstanding the

Nityanand Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
31.07.2025 came to be passed under the joint signature of Mukhiya and Panchayat Secretary and the
services of the petitioner has been terminated. The show cause notice as well as the impugned order
of termination are put to challenge by filing interlocutory applications.
7. Mr. Rajendra Narayan, learned Senior Advocate Patna High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 representing the petitioner while assailing the impugned orders submitted that the
very initiation of the proceeding and the impugned order of termination passed at the behest of the
order of the Additional Collector (Disaster Management), Bhagalpur is wholly without jurisdiction
as the Additional Collector (Disaster Management), Bhagalpur has neither the appointing or
disciplinary authority of the petitioner nor empowered under the Bihar Panchayat Teacher
Appointment Service and Condition Rules, 2006 and the Rules amended from time to time. The
facts are admitted to the extent, the petitioner was duly appointed as a Panchayat Teacher long back
in the year 2014 in pursuant to the District Appellate Authority under Memo No. 31 dated
12.12.2014, since then the petitioner has been discharging his duties. The so called complainant is
neither in existence nor any complaint/documents has been handed over to the petitioner, based
upon which the so called enquiry was conducted. It is further submitted that after coming into force
of Bihar School Exclusive Teachers Rules, 2023 the petitioner appeared in the Competency Test and
on being successfully passed the Competency Test, necessary order has been issued and the
petitioner was duly converted as Exclusive Teacher; hence any proceeding which has been initiated
against the petitioner must Patna High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 be proceeded
in accordance with the Bihar School Exclusive Teachers Rules, 2023.
8. Referring to the proviso to Rule 3 of the Bihar School Exclusive Teachers Rules, 2023, it is
submitted that there is a specific stipulation that these Exclusive Teachers upon passing the
Competency Test under Rule 4, will be entitled to avail the salary and other perks entitled to the
school teachers appointed under the Bihar State School Teachers (Appointment), Transfer,
Disciplinary Proceeding and Service Condition Rule, 2023. It is further provided that any
disciplinary action, vigilance, enquiry or any other investigation pending against such local bodies
teachers, who became Exclusive Teacher, shall continue as per the provision of these Rules.
9. Further, taking this Court through the Bihar State School Teachers (Appointment), Transfer,
Disciplinary Proceeding and Service Condition Rule, 2023, specially Rule 14 thereof, learned Senior
Advocate contended that there is no iota of confusion that the provision contained in Bihar
Government Servant (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 2005 as amended from time to time
shall be applicable to the school teacher appointed under these Rules. Hence, in no circumstances,
the impugned order of punishment inflicted by Patna High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024
dt.25-09-2025 the Mukhiya and the Panchayat Secretary of the Panchayat concerned, is sustainable
in law.
10. Learned Advocate for the State referring to the counter affidavit submitted that upon receipt of
the complaint in the office of the District Magistrate, Bhagalpur with respect of illegal appointment
of some of the Panchayat Teacher, an enquiry was conducted and it has been found that the
appointment of the instant petitioner has been made on wrong roster, because the post which has
been occupied by the instant petitioner, is meant for EBC, whereas the petitioner belongs to BC-2,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/5570998/ 3
Nityanand Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
hence his appointment cannot be possible on the said post, even on any direction as has been given
by the District Appellate Authority.
11. This Court has given anxious consideration to the submissions advanced by learned Advocate for
the respective parties and also perused the materials available on record. Since the issue raised
before this Court is confined to the legality of the order, this Court without touching into the facts of
the case, thinks it apt and proper to proceed further.
12. From the materials available on record, specially the submissions made by learned Senior
Advocate, it is admitted that the very appointment of the petitioner was made in pursuant Patna
High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025 to the order of the District Appellate Authority
and till date, the order of the District Appellate Authority is neither amended, modified nor turned
down by any Appellate Authority. An order, even if it is bad or illegal, unless it is turned down by the
superior Court, it still holds the field good and thus cannot be ignored and overlooked in such a
casual manner.
13. This Court further finds substance in the submission that once the petitioner has been converted
as an Exclusive Teacher, the service condition of the petitioner shall be governed with the Bihar
School Exclusive Teachers Rule, 2023. The aforesaid fact has not been confronted by the respondent
that the petitioner has not passed the Competency Test, however, learned Advocate for the State
submits that there is no order with respect to the appointment of the petitioner as Exclusive
Teacher.
14. The submission of the learned Advocate for the State has no relevance as the Bihar School
Exclusive Teachers Rule, 2023 clearly stipulates that the date on which a local body teacher shall
pass the Competency Test, they shall be treated as an Exclusive Teacher. Moreover, initiation of the
departmental proceeding and/or the enquiry conducted by the Additional Collector (Disaster
Management) Bhagalpur who have no Patna High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025
authority under the law even with respect to local bodies teachers, like Panchayat/Prakhand
Teachers or Exclusive Teachers, any enquiry conducted by him is wholly without jursidiction. The
enquiry further vitiated, when the copy of the same has not been handed over to the petitioner,
alongwith the show cause notice. This Court also find that once the petitioner has been converted as
an Exclusive Teacher, the Mukhiya and the Panchayat Secretary of the concerned Panchayat has no
jurisdiction to pass the impugned order of termination against the petitioner, who is now an
Exclusive Teacher and thus he shall only be subjected to Bihar Government Servant (Classification,
Control & Appeal) Rules, 2005, in terms with Rule 14 of the Bihar state School teachers
(Appointment) Transfer, Disciplinary Proceeding and Service Condition Rules, 2023.
15. On all these grounds, both the impugned orders as contained in Memo No. 2820/C Bhagalpur
dated 24.09.2024 as well as the order contained in Memo No. 69 dated 31.07.2025 qua the
petitioner are hereby set aside, the consequences shall follow, with his reinstatement and other
benefits.

16. The matter is hereby relegated to the concerned authority to proceed in accordance with law, if
so intended, in accordance with law.
Patna High Court CWJC No.16310 of 2024 dt.25-09-2025
17. The writ petition stands allowed.
