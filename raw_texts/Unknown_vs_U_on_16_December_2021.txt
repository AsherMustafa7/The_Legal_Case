3.The case of the prosecution, in brief, is as follows:
(i) The appellant is the resident of Munusami Kotai, Palacode Taluk..
The deceased Muniyappan is the father of the appellant. The appellant was working as a Cleaner in
lorry. He got addicted to liquor and he used to quarrel in the family in order to harass them, due to
which, the mother Pachaiyammal and the brother of the appellant Devraj had left the home and they
were doing Coolie work. The deceased was living alone in the house with the appellant. The
appellant used to have wordy quarrel with his father https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and harass
him, whenever the appellant returned home.
(ii) On 31.12.2014, after the completion of his work, the appellant came back to his home at around
8.30 p.m. and burst crackers in front of his house. At that time, the deceased Muniyappan had
warned him not to burst the crackers in front of his house, due to which, there was a quarrel
between them and during the quarrel, due to sudden provocation, the appellant had taken up a
Neem Stick and attacked his father Muniyappan on his head, face and hands. Thereafter, the
deceased Muniyappan ran over to the field of one Sadhasivam. Later, the deceased succumbed to

Unknown vs U on 16 December, 2021
(iv) Based on the complaint given by PW1, on the next day on 01.01.2015 at 12.45 a.m, PW12 Sub
Inspector of Police registered an F.I.R- Ex.P12 in Crime No.2 of 2015 under Section 302 of I.P.C and
he had sent the original F.I.R to the Judicial Magistrate and the copies to the higher officials.
(v) PW13, Inspector of Police took up the investigation and during the course of investigation, he
proceeded to the scene of occurrence at 14.13 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis hrs and in the
presence of one Vadivel and PW8 Raja, had prepared an Observation Mahazar-Ex.P9 and Rough
Sketch-Ex.P14. Thereafter, he had conducted inquest in the presence of panchayathars and handed
over the body to PW11 Head Constable along with the requisition letter-Ex.P16 and sent the body for
autopsy .
(vi) PW10, the Doctor, on receipt of requisition letter, Ex.P16 had conducted the autopsy and issued
post mortem certificate Ex.PP10 opining that the deceased would appear to have died of heady
injury.
(vii) Thereafter, PW13 had examined the witness and recorded their submissions. On information,
he had arrested the accused at Palacode. The accused had voluntarily confessed and based on his
confession, Neem Stick (M.O) was recovered and thereafter, the accused was remanded and sent to
judicial custody. Subsequently, PW13 has examined the other witnesses and sent the internal organs
for chemical analysis. The Viscera Report is Ex.P11. Thereafter, PW13 gave request to the Magistrate
and recorded the submissions from the witnesses under Section 164 Cr.P.C. On 27.03.2015, he had
examined PW7 and PW11 and on the same day, he had also examined PW10 Doctor, who conducted
the Autopsy. On 27.03.2015, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis PW13 had filed the final report
before the Judicial Magistrate, Palacode for the offence under Section 302 IPC against the accused.
(viii) The case was taken up in P.R.C.No.7 of 2015 and after furnishing copies under Section 207
Cr.P.C, the case was taken up in S.C.No.45 of 2015. The Trial Judge, after perusing the records,
framed charges against the accused under Section 302 I.P.C. When the accused were question, he
had denied the charges and sought to be tried.
(ix) The Trial Court, having found the accused guilty for the offence under Section 304(2) of IPC and
convicted and sentenced him as stated above, aggrieved against which, the present Appeal has been
filed by the accused.
4. The sum and substance of the submissions made by the counsel appearing for the appellant is as
under:
(i) It is the case of patricide, even as per the prosecution, the alleged occurrence is
said to have taken place during night hours and in a quarrel between the appellant
and his father. It is the case of the prosecution that the appellant was in an inebriated
condition and that when he had burst crackers in front of his house, his father had
scolded him not to burst the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis crackers in front of his
house and a quarrel arose between them, during which, the appellant is said to have
taken a Neem Stick and assaulted his father, due to which, his father had sustained
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143979127/ 3
Unknown vs U on 16 December, 2021
injuries and ran over the field of Sadhasivam and on the next day, he was found dead
on the field.
(ii) The incident had taken place in front of the appellant's house in the village where
the other houses were also there, however, nobody has given complaint against the
appellant. Even PW2, who is the brother of the appellant, had not given a complaint
and the other villagers have also not given a complaint. Though the close relatives
had been examined as witnesses, it is strange that none of them took initiation to give
a complaint to the police, however, the Trial Court, without taking into consideration,
had convicted the accused.
(iii) Though several witnesses have spoken as if they had seen the quarrel between
the father and the son, none of them had given complaint and it was given only by the
Village Administrative Officer, who had found the body of the deceased lying in a
corn field. The Village Administrative Officer, who is not a witness to the occurrence
and even the quarrel, a hearsay witness, has given a complaint as if the death of the
victim was on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis account of an assault by the
appellant. Though several witnesses have been examined by the prosecution to show
that they had witnessed the quarrel between the accused and the deceased, none of
them had given any information or intimation with regard to the same. There are
several anomalies and infirmities in this case.
(iv) There are several other lacunae in this case. The appellant is an unmarried young
man, aged about 29 years at the time of occurrence. Even as per the prosecution, he
was in an inebriated condition and the incident had happened during the quarrel
between the appellant and father. The appellant had no intention to murder his
father. Right from 11.12.2015, the appellant is in custody and he had undergone
almost 6 years of sentence and the Superintendent of Central Prison, Vellore had also
issued certificate dated 11.12.2021 stating that he had completed almost 6 years and
that his character in the jail was found to be good. There is chance of reformation and
taking into consideration the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, a balance
could be done and the sentence of imprisonment may be reduced to the period of
sentence already undergone by the appellant.
5. Though several points have been argued by the learned counsel for
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the appellant, ultimately, the learned counsel had urged only on
the question of sentence. He also submitted that taking into consideration the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances and that the incident had occurred during a quarrel between the father
and son while the son was in in inebriated condition and there was no intention for the son, the
appellant to murder his father, the sentence imposed by the Trial Court may be reduced taking into
consideration the mitigating and aggravating circumstances in this case.
6. In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the appellant would rely on the judgment of
a Division Bench of this court in Criminal Appeal No.317 of 2016, dated 22.8.2016 (Neelakandan vs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143979127/ 4
Unknown vs U on 16 December, 2021
State), wherein in a similar circumstances and facts, had sentenced the appellant to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for five years. In respect of considering the mitigating and aggravating
circumstances for reduction of sentence, the learned counsel would rely on the judment of the Apex
Court in State of M.P. vs. Suresh ((2019) 14 SCC 151).
7. Mr.S.Sugendran, learned Government Advocate (Crl. Side) would submit that from the date of
arrest, the appellant has been in custody and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Superintendent
of Central Prison, Vellore had given a certificate stating that the appellant had completed the
sentence for a period of 5 years 11 months and 12 days as on 11.12.2021 and as per the Certificate,
the conduct of the appellant is also good and he had also no bad antecedents.
8. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties.
9. A Division Bench of this court, in similar circumstances in Criminal Appeal No.317 of 2016, dated
22.8.2016 (Neelakandan vs. State), has held as under:-
"20. Now turning to the quantum of punishment, the accused is a poor man. He has
no bad antecedent and out of sudden provocation and heat of passion, he lost his
mental balance. While 11 consuming alcohol, there was a sudden quarrel between the
accused and the deceased and due to sudden provocation only, he dashed the
deceased against the wall without any intention to murder him. He is also an young
man. Considering the mitigating as well as aggravating circumstances, sentencing
him to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for 5 years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- in
default to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for four weeks would meets the ends of
justice."
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
10. Further, in several other cases, the Hon'ble Apex Court and our High Court, in similar
circumstances, taking into considering the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, have reduced
the sentence and awarded lesser punishment for offence punishable under Section 304(ii) IPC.
11. In State of M.P. vs. Suresh ((2019) 14 SCC 151), the Apex Court, relying on the decision in Alister
Anthony Pareira v. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 2 SCC 648, has held as under:-
"12. In Alister Anthony Pareira v. State of Maharashtra, the allegations against the appellant had
been that while driving a car in drunken condition, he ran over the pavement, killing 7 persons and
causing injuries to 8. He was charged for the offences under Sections 304 Part II and 338 IPC; was
ultimately convicted [State of Maharashtra v. Alister Anthony Pareira, 2007 SCC OnLine Bom 1490]
by the High Court under Sections 304 Part II, 338 and 337 IPC; and was sentenced to 3 years'
rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 5 lakhs for the offence under Section 304 Part II IPC and to
rigorous imprisonment for 1 year and for 6 months https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis respectively
for the offences under Sections 338 and 337 IPC. Apart from other contentions, one of the pleas
before this Court was that in view of fine and compensation already paid and willingness to make
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143979127/ 5
Unknown vs U on 16 December, 2021
further payment as also his age and family circumstances, the appellant may be released on
probation or his sentence may be reduced to that already undergone. As regards this plea for
modification of sentence, this Court traversed through the principles of penology, as enunciated in
several of the past decisions [ This Court referred, amongst others, to the decisions in State of
Karnataka v. Krishnappa, (2000) 4 SCC 75 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 755; Dalbir Singh v. State of Haryana,
(2000) 5 SCC 82 : 2004 SCC (Cri) 1208; State of M.P. v. Saleem, (2005) 5 SCC 554 :
2005 SCC (Cri) 1329; Ravji v. State of Rajasthan, (1996) 2 SCC 175 : 1996 SCC (Cri)
225; State of M.P. v. Ghanshyam Singh, (2003) 8 SCC 13 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1935] and,
while observing that the facts and circumstances of the case show “a despicable
aggravated offence warranting punishment https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
proportionate to the crime”, this Court found no justification for extending the
benefit of probation or for reduction of sentence. On the question of sentencing, this
Court re- emphasised as follows: (Alister Anthony Pareira case [Alister Anthony
Pareira v. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 2 SCC 648 :
(2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 848 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 953] , SCC p.
674, paras 84-85) "84. Sentencing is an important task in the matters of crime. One of the prime
objectives of the criminal law is imposition of appropriate, adequate, just and proportionate
sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of crime and the manner in which the crime is
done. There is no straitjacket formula for sentencing an accused on proof of crime. The courts have
evolved certain principles: the twin objective of the sentencing policy is deterrence and correction.
What sentence would meet the ends of justice depends on the facts and circumstances of each case
and the court must keep in mind the gravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the offence
and all other attendant circumstances.
85. The principle of proportionality in sentencing a crime- https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis doer is
well entrenched in criminal jurisprudence. As a matter of law, proportion between crime and
punishment bears most relevant influence in determination of sentencing the crime-doer. The court
has to take into consideration all aspects including social interest and consciousness of the society
for award of appropriate sentence."
13. Therefore, awarding of just and adequate punishment to the wrongdoer in case of proven crime
remains a part of duty of the court. The punishment to be awarded in a case has to be commensurate
with the gravity of crime as also with the relevant facts and attending circumstances. Of course, the
task is of striking a delicate balance between the mitigating and aggravating circumstances. At the
same time, the avowed objects of law, of protection of society and responding to the society's call for
justice, need to be kept in mind while taking up the question of sentencing in any given case. In the
ultimate analysis, the proportion between the crime and punishment has to be maintained while
further balancing the rights of the wrongdoer as also of the victim of the crime and the society at
large. No straitjacket formula for sentencing is available but the requirement of taking a holistic
view of the matter cannot be forgotten.

14. In the process of sentencing, any one factor, whether of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
extenuating circumstance or aggravating, cannot, by itself, be decisive of the matter. In the same
sequence, we may observe that mere passage of time, by itself, cannot be a clinching factor though,
in an appropriate case, it may be of some bearing, along with other relevant factors. Moreover, when
certain extenuating or mitigating circumstances are suggested on behalf of the convict, the other
factors relating to the nature of crime and its impact on the social order and public interest cannot
be lost sight of.
12. In this case, as stated above, the appellant was charged for the offence under Section 302 IPC,
however, the court had found him guilty for the offence under Section 304(ii) IPC and convicted and
sentenced him as stated above.
13. It is relevant to refer to Section 304(ii) IPC hereunder:-
"304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.--
Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished
with ..... ..... imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten
years, or with fine, or with both, if https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the act is done
with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause
death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. "
14. Though Section 304(ii) IPC mandates the sentence of imprisonment, it does not prescribe any
minimum sentence. When an accused has been convicted under Section 304(ii) IPC, he could be
sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to a period of ten years or with fine or with
both.
15. Now, coming to the facts of this case, the appellant is an unmarried man aged about 29 years.
The incident had happened on the eve of new year when the appellant was in an inebriated
condition and that he had burst crackers and when it was objected by his father, there was a quarrel
and out of sudden provocation and heat of passion, in an inebriated condition, the appellant, lost his
mental balance and had assaulted his father with a neem stick which was lying close-by.
16. Now, turning to the quantum of punishment, it is seen that the appellant hails from a lower
strata of the society. He is an uneducated and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis poor man. He has
no bad antecedents and that he has also undergone imprisonment from the date of arrest till today.
As per the Certificate issued by the Superintendent of Central Prison, Vellore, as on 11.12.2021, the
appellant has completed the sentence for a period of 5 years 11 months and 12 days. Further, the
Superintendent of Central Prison has also certified that the conduct of the appellant is good.
17. Therefore, keeping in view the principles laid down in the above cases and taking into
consideration the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of this case, this court is of the opinion
that the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of six years would serve the interest of
justice. Accordingly, the Criminal Appeal is partly allowed and while confirming the conviction, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/143979127/ 7
Unknown vs U on 16 December, 2021
sentence is modified to that of six years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.1000/- in default to
undergo simple imprisonment for a period of four weeks. The period of imprisonment already
undergone by the appellant shall be set off under Section 428 Cr.P.C. The connected Miscellaneous
Petition is closed.
