falsely implicated in the present case. False recovery of ornaments of yellow and white metal and
Rs.5600/- has been shown from the applicant. There is no independent witness to the alleged
recovery. Identically placed co-accused Ankit alias Komal alias Omkar Sonkar has been granted bail
by this Court vide order dated 6.2.2025 passed in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No.43062 of
2024. The applicant claims parity. The criminal history of the applicant has been explained in
paragraph no. 3 of the supplementary affidavit. The applicant is in jail since 05.09.2024 and in case,
he is enlarged on bail, he will not misuse the said liberty.
5. Learned AGA has opposed the prayer for bail but could not satisfactorily dispute the aforesaid
submissions from the record.
6. Having heard counsel for the parties and having perused the record this Court prima facie finds
that the applicant was not named in the first information report. There is no independent witness to
the alleged recovery. Identically placed co-accused Ankit alias Komal alias Omkar Sonkar has been
granted bail by this Court. Further, the applicant has remained confined for almost six months and
after submission of the charge-sheet there is no hope of early conclusion of trial, more so when no
reasonable apprehension has been brought to the fore by the State that the applicant, if enlarged on
bail, would either tamper with the evidence or delay the trial or intimidate the witness, without
commenting on merits of the case, I am of the opinion that the applicant is entitled to be enlarged
on bail.
7. Let the applicant Gopal Vishwakarma, involved in the aforesaid case crime be released on bail on
his furnishing a personal bond and two heavy sureties (in view of criminal history) each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to the conditions that he:
(i) shall appear on the date fixed by the trial court;
(ii) shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence;
(iii) shall not pressurize the prosecution witnesses.
8. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, the prosecution shall be at liberty to move bail
cancellation application before this Court.
