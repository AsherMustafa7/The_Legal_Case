revised building permission fee for Medical Institution is Rs. 3 per sqft. and that the petitioner, as
such, is liable to pay Rs. 54,600/- only. It is being stated that the said representation was not
reconsidered by the respondents compelling the petitioner to submit another representation to the
Minister for Housing and Urban Development Department J&K Government in this regard.
04. It is being next stated that the respondents finally issued the building permission in favour of
the petitioner on 09.05.2006 for construction and establishment of the Centre in question subject to
the fulfillment of various terms and conditions in response to which the petitioner deposited an
amount of Rs. 1,00,000/- with the respondents as building permission fee.
05. It is being next stated that the respondent 3 in terms of the impugned letter dated 29.08.2006
instead called upon the petitioner to deposit the second installment of Rs. 1,77,550/- as balance
amount of the building permission fee with the condition that in the event same is not deposited, the
building permission granted will be withdrawn.
06. The petitioner has maintained the instant petition while throwing challenge to the impugned
communication dated 29.08.2006 on multiple grounds urged in the petition.
07. Objections to the petition have been filed by the respondents wherein it is being stated that in
terms of the Master plan framed and drawn by the respondents vide SRO-263 for the year
2000-2001, the Medical Clinics and Nursing Homes fall under the category of "Commercial Use"
providing Rs. 25 per sqft. to be charged for raising a construction and that, as such, the building
permission fee worked out in the case of the petitioner had been Rs, 4,55,000/- out of which the
petitioner deposited Rs. 1,00,000/- only and failed to pay balance amount of Rs. 3,55,000/- in 03
quarterly installments.
In the objections it is being admitted that the building permission in question came to be accorded
in favour of the petitioner for construction and establishment of Cardiac Hospital/Centre at Rohi
Morh, Jammu subject to the payment of building permission free of Rs. 4,55,000/- payable in the
shape of demand draft. It is, however, being denied by the respondents in their objections that the
resolution dated 28.04.2000 referred by the petitioner is not applicable to the case of the petitioner
on the said resolution have been drawn requesting therein respondent 2 to increase the building
permission fee in respect of various commercial and non-commercial constructions.
It is also being denied that the communication impugned in the petition dated 29.08.2006 requiring
the petitioner to deposit the balance amount of building permission fee has been issued illegally,
arbitrarily or in violation of the resolution dated 28.04.2000.
Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
08. The short controversy raised by the petitioner in the instant petition is to the charging of
building permission fee in the sanction issued by the respondents for construction and
establishment of a Cardiac Care Centre at Rohi Morh, Jammu whereby the petitioner has been
charged Rs. 25 per sqft. under Commercial Category on the ground that same is against the mandate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/25502046/ 2
Dr. Dinesh Sudan vs State Of J&K And Others on 11 May, 2023
of resolution passed by the respondents dated 28.04.2000 forming Annexure-D to the petition
whereunder according to petitioner for the construction and establishment of a Medical Centre, the
respondents have to charge Rs. 3 per sqft. treating the said constitution under non- commercial
category.
09. The perusal of the resolution dated 28.04.2000 suggests that the Chairman of the Building
Permission Authority of local areas being Vice- Chairman of the Jammu Development Authority
proposed to increase the building permission fee for all land uses in local areas of Jammu City
(outside Municipal limits) in order to augment the resources of the Jammu Development Authority
(JDA) and resolved and provided therein the new fee structure for the various categories of
buildings referred in the resolution to be applicable w.e.f. 05.05.2000.
The first category of buildings in the resolution supra provide for Residential, Religious, Charitable,
Social, Medical Educational Hostel, Recreational Government Building with revised building
permission fee of Rs. 3 per sqft. as against the old rate of Rs. 1000/- per sqft., a flat rate of Rs.
2000/- and beyond 1000 sqft. Rs. 0550 for additional sqft. of the area.
The second category of buildings reflected in the resolution provide for the revision of building
permission fee in respect of Commercial/Industrial Banks, Financial Institutional, Corporation
revising the building permission fee to Rs. 25 per sqft. as against the old rate of Rs. 3 per sqft.
The emphasis is laid by the counsel for petitioner is that the building permission fee chargeable for
construction and establishment of the medical centre in question in fact falls under first category of
buildings reflected in the resolution dated 28.04.2000 and not under second category of
Commercial/Industrial Banks etc. etc. and, therefore, the respondents ought to have charged
building construction fee from the petitioner @ Rs. 3 per sqft. instead of Rs. 25 per sqft. The
contention of the counsel for the petitioner on a plain reading of the resolution seemingly is
misconceived and patently wrong, in that, the first category of buildings wherein the building
permission fee came to be revised at Rs. 3 per sqft. do not anywhere include therein the category of
medical centre/ nursing home or a hospital though providing for the category of medical
educational hostel which cannot by any sense of imagination said to be including a nursing
home/medical centre or a hospital like that of the petitioner. The cardiac care centre in question
sought to be constructed and established by the petitioner ex facie would fall under the second
category provided in the resolution dated 28.04.2000 supra being a commercial entity in nature
chargeable with Rs. 25 per sqft. as building permission fee has been revised in terms of the
resolution dated 28.04.2000.
10. The respondents in view of aforesaid position seemingly have rightly worked out the building
permission fee of the proposed centre in question of the petitioner in terms of the resolution supra
treating the construction and establishment of Centre in question/ a Nursing Home of the petitioner
under commercial category. The contention of the counsel for petitioner that the construction and
establishment of the Cardiac Care Centre in question ought to have been treated under first category
of the buildings provided in resolution dated 28.04.2000 is grossly misconceived and not
acceptable.
