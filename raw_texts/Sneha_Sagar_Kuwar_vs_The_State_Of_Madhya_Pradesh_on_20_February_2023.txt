IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
AT JABALPUR
WP No. 1651 of 2023
(SNEHA SAGAR KUWAR AND OTHERS Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS)
Dated : 20-02-2023
Smt. Sudha Gautam - Advocate for petitioners.
Shri G.P. Singh - Government Advocate for respondent/State.
Heard on admission/stay.
Petitioners are aggrieved by action/inaction of the respondents whereby they have not given access
to the petitioner to ameliorate for better exacting in profession by participating in selection process
for appointment to the post of Teacher under School Education Department.
Grievance as reflected in the petition is that petitioners are already selected on the post of Teacher
(Tribal Department). Now recruitment is going on for the School Education Department out of the
pool earlier created of the teachers. Since petitioners have already opted for Tribal Department,
therefore, they have been denied access to opt for School Education Department. This is the bone of
contention.
Issue notice to the respondents through registered A/D mode on payment of process fee within
three working days, returnable within two weeks.
Till the next date of hearing as an interim measure petitioners shall be allowed to participate in the
selection but their result shall not be declared by the respondents.
It is made clear that since it is an interim measure, therefore, this interim measure would be subject
to final out come of the petition and any equity cannot be claimed by the petitioners on the ground
of this interim order.
List the matter along with W.P. No.449/2023.
