2. The petitioners in W.P.No.43206/2018 claim to be the owners of subject properties bearing
property identification No.R1E-235 and R1E-235A situated at Sadaramangala Village (now under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 6
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
BBMP) White Field Main Road, Bengaluru. The subject properties have been developed by the
petitioners into a business complex and a luxury boutique hotel.
2.1 Petitioners contend that the subject properties were acquired by the respondents for the purpose
of Bangalore Metro Rail Project - Phase-II. Among the properties, subject property bearing property
identification No.R1E-235 was acquired vide preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the
Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 (for short 'the KIAD Act') issued on 22.09.2015
and the final notification dated 04.04.2016 was issued under Section 28(4) of the KIAD Act,
pursuant to which, the impugned General Award at Annexure-AC was passed on 25.10.2018.
Similarly, subject property bearing identification No.R1E-235A was acquired vide preliminary
notification dated 16.12.2017 and final notification dated 25.05.2018, pursuant to which, the
impugned General Award at Annexure-AD was passed on 25.10.2018.
3. The petitioners in W.P.No.53718/2017 claim to be the owners of subject properties bearing
property identification No.R1-171 and R1E-171 situated at Hoodi Village, K.R.Puram-3 Hobli,
Bangalore East Taluk, Bangalore Urban District. It is contended that the subject properties were
acquired by the respondents for the purpose of Bangalore Metro Rail Project - Phase-II. Among the
properties, subject property bearing property identification No.R1-171 was acquired vide
preliminary notification issued on 27.04.2015 and final notification dated 29.12.2015, while subject
property bearing property identification No.R1-E-171 was acquired vide preliminary notification
issued on 03.07.2017 and final notification dated 25.05.2017. But, no award has been passed so far;
however, the KIADB has issued an Official Memorandum dated 06.07.2017 directing payment of
compensation in favour of the petitioner under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
4. The writ petitioners in both the petitions are aggrieved by the impugned awards, official
memorandums, endorsements, communications, correspondence etc., by and between the State
Government, KIADB and BMRCL, the respondents herein insofar as the same relate to payment of
compensation for acquisition of the subject properties viz., in relation to the quantum of
compensation, deduction of income tax at source(TDS) on the compensation and non-grant of
exemption from payment of income tax on the compensation.
5. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the petitions and referring the material
on record, learned counsel for the petitioners made the following submissions:-
(i) The writ petitions are maintainable, despite availability of remedy seeking
enhancement of the compensation amount before the reference court which has been
availed of by the petitioners and the contention of the respondents in this regard is
liable to be rejected.
(ii) The petitioners are entitled to compensation under the provisions of the Right to
Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and
Resettlement Act, 2013 (for short 'the said Act of 2013'), which came into force w.e.f.
01.01.2014 and not under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short 'the said Act of
1894') and that the action of the respondents in not paying compensation to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 7
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
petitioners under the said Act of 2013 is illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory and not
justifiable in law.
(iii) The respondents are not entitled to deduct the tax at source (TDS) on the
compensation amount and the action of the respondents in deducting the tax at
source was illegal, discriminatory, arbitrary and contrary to the provisions of the said
Act of 2013 as well as the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short 'the
I.T.Act') in view of Section 96 of the said Act of 2013 and the Circular dated
25.10.2016 issued by the Central Board for Direct Taxes as well as Section 194-LA of
the I.T.Act w.e.f 01.04.2017.
(iv) The compensation payable in favour of the petitioners is also exempt from payment of income
tax and action of the respondents in not granting exemption and demanding payment of income tax
was also illegal, discriminatory, arbitrary and contrary to Section 96 of the said Act of 2013 as well
as the CBDT Circular dated 25.10.2016 and the provisions of Section 194-LA of the I.T. Act.
6. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in their statement of objections and
referring the material on record, learned Senior counsel for the BMRCL and the other counsel for
the respondents made the following submissions:-
(i) The writ petitions are not maintainable, in view of availability of equally
efficacious and alternative remedy of seeking enhancement of compensation before
the reference court, which has been availed of by the petitioners.
(ii) That the said respondents were fully justified in awarding compensation under
the said Act of 1894 and not under the said Act of 2013, which was not applicable to
KIADB acquisitions and the various contentions urged by the petitioners in this
regard are untenable and devoid of merit.
(iii) That the deduction of tax at source (TDS) on the compensation amount was
correct and proper and in accordance with law.
(iv) That the compensation payable in favour of the petitioners was not exempt from
payment of income tax and the demand for the said payment by the revenue was legal
and valid.
7. Both sides relied upon various judgments in support of their respective contentions.
8. The following points arise for consideration in the present petitions:-
(i) Whether the writ petitions are maintainable in view of the remedy of seeking
enhancement of compensation before the reference court being available to the
petitioners, who have already sought for such reference?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 8
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
(ii) Whether the petitioners are entitled to compensation under the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894 OR under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, in respect of their lands
acquired pursuant to preliminary notification issued after 01.01.2014 under Section
28(1) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966?
(iii) Whether the compensation payable in favour of the petitioners is exempt from
payment of tax deduction at source(TDS) and also from payment of income tax in
view of Section 96 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land
Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and Section 194-LA of the
Income Tax Act amended vide Finance Act 67 of 2017 w.e.f 01.04.2017 as well as the
CBDT Circular dated 25.10.2016?
Re. Point No.1:-
9. The respondents have contended that by claiming compensation under the said Act of 2013,
petitioners are actually claiming higher compensation than the compensation awarded in their
favour under the said Act of 1894 and since there exists an equally efficacious and alternative
remedy of seeking enhancement of compensation by way of reference to the reference court, the
present petitions are not maintainable particularly, when the petitioners have already sought for
reference seeking enhancement of compensation. In this context, it is relevant to state that there is
no nexus or connection between the claim of the petitioners that they are entitled to compensation
under the said Act of 2013 and their claim to seek enhancement of compensation before the
reference court; both claims/contentions are distinct, different and mutually exclusive and
independent of each other and merely because petitioners are entitled to seek / have sought for
reference, the said circumstance cannot be made the basis to come to the conclusion that the present
petitions are not maintainable as held in Union of India vs. Pushpavathi & others - (2018)3 SCC 28,
Smt.Channarajammanni vs. Union of India & others - AIR 1988 KAR 49 (DB) and the LAO
Hanmakonda vs. Pittala Saranga Pani- 1998 +(2) APLJ 20.
9.1 As held in the aforesaid decisions, merely because the remedy to seek enhancement before the
reference court is available to the petitioners and they have sought for reference, there is no
bar/prohibition for the petitioners to contend that they are entitled to compensation under the said
Act of 2013 and not under the said Act of 1894; in other words, the right to seek compensation
under the said Act of 2013 on the ground that the same was applicable and not the said Act of 1894
is completely different, distinct and mutually exclusive and independent from the right to seek
reference on the ground that the compensation awarded under either of the enactments is meager
and inadequate and deserves to be enhanced. Under these circumstances, I am of the considered
opinion that notwithstanding the availability of the remedy in favour of the petitioners to seek
enhancement before the reference court which they had already sought for, the present petitions
seeking awarding of compensation under the said Act of 2013 and not under the said of 1894 under
which the impugned awards have been passed are maintainable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 9
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
Point No.1 is accordingly answered in favour of the petitioners by holding that the present petitions
are maintainable.
Re: Point No.2:
10. Petitioners have contended that they are entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013
and the impugned awards and the decisions taken by the respondents awarding compensation
under the said Act of 1894 are illegal, arbitrary and deserve to be quashed and that the respondents
are to be directed to pass awards in favour of the petitioners under the said Act of 2013.
10.1 In this context, in addition to reiterating that it is an undisputed fact that the acquisition
proceedings insofar as the petitioners are concerned were initiated after 01.01.2014, my attention is
invited to the Board Resolution dated 27.08.2016 passed in 343rd Board meeting of the KIADB,
wherein it was decided and resolved that the provisions of the said Act of 2013 would be applicable
for the purpose of determination of compensation where lands were acquired pursuant to
notifications issued under Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act after 01.01.2014. It is pointed out that the
said resolution has not only been recognised, accepted, confirmed and affirmed by the respondents
but also by this Court in various litigations subsequently and awards have been passed by the
respondents directing payment of compensation under the said Act of 2013.
10.2 Secondly, it is contended that by applying and invoking the doctrine/principles of parity,
petitioners were entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013 and not under the said Act of
1894 which would amount to discrimination and be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of
India.
10.3 Thirdly, it is contended that Section 30 of the KIAD Act (prior to amendment vide Karnataka
Act No. 20 of 2022 w.e.f 05.04.2022) which provided for payment of compensation for KIADB
acquisitions under the said Act of 1894 was legislation by reference and not legislation by
incorporation and consequently, upon repeal of the said Act of 1894 and enactment of the said Act
of 1894, petitioners were entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013, since the impugned
awards were passed / to be passed after 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2013 came into force.
10.4 Fourthly, it is contended that Karnataka Industrial Areas Development (Amendment) Act,
2022 (Karnataka Act No. 20 of 2022) amended Section 30 of the KIAD Act w.e.f 05.04.2022
whereby the earlier Section 30 stood substituted with retrospective and retroactive effect from
01.01.2014 by making the provisions relating to compensation under the said Act of 2013 applicable
to KIAD acquisitions and on this score also, petitioners were entitled to compensation under the
said Act of 2013 and not under the said Act of 1894 which was not applicable to KIADB acquisitions
after 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2013 came into force.
10.5 The respondents have disputed all the aforesaid contentions urged by the petitioners and have
contended that the petitioners are entitled to compensation under the said Act of 1894 and not
under the said Act of 2013.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 10
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
10.6 The material on record discloses that in its 343rd Board meeting dated 27.08.2016, the KIADB
passed an unanimous resolution resolving and deciding as under:-
"26.10 The matter was considered in detail and after detailed deliberations, it was
resolved that affidavits to the effect that determination of compensation shall be as
per schedule 'I' of LARR Act for the purpose of section 29(3) of the KIAD Act be filed
in the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, in cases wherein notifications under Section
3(1) and 28(1) of the KIAD Act, 1966 have been issued on & after 01-01- 2014."
In W.P.Nos.48824-840/2015 - Smt.Puttalakshmamma vs. Union of India and others, the KIADB
filed its statement of objections dated 14.09.2016 as hereunder:
"the repugnancy in the KIAD Act, 1966 with the New Act, 2013 are in connection with
only the provision relating to the compensation accorded to the land loser. It is
submitted that dwelling upon the said issue the Board constituted under the KIAD
Act in its 343rd meeting held on 24.08.2016 has resolved that the compensation as
regards lands acquired under the KIAD Act,1966 shall be in tune with the New Act,
2013. A copy of the said resolution is herewith produced and marked as
Annexure-R1."
Similarly, in W.P.Nos.11209-11212/2019 - Smt. S.Jalaja &others vs. Union of India & others, the
KIADB filed its statement of objections on 13.03.2019 reiterating its stance as under:
"the repugnancy in the KIAD Act, 1966 with the New Act, 2013 are in connection with
only the provision relating to the compensation accorded to the land loser. It is
submitted that dwelling upon the said issue the Board constituted under the KIAD
Act in its 343rd meeting held on 24.08.2016 has resolved that the compensation as
regards lands acquired under the KIAD Act,1966 shall be in tune with the New Act,
2013."
10.7 Though several other issues arose for consideration in Jalaja's case supra including the vires of
Sections 28(4) and (5) of the KIAD Act, insofar as payment of compensation was concerned, in the
final order dated 05.04.2019, the learned Single Judge of this Court while disposing of the said
W.P.Nos.11209-11212/2019 held as under:-
"27. The genesis of the challenge to the provisions of the KIAD Act vis-à-vis the
notifications issued under Section 28[1] and 28[4] of the KIAD Act relates to the
visible distinction inasmuch as award of compensation under the two enactments
and apprehension of denial of the higher compensation which otherwise the
petitioners are legitimately entitled to, under the Act, 2013. This grievance of the
petitioners is addressed by the Board wherein, a specific stand has been taken in the
Statement of Objections filed by the Board, in paragraph 17, that the Board
constituted under the KIAD Act, in its meeting has resolved that the compensation as
regards lands acquired under the KIAD Act, shall be in tune with the New Act, 2013.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 11
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
The said paragraph is quoted hereunder for ready reference:
"17. Without prejudice to the aforementioned the doctrine of Severability is
applicable where though an enactment as a whole is within the legislative
competence of a legislature, particular provisions of the enactment go outside the
scope of the legislative entry under which the legislature enacted the law. It is
submitted that the repugnancy in the KIAD Act, 1966 with the New Act, 2013 are in
connection with only the provisions relating to the compensation accorded to the
land loser. It is submitted that dwelling upon the said issue the Board constituted
under the KIAD Act, 1966 in its meeting has resolved that the compensation as
regards lands acquired under the KIAD Act, 1966 shall be in tune with the New Act,
2013."
28. The learned Senior Counsel Sri.Ashok Haranahalli appearing on behalf of the Board also
substantiates the same on instructions. Further on the application filed by the petitioners bringing
subsequent events to the notice of the Court i.e., letter dated 04.10.2018, a communication issued
from the Special Deputy Commissioner, KIADB to the Special Land Acquisition Officer, wherein the
compensation has been fixed as per the recommendations of the Land Price Advisory Committee
which has been approved by the Board in its 356th meeting held on 20.09.2018, that the
compensation shall be awarded at Rs.50 Lakhs per acre on consent and if the land owners are not
agreeable for such consent awards, the award shall be made in accordance with law. The Board has
filed objections to the said application submitting that in terms of Section 29 of the KIAD Act, the
compensation of the lands acquired is to be determined and the award has to be made under Section
29[3] of the KIAD Act. In terms of Section 29[2] of the said Act, the State and the land looser can
enter into a consent agreement as regards the compensation. In case of the State and the land looser
failing to enter into consent agreement, an award under Section 29[3] of the Act shall be passed. The
Board in its 343rd meeting dated 24.08.2016 having discussed the said issue in detail, has resolved
that the affidavits to the said effect for determination of compensation shall be as per 'Schedule-I' of
the LARR Act for the purpose of Section 29[3] of the KIAD Act be filed in the Hon'ble High Court of
Karnataka in cases wherein notifications under Section 3[1] and 28[1] of the KIAD Act have been
issued on and after 01.01.2014. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Board placing reliance
on this resolution, submitted that the petitioners herein are entitled to compensation in terms of Act
2013 as admitted by the Board in Paragraph 17 of the statement of objections in pursuant to the said
resolution of the Board dated 24.08.2016. In view of the primary grievances of the petitioners being
redressed by the Board as aforesaid, the grounds urged by the petitioners in as much as
discrimination in resorting to the provisions of the KIAD Act, does not survive for consideration.
29. As could be seen, the resultant factors of getting compensation under the Act, 2013 being
achieved by the petitioners, in view of the undertaking given by the Board before this Court in terms
of the objections filed coupled with the submissions of the learned Senior counsel on instructions,
the writ petitions deserve to be dismissed.
30. Hence, the following:

L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
ORDER [i] Sections 28[4] and [5] of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development
Act, 1966 and the provisions contained in Chapter VII of the said KIAD Act are
intravires the Constitution of India.
[ii] The notifications dated 09.12.2016 as well as 20.07.2018 issued under Sections
28[1] and 28[4] of the KIAD Act are legally valid and enforceable.
[iii] The petitioners are entitled to compensation in terms of the Act, 2013 as per the
undertaking given by the KIADB before this Court in the event the petitioners are not
agreeable for a consent award under Section 29[2] of the KIAD Act.
With the aforesaid observations and directions, writ petitions are dismissed.
In view of the dismissal of the writ petitions, all the pending I.As stand disposed of.
10.8 As can be seen from the operative portion paragraph No.30(iii) of the aforesaid
order, this Court came to the conclusion that the land losers are entitled to
compensation under the said Act of 2013.
10.9 The aforesaid order was carried in appeal in W.A.No.1105/2019 & connected
matters and a submission was made on behalf of the KIADB and recorded in the
Daily Order dated 24.06.2019 as under:-
"The learned senior counsel appearing for the third respondent on instructions states
that the third respondent has accepted the impugned judgment and especially the
direction contained in clause (iii) of paragraph 30. The learned Additional
Government Advocate seeks time to take instructions on the question whether the
State intends to challenge the impugned judgment."
10.10 The said stance of the KIADB that the land losers are entitled to compensation under the said
Act of 2013 was also reiterated and re-affirmed by the State Government in its letter bearing No. CI
176 SPA 2019 dated 08.08.2019 addressed by the Principal Secretary to the Additional Government
Advocate.
10.11 Subsequently, in its final order dated 24.08.2021, the Division Bench of this Court dismissed
the said W.A.No.1105/2019 and connected matters inter alia confirming the order of the learned
Single Judge; in paragraph 6 of the order, the submission made by the learned Advocate General
that the land losers would be entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013 was noted and
held in paragraph 51 as under:-
6. Learned Advocate General, while referring to Section 29 of the 1966 Act and
Sections 26 to 28, 30(2) and First Schedule of the 2013 Act submitted that even
provisions pertaining to determination of compensation contained in both the
enactments are not in conflict with each other. Our attention has also been invited to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 13
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
resolution dated 27.08.2016 passed by the Board by which it has resolved to take into
account the components mentioned in First Schedule appended to the 2013 Act for
computation of market value of the land in respect of land which has to be acquired
under 1966 Act. It is therefore submitted that grievance of the owners of land insofar
as it pertains to challenge to provisions pertaining to determination of compensation
in fact does not survive. It is also urged that 1966 Act is a self contained code. In
support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of
Supreme Court in 'MAGANLAL CHHAGANLAL (P) LTD. V. MUNICIPAL
CORPORATION OF GREATER BOMBAY AND ORS.', (1974) 2 SCC 402 AND
'GIRNAR TRADERS V. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ORS.', (2011) 3 SCC 1. It is
also contended that issue with regard to applicability of Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act
to the proceeding under 1966 Act is no longer res integra and it has been held that
Section 24(2) does not apply to the proceeding under 1966 Act. In this connection,
reference has been made to decision of Supreme Court in 'SPECIAL LAND
ACQUISITION OFFICER, MYSORE V. ANASUYA BAI', (2017) 3 SCC 313.
51. By the aforesaid Amendment Act, the state government has been granted the
power to exempt the projects mentioned therein from the application of Chapter II
and III of the Act. The KIADB vide its resolution dated 27.08.2016 has resolved to
determine the amount of compensation in respect of the land which may be acquired
under 1966 Act as per Schedule I of 2013 Act. Therefore, the grievance of the owners
of the land in so far as it pertains to payment of lesser compensation under 1966 Act
does not survive. It has been urged on behalf of the owners of the land that the
provisions of the Karnataka Amendment Act 2019 are arbitrary and are opposed to
all canons of law and violative of Article 21. However, except for making such a
statement no material has been brought on record to show as to how the provisions
of Amendment Act are either arbitrary, violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of
India or unconstitutional. The provisions of the Amendment Act cannot also be said
to be in violation of Section 108 of 2013 Act which provides an option to the affected
families to avail better compensation an rehabilitation and resettlement, if state law
or policy so provides.
Thus, it is held that provisions of 2013 Act have been validly amended by the State legislature.
Accordingly the issue No.5 is answered.
10.12 Though the aforesaid order dated 24.08.2021 passed in W.A.No.1105/2019 and connected
matters has been challenged before the Apex Court in SLP(C) No.20912/2021 and connected
matters, the subject matter of challenge is with regard to other issues including validity of
acquisition, provisions of the KIAD Act etc., and not with regard to payment of compensation by the
respondents under the said Act of 2013; in other words, the order of the Division Bench(supra) has
attained finality and become conclusive and binding upon the State and KIADB. It is also relevant to
state that the respondents have proceeded to pass awards and have paid compensation in favour of
the land losers under the said Act of 2013 in respect of the lands which were the subject matter of
the aforesaid litigations as can be seen from the award at Annexure-AL dated 14.06.2019 and award
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 14
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
at Annexure-AN dated 30.01.2020.
10.13 The cumulative effect of the aforesaid facts and circumstances make it unmistakably clear that
not only the respondents have unequivocally and unambiguously decided, resolved, accepted and
acquiesced to the fact that the land losers were entitled to payment of compensation under the said
Act of 2013 in respect of KIADB acquisitions initiated pursuant to notification issued under Section
28(1) of the KIAD Act after 01.01.2014, but the respondents have also passed awards and paid
compensation to such land losers under the said Act of 2013. Further, as stated supra, the
entitlement of the land losers to receive compensation under the said Act of 2013 and the liability of
the respondents to pass awards and pay the same has same has been recognised, accepted,
confirmed and affirmed by this Court in the aforesaid litigations which have has attained finality
and become conclusive and binding upon the State and KIADB.
10.14 Under these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that in the light of the undisputed
fact that the subject lands of the petitioners have been acquired pursuant to notification issued
under Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act after 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2013 came into force,
petitioners would be entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013 and not under the said Act
of 1894 which was clearly not applicable for the purpose of payment of compensation in favour of
the petitioners.
10.15 Insofar as the other contentions urged by the petitioners with regard to payment of
compensation under the said Act of 2013 are concerned, viz., parity in payment of compensation
under different enactments, Section 30 of the KIAD Act (prior to amendment) being legislation by
reference and not legislation by incorporation, amendment to Section 30 of the KIAD Act by the
Karnataka Industrial Areas Development (Amendment) Act, 2022 (Karnataka Act No. 20 of 2022)
being retrospective in nature and operation etc., are concerned, in view of the aforesaid facts and
circumstances and my findings above that since the subject lands were notified for acquisition under
Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act subsequent to 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2014 came into force
and the petitioners are entitled to compensation from the respondents under the said Act of 2013,
the other contentions urged by both sides need not be gone into in the fact situation obtaining in the
instant case, in particular the undisputed fact that the lands have been notified for acquisition under
Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act subsequent to 01.01.2014. Under these circumstances, the aforesaid
other contentions urged by both sides with regard to applicability of the said Act of 2013 in relation
to compensation payable to the land losers are not gone into and the same are left / kept open to be
decided in an appropriate case.
Point No.2 is answered in favour of the petitioners by holding that they are entitled to compensation
under the said Act of 2013 and not under the said Act of 1894 and consequently, the impugned
awards, endorsements, orders, communications, official memorandums etc., issued/passed by the
respondents deserve to be quashed and the respondents are to be directed to pass fresh awards and
do all such necessary acts, deeds and things etc., for the purpose of paying compensation to the
petitioners towards acquisition of the subject lands under the said Act of 2013.
Re. Point No.3:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 15
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
11. The next question that arises for consideration is, whether the compensation payable in favour of
the petitioners is exempt from payment of tax deduction at source(TDS) and also from payment of
income tax. In this context, it is relevant to extract Section 96 of the said Act of 2013, which reads as
under:-
"96. Exemption from income-tax, stamp duty and fees.-No income tax or stamp duty
shall be levied on any award or agreement made under this Act, except under section
46 and no person claiming under any such award or agreement shall be liable to pay
any fee for a copy of the same."
11.1 On 25.10.2016, the Central Board of Direct Taxes issued the following Circular clarifying and
confirming that though there was no specific provision under the I.T.Act, Section 96 of the said Act
of 2013 provides exemption from payment of taxes and deduction of TDS in respect of
compensation paid under the said Act of 2013. The said CBDT Circular reads as under:-
Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of Revenue Central Board of
Direct Taxes ITA.II Division, North Block, New Delhi, the 25* of October, 2016 Sub :
Taxability of the compensation received bythe land owners for the land acquired
under the Right of Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLAAR Act) Reg.
Under the existing provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ('the Act') an agricultural
land which is not situated in specified urban area, is not regarded as a capital asset.
Hence, capital gains arising from the transfer. (including compulsory acquisition) of
such agricultural land is not taxable. Finance (No.2) Act, 2004 inserted Sec.10(37) in
the Act from 01.04.2005 to provide specific exemption to the capital gains arising to
an Individual or a HUF from compulsory acquisition of an agricultural land situated
in specified urban-limit subject to fulfillment of certain conditions for specified urban
land)
2. The RFCTLARR Act which came into effect from 1st January, 2014. in section 96,
inter-alia provides that income-tax shall not be levied on any Award or agreement
made (except those made under section 46) under the RFCTLARR Act. Therefore,
compensation received for compulsory acquisition of land under the RFCTLARR Act
(except those made under section 46 of RFCTLARR Act), is exempted from the levy
of Income tax.
3. As no distinction has been made between compensation received for compulsory
acquisition of agricultural land and non-agricultural land in the matter of providing
exemption from income-tax under the RFCTLARR Act the exemption provided under
Sec.96 of the RFCTLARR Act is wider in scope than the tax exemption provided
under the existing provisions of Income-tax Act. 1961. This has created uncertainty in
the matter of taxability of compensation received on compulsory acquisition of land,
especially those relating to acquisition of non-agricultural land. The matter has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 16
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
examined by the board and it is hereby clarified that compensation received in
respect of award or agreement which has been exempted from levy of income-tax
vide Sec.96 of RECTLARR Act shall also not be taxable under the provisions of
Income Tax Act, 1961 even if there is no specific provision of exemption for such
compensation in the Income Tax Act, 1961.
4. The above may be brought to the notice of all concerned.
5. Hindi version of the Order shall follow.

(Rohit Garg) 11.2 Subsequently, Section 194-LA of the I.T. Act was amended vide Finance Act 67 of
2017 w.e.f 01.04.2017 by inserting a second proviso. After the amendment, the section reads as
under:-
"194LA. Any person responsible for paying to a resident any sum, being in the nature
of compensation or the enhanced compensation or the consideration or the enhanced
consideration on account of compulsory acquisition, under any law for the time being
in force, of any immovable property (other than agricultural land), shall, at the time
of payment of such sum in cash or by issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode,
whichever is earlier, deduct an amount equal to ten per cent of such sum as
income-tax thereon:
Provided that no deduction shall be made under this section where the amount of
such payment or, as the case may be, the aggregate amount of such payments to a
resident during the financial year does not exceed two lakh and fifty thousand rupees:
Provided further that no deduction shall be made under this section where such
payment is made in respect of any award or agreement which has been exempted
from levy of income-tax under section 96 of the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (30 of
2013). (emphasis added) Explanation. -- For the purposes of this Section, --
(i) "agricultural land" means agricultural land in India including land situate in any
area referred to in items (a) and (b) of sub- clause (iii) of clause (14) of section 2;
(ii) "immovable property" means any land (other than agricultural land) or any
building or part of a building.
It is profitable to extract Section 10(37) of the I.T.Act, which reads as follows:-
10. Income not included in total income: In computing the total income of a previous
year of any person, any income falling within any of the following clauses shall not be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 17
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
included-
(37) in the case of an assessee, being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, any income
chargeable under the head "Capital gains" arising from the transfer of agricultural land, where-
(i) such land is situate in any area referred to in item (a) or item (b) of sub-clause (iii) of clause (14)
of section 2;
(ii) such land, during the period of two years immediately preceding, the date of transfer, was being
used for agricultural purposes by such Hindu undivided family or individual or a parent of his;
(iii) such transfer is by way of compulsory acquisition under any law, or a transfer the consideration
for which is determined or approved by the Central Government or the Reserve Bank of India;
(iv) such income has arisen from the compensation or consideration for such transfer received by
such assessee on or a after the 1st day of April, 2004.
Explanation - For the purposes of this clause, the expression "compensation or consideration"
includes the compensation or consideration enhanced or further enhanced by any
court, Tribunal or other authority;
11.3 A conjoint reading and the cumulative effect of Section 96 of the said Act of 2013,
the CBDT Circular dated 25.10.2016, Section 194-LA and Section 10(37) of the I.T.Act
make it abundantly clear that compensation payable in respect of the awards passed
subsequent to 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2013 came into force would be exempt
from payment of income tax as well from deduction of tax deduction at source(TDS).
In the instant case, the subject lands were acquired pursuant to preliminary
notifications issued under Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act subsequent to 01.01.2014
which were followed by the impugned awards as well as the impugned endorsements,
official memorandums, communications, orders, actions, etc., also undisputedly
issued after 01.01.2014.
11.4 Under these circumstances, having regard to Article 265 of the Constitution of
India, I am of the considered opinion that compensation payable in favour of the
petitioners, whose lands were notified for acquisition subsequent to 01.01.2014
would be exempt from payment of income tax as well as exempt from deduction of
tax deduction at source(TDS) and the impugned endorsements, communications,
orders, actions, etc., issued/passed by the revenue are illegal, arbitrary and without
jurisdiction or authority of law and liable to be quashed.
11.5 Under similar circumstances in relation to lands acquired for Metro Railways, a
Learned Single Judge of the Kerala High Court in the case of Viswanathan M vs. The
Chief Commissioner and others - 2020 (2) KLJ 309 and a Division Bench of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 18
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of C.Nanda Kumar v. Union of India and
others -
2017 SCC Online Hyd 55 have held that compensation payable to land losers would
be exempt from payment of income tax.
11.6 It is sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the revenue that Section
96 of the said Act of 2013, CBDT Circular dated 25.10.2016, Section 194-LA and
Section 10(37) of the I.T. Act are applicable only to the lands acquired under the said
Act of 2013 and not to the lands acquired under the KIAD Act. It is pointed out that
Section 96 of the said Act of 2013 Act employs the language "award or agreement
made under this Act" and not "award or agreement made as per this Act" and
therefore, in view of the express language employed by the legislature, the benefit of
exemption from payment of income tax or tax deduction at source (TDS) cannot be
claimed by the petitioners. The said contentions urged by the revenue cannot be
accepted for more than one reason:-
(i) Firstly, while dealing with Point No.2 with regard to the question as to whether the
compensation was payable to the petitioners under the said Act of 2013 or under the
said Act of 1894, I have already come to the conclusion that the petitioners are
entitled to compensation under the said Act of 2013.
(ii) Secondly, having regard to the aims and objects of the said Act of 2013 which is a
beneficial piece of legislation, so long as compensation itself is made payable under
the said Act of 2013, it makes no difference whether award or agreement is made
"under the Act" or "as per the Act".
(iii) Thirdly, the material on record discloses that undisputedly, all awards made and compensation
paid by the respondents in relation to KIADB acquisitions after 01.01.2014 are under the said Act of
2013 by granting/giving complete exemption from payment of income tax and from tax deduction at
source(TDS) as can be seen from the awards vide Annexure-AL dated 14.06.2019 and Annexure-AN
dated 30.01.2020 passed in Jalaja's case and connected matters (supra).
(iv) Fourthly, the KIAD Act does not have any specific provision enabling passing of an award and
Section 30 (prior to amendment) envisaged passing of an award under the said Act of 1894;
however, as held by me while answering question No.2, the said Act of 1894 was not applicable to
awards and compensation in respect of KIAD acquisitions subsequent to 01.01.2014, to which the
said Act of 2013 was applicable; it follows there from that awards and compensation cannot be
passed and made under the said Act of 1894 in respect of KIAD acquisitions after 01.01.2014 and the
same can be passed and made only under the said Act of 2013. Consequently, since all awards and
compensation subsequent to 01.01.2014 would be under the said Act of 2013 which would be
applicable to the same, the aforesaid provisions, viz., Section 96 of the said Act of 2013, the CBDT
Circular dated 25.10.2016, Section 194-LA and Section 10(37) of the I.T.Act would also be applicable
to all awards and compensation subsequent to 01.01.2014, all of which, would be entitled to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 19
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
benefit of exemption from payment of income tax and from tax deduction at source(TDS).
(v) Lastly, I have already come to the conclusion that the impugned awards, endorsements, orders,
communications, official memorandums, actions etc., of the respondents directing payment of
income tax and tax deduction at source (TDS) on the subject compensation amounts are illegal,
arbitrary and without jurisdiction or authority of law and that the same deserve to be quashed and
the respondents are to be directed to pass fresh / modified awards and do all such necessary acts,
deeds and things etc., in favour of the petitioners under the said Act of 2013. As noted supra,
Karnataka Industrial Areas Development (Amendment) Act, 2022 (Karnataka Act No. 20 of 2022)
amended Section 30 of the KIAD Act w.e.f 05.04.2022, whereby the provisions relating to
compensation under the said Act of 2013 have been made applicable to KIAD acquisitions.
Consequent upon the passing of the present order, the respondents would necessarily have to pass
fresh/modified awards and do all such necessary acts, deeds and things etc., in favour of the
petitioners under the said Act of 2013 which has been made applicable to KIADB acquisitions in
view of the amendment to Section 30 of the KIAD Act w.e.f 05.04.2022.
11.7 Viewed from this angle also, though the question as to whether the said amendment to Section
30 is prospective or retrospective has not been gone into in the present order and the same is left
open to be decided in an appropriate case, in the light of the undisputed fact that the respondents
would necessarily have to pass fresh/modified awards and do all such necessary acts, deeds and
things etc., in favour of the petitioners under the said Act of 2013, Section 96 of the said Act of 2013,
CBDT Circular dated 25.10.2016, Section 194-LA and Section 10(37) of the I.T.Act would become
applicable to the petitioners who would be entitled to the benefit of exemption from payment of
income tax and from tax deduction at source(TDS) in respect of the awards and compensation in
their favour.
11.8 In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the contentions urged on behalf of the revenue
cannot be accepted. I am therefore of the considered view that all awards and compensation payable
/ paid subsequent to 01.01.2014 when the said Act of 2013 came into force would be exempt from
payment of income tax and also exempt from tax deduction at source (TDS) and the land losers
would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of the said awards and compensation.
Point No.3 is also answered in favour of the petitioners by holding that the impugned awards,
endorsements, orders, communications, actions etc., of the respondents directing payment of
income tax and tax deduction at source(TDS) on the subject compensation amounts are illegal,
arbitrary and without jurisdiction or authority of law and that the same deserve to be quashed and
the respondents are to be directed to pass fresh/modified awards and do all such necessary acts,
deeds and things etc., in favour of the petitioners under the said Act of 2013 by exempting the
petitioners from payment of income tax and tax deduction at source(TDS) on the compensation
amounts paid/payable in their favour.
12. On overall consideration of the entire material on record, the legal principles that emerge from
the aforesaid discussion can be summarised as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/73192763/ 20
L. Venkataramana Raju vs Union Of India on 21 April, 2022
(i) All awards passed and compensation payable / paid in favour of land losers
pursuant to preliminary notification under Section 28(1) of the Karnataka Industrial
Areas Development Act, 1966, issued subsequent to 01.01.2014 would have to be
under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and not under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894.
(ii) All awards passed and compensation payable / paid in favour of land losers under the awards or
by way of agreement subsequent to 01.01.2014 in respect of KIADB acquisitions would be exempt
from payment of income tax.
(iii) All awards passed and compensation payable / paid in favour of land losers under the awards or
by way of agreement subsequent to 01.01.2014 in respect of KIADB acquisitions would also be
exempt from tax deduction at source (TDS).
13. In the result, I pass the following:-
ORDER
(i) W.P.No.43206/2018 and W.P.No.53718/2017 are hereby allowed;
(ii) The impugned awards in W.P.43206/2018 at Annexure-AC dated 25.10.2018 and
