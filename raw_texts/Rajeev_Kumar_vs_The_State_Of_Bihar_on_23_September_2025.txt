CORAM: HONOURABLE JUSTICE SMT. G. ANUPAMA CHAKRAVARTHY
ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 23-09-2025
1. The Writ petition is filed for the following reliefs:-
"for issuance of appropriate
writ/writs for direction to consider,
recommend and issue Public Distribution System License to petitioner by setting aside the letter
no.-522 dt.-9.03.2019 to the extent of Respondent no.-7 Placed at Sl. No.-40 in the
Recommendation List and further to restrain Respondents to Patna High Court CWJC No.9258 of
2019 dt.23-09-2025 issue PDS License to Respondent No.-7, in the interest of Justice."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the

license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the Patna High Court CWJC No.9258 of 2019 dt.23-09-2025 other party
under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of, whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.
Patna High Court CWJC No.9258 of 2019 dt.23-09-2025
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within one month from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same.
Patna High Court CWJC No.9258 of 2019 dt.23-09-2025
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
