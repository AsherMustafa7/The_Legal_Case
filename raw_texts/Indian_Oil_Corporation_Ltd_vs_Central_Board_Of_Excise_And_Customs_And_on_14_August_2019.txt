Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144421409/ 1
Indian Oil Corporation Ltd vs Central Board Of Excise And Customs And ... on 14 August, 2019
Constitution of India is filed to question the order dated
03.05.2017
purportedly passed by the respondent No.1 Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017
dt.14-08-2019 summarily rejecting the application of the petitioner for condonation of delay in
exercise of powers vested under Rule 17 of the Customs, Central Excise Duties and Service Tax
Drawback Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Drawback Rules'). The petitioner alongside
also questions the order dated 16.11.2015 passed by the respondent No.2, the Joint Secretary,
Government of India in reversing the order passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) Custom, Central
Excise and Service Tax, Patna. The third order questioned by the petitioner is the order dated
08.08.2011 passed by the respondent No.4, the Joint Commissioner, Central Excise and Service Tax,
Patna whereby the application filed by the petitioner for fixation of brand rate for the April, 2010
was not held maintainable because the Commissioner in exercise of powers vested under Rule 6(1)
had refused to condone the delay. Copies of the orders dated 3.5.2017 passed by the Government of
India under Section17, on revision and by the Joint Commissioner are impugned at Annexures 7,5
and 3 respectively to the writ petition.
Facts of the case briefly stated is the petitioner is a public sector undertaking of the Government of
India and is engaged in the business of manufacture of Petroleum products. A memorandum is
stated to have been entered between Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019
Government of India and the Government of Nepal for export of petroleum products namely, High
Speed Diesel (H.S.D), Motor Spirit (M.S), Superior Kerosene Oil (SKO) and Liquified Petroleum
Gas(LPG) to the Nepal Oil Corporation. It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner has been
exporting petroleum products through Land Customs Stations from its different marketing
installations and is entitled to claim fixation of brand rate under 'the Drawback Rules'. The case of
the petitioner is that it is in this connection and for fixation of brand rate for the month of April,
2010 that the petitioner made an application to the respondent No.4, the Joint Commissioner of
Central Excise in the prescribed format on 29.06.2010, a copy of which is at Annexure-1 series. The
petitioner also filed application for condonation of delay on 18.08.2010 before the respondent No.3,
the Commissioner of Central Excise, a copy of which is at Annexure-2. This application of the
petitioner was held not maintainable by the respondent No.4, Joint Commissioner on grounds that
the Commissioner had refused to condone the delay. A copy of such order dated 08.08.2011
circulated vide memo No.795 dated 09.08.2011 is impugned at Annexure-3 to the writ petition. The
petitioner filed a statutory appeal before the Commissioner (Appeals) which was allowed by order
dated Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 11.10.2012 at Annexure-4 to the writ
petition with consequential reliefs. The department went in revision before the Government of India
and by order dated 16.11.2015 impugned at Annexure- 5, the revision was allowed and the
application for brand rate fixation filed by the petitioner was held time barred. A memorial by the
petitioner before the Government of India in its Ministry of Finance has also been rejected by order
dated 03.05.2017 impugned at Annexure-7 and feeling aggrieved the petitioner is before this Court.
We have heard Mr. D.V. Pathy, learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Satya Prakash Tripathy,
learned Senior Standing counsel for the department and we have perused the records.

It is because the orders of the statutory authorities in refusing to condone the delay despite the
explanation given by the petitioner in his condonation at Annexure-2 was not backed by reasons
that we were persuaded to direct the department to produce the records of the proceedings relatable
to the petitioner by our order dated 16.4.2019 and which has since been produced. Since the
application of the petitioner at Annexure-1 series to claim the benefit under 'the Drawback Rules' for
fixation of brand rate has not been rejected, on merits, Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017
dt.14-08-2019 the limited issue which falls for consideration before us is whether the rejection of the
condonation application is backed by reasons and/or whether the Commissioner (Appeals) having
found merit in the explanation given by the petitioner in his condonation application to condone the
delay, there was any occasion for the superior authorities to interfere therewith.
While handing over the records a list of dates was also provided by the learned counsel for the
department and which made reference to an order dated 2/5.07.2010 holding the application of the
petitioner for fixation of brand rate, not maintainable. This fact was obviously an obstruction in
consideration of the claim of the petitioner because in case the application of the petitioner for
fixation of brand rate under 'the Drawback Rules' filed on 29.6.2010 itself was held not maintainable
on 2/5.07.2010 then there was no occasion to entertain the condonation application filed for
condonation of delay in filing the application for fixation of brand rate under 'the Drawback Rules'.
We thus posted this matter on 29.07.2019 and again on 08.08.2019 allowing the parties to address
on this issue because if the main application itself stood rejected then there was no occasion for any
condonation to be filed.
The position was contested by Mr. Pathy to submit Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017
dt.14-08-2019 that since the order dated 2/5.07.2010 had never been communicated to the
petitioner, it had no meaning. He further submits that in case the main application itself was
rejected then there was no occasion for the statutory authority to entertain the condonation
application which indeed was entertained and consequently rejected to hold the main application as
not maintainable. According to Mr. Pathy, if the main application filed for fixation of brand rate was
rejected on 2/5.07.2010 then the orders holding the application not maintainable consequent upon
rejection of the condonation application had no meaning. Proceeding here from, he submits that
since by the orders impugned the statutory authorities have held the application filed by the
petitioner for fixation of brand rate not maintainable because the condonation had been refused by
itself confirms that this order dated 2/5.07.2010 was never acted upon.
Learned counsel for the department opposing the writ petition has submitted that since the reasons
assigned by the petitioner for condonation of delay did not persuade the statutory authorities to
condone the delay hence no interference is called for in the decision taken.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and we have perused the records.
Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 As we have observed above, the only issue
which falls for consideration before us is whether the rejection of the condonation application is
backed by reasons as also whether there was any occasion for the revisional authority to interfere
with the order passed by the appellate authority to condone the delay and to allow the application.

In fact, there is no contest on merits of the claim as well as on the entitlement of the petitioner to
seek a brand rate rather the only impediment on such relief is the delay whatsoever. In other words,
if the delay is condoned, the relief is consequential.
We would first of all consider the order dated 2/5.07.2010 which finds reference in the list of dates
to inform that the application of the petitioner for fixation of brand rate was rejected. The said order
bearing Memo No. 237 dated 2/5.07.2010 can be found at page 61 of the file and it is while
informing the Accounts Officer of the petitioner of the deficiencies noticed in his application that he
was communicated that the application is not maintainable. According to Mr. Pathy, whatever
deficiencies was noticed, was removed by the petitioner and that those letter was either not
communicated or not acted upon because the condonation application was taken up for
consideration on merits. Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 We find
substance in the submission made by Mr. Pathy, because at page 79 we find re-submission of revised
application by the petitioner on 23.07.2010 together with enclosures and which was acted upon as
confirmed from the subsequent correspondences on the records of the file. Meaning thereby, the
deficiencies being removed, the application was entertained and in the meanwhile the petitioner
filed his application for condonation of delay on 18.08.2010 which according to the order of the
Joint Commissioner at Annexure-3 was rejected by the Commissioner as he did not consider it a fit
case for allowing extension of 30 days.
Mr. Pathy has invited our attention to the chart at Annexure-12 series to submit that it contains the
details of the exports made by the petitioner from its different marketing installations and a cursory
glance of the delay caused in filing the application would confirm that it is in between 1 to 30. In
other words, it is within the power of condonation vested in the Commissioner. Since the order of
the Joint Commissioner dated 08.08.2011 impugned at Annexure-3 simply held the application not
maintainable on grounds that the condonation application had been rejected by the Commissioner
and the reasons thereof was not explained, although the petitioner in his condonation Patna High
Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 application at Annexure-2 had specifically mentioned
that it is in the process of gathering information from its marketing location covering different Land
Customs Station that some delay had occurred and which was prayed to be condoned, that we were
persuaded to examine the reasons that crossed the mind of the Commissioner to refuse
condonation.
On perusal of the file, we were surprised to note that no formal order was passed in this regard
although the consideration of condonation application and its disposal was a quasi judicial
discharge by the Commissioner of Central Excise. In fact it is through a file noting and a simple
query by the Commissioner as to the 'grounds for condonation' which has been interpreted as a
rejection of the application. The file noting confirms that the Commissioner has simply noted that a
condonation can be considered where an applicant had provided adequate evidence of being
prevented by sufficient cause in filing the application within the prescribed time but if no reason has
been cited then on what grounds the condonation can be granted. We notice that this query by the
Commissioner has been interpreted as a rejection and the communication to such effect was made
by the Additional Commissioner to the Accounts Officer of the petitioner vide his order dated Patna
High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 16.09.2010.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd vs Central Board Of Excise And Customs And ... on 14 August, 2019
We are surprised by the manner in which the issue has been handled because apart from the fact
that the petitioner had mentioned reasons in his application dated 18.08.2010 to pray for
condonation of delay, a copy of which is at Annexure-2 there is no positive order by the
Commissioner, Central Excise to reject this application rather it is simple query which has been
interpreted as a rejection.
The other lacuna of the proceeding is that in case the Commissioner was not satisfied on the reasons
assigned by the petitioner in his condonation application, he should have afforded an opportunity to
the petitioner to clarify the position but certainly the manner of disposal of the condonation
application leaves much to be desired.
In our opinion, the communication in this regard made by the Additional Commissioner through
the letter dated 16/22.09.2010 is not a correct reproduction of the state of affairs in absence of any
formal order of rejection and consequently the order of the Joint Commissioner in treating the said
observation as a rejection of the condonation application to hold the application of the petitioner as
not maintainable suffers from the same infirmity.
Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 Such mechanical rejection was questioned
by the petitioner in appeal and the Commissioner (Appeals) by his order dated 11.10.2012 at
Annexure-4 has taken note of the stipulations present in Rule 6 and 7 of 'the Drawback Rules' in so
far as it vested jurisdiction in the Commissioner to condone the delay in filing application under 'the
Drawback Rules' which had been further expanded by the amendment dated 24.6.2010.
Rule 6 of 'the Drawback Rules' as it stood amended under the 2006 Amendment Rules in so far as it
provides for condonation reads as under:
"6(1)(a) Where no amount or rate of drawback has been determined in respect of any
goods, any manufacturer or exporter of such goods may, within sixty days from the
date relevant for the applicability of the amount or rate of drawback in terms of
sub-rule (3) of rule (5), apply in writing to the Commissioner of Central Excise or the
Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, having jurisdiction over the
manufacturing unit, of the manufacturer exporter or, of the supporting
manufacturer, as the case may be, for determination of the amount or rate of
drawback thereof stating all the relevant facts including the proportion in which the
materials or components or inputs services are used in the production or
manufacture of goods and the duties paid on such materials or components or the tax
paid on input services:
Provided that such Commissioner of Central Excise or the Commissioner of Customs
and Central Excise, as the case may be, may, if he is satisfied that the manufacturer or
exporter was Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 prevented by
sufficient cause from filing the application within the aforesaid time allow such
manufacturer or exporter to file such application within a further a period of thirty
day;

.........................................................."
It is not in dispute that the application of the petitioner filed on 29.6.2010, was within the
condonable period present in the proviso.
The said provision was amended vide notification dated 24.6.2010 whereunder the claim could be
filed within 3 months from the date of Let Export Order and which could be further extended by 3
months by the Assistant Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner and by another 6 months by
the Commissioner. The Government of India in its Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue vide
Circular No. 13 of 2010 circulated on 24.6.2010 amended the time limit in respect of the claim
raised under Rule 6 and 7 of 'the Drawback Rules'. There were amendments made by the said
Circular as to the time limits prescribed in other provisions as well but in so far as the claims under
Rule 6 and 7 is concerned which is the subject matter of consideration, the time limit for filing the
application was enhanced to 3 months from the date the Let Export Order and which could be
further extended by 3 months either by AC/DC and another 6 months by the Commissioner. The
date is Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 very relevant because the circular
was enforced on 24.06.2010 revising the time limit for filing the claim for brand rate application,
which was filed by the petitioner on 29.6.2010 i.e after the revised time limit came into force and
within the extended time period allowed under the amended Rules of 2006, which was condonable
at the hands of the Commissioner. Now while the application of the petitioner was filed within the
condonable period provided in the proviso to Rule 6(1) that the time limit so prescribed itself was
amended vide Circular No.13 of 2010 circulated on 24.6.2010 i.e prior to the filing of the application
on 29.6.2010 to claim for fixation of brand rate under 'the Drawback Rules', he became entitled to
the benefit of the revised time limit. The Commissioner (Appeals), while considering the appeal
preferred by the petitioner has taken note of the fact that the factum of export was not in dispute
and that the dispute was on the issue of delay, which was fit for condonation on the reasons assigned
as also in view of the revised time limit prescribed in the circular No.13 of 2010 dated 24.6.2010.
In our opinion, where Rule 6 of 'the Drawback Rules' as it stood amended by the Amendment Rules,
2006 allowed an applicant to file his application within 60 days of the Patna High Court CWJC
No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 date of Let Export Order which could be extended by further 30
days by the Commissioner on recording satisfaction, that the petitioner filed his application for
fixation of brand rate within this period of 90 days accompanied with an application for
condonation of delay and before such application of the petitioner as well as the condonation
application could be disposed on its merits, the time limit itself got revised much prior thereto on
24.6.2010, the statutory authorities were bound to consider the application because not only the
time limit was revised much before filing of the application by the petitioner on 29.6.2010 but even
the condonation application gave valid reasons for the delay caused.
The Commissioner (Appeals) has taken note of the relevant dates to allow the application of the
petitioner on its merit and which decision of the Commissioner (Appeals) has been erroneously
interfered with by the Joint Secretary purportedly exercising the powers of the Government of India
simply on grounds that the Circular dated 24.6.2010 had no retrospective application and cannot be
extended to an export of April, 2010.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd vs Central Board Of Excise And Customs And ... on 14 August, 2019
In our opinion the very premise drawn is erroneous because the prayer to condone the delay in filing
any application Patna High Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 seeking such privilege, is
always relatable to an event which has taken place earlier and while Rule 6 as it originally existed,
allowed such claim application to be filed within 60 days which limit could be extended by further
30 days under the order of the Commissioner, the only legal position that has under gone a change
by the Circular no.13 of 2010 dated 24.6.2010 of the Government of India is to revise the time limit
not only in respect of filing of the claim application but also in respect of the power to condone the
delay. The very fact that this time limit was revised during the period available to the petitioner to
file his claim application albeit accompanied with petition for condonation of delay, his claim would
sail within the jurisdiction of revised time period and the import of the Circular dated 24.6.2010 to
apply to such cases, has been correctly interpreted by the Commissioner (Appeals) and has been
illegally interfered with not only in the order of the Joint Secretary purportedly exercising the power
of the Government of India but also in the rejection of the application under rule 17 of the rules by
the order dated 03.05.2017.
Another lacuna which we find in this proceeding is that although the revisional jurisdiction is to be
exercised by the Government of India in its Ministry of Finance which would Patna High Court
CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 obviously be the head of the Department but such power has
been usurped by the Joint Secretary which exercise is de hors the statutory conferment. It is also
informed by Mr. Pathy that the Joint Secretary to the Government of India is an officer in the rank
equal to the Commissioner (Appeals). Thus apart from the fact that the orders impugned fail to
sustain on merits even on the decision making process, the order dated 16.11.2015 purportedly
exercised power by the Joint Secretary Government of India to interfere with the order passed by
the Commissioner (Appeals) is lawfully neither sustainable on merits nor on the manner of
discharge.
Having heard counsel for the parties we hold that the remarks of the Commissioner on the
condonation application would not amount to rejection of the condonation application in absence of
any order to such effect. Besides, the fact that such remark was interfered by the Commissioner
(Appeals) to find merit in the explanation to the delay given by the petitioner coupled with the
revised time limit under the Circular dated 24.6.2010, the order of the Joint Secretary dated
16.11.2015 in purported exercise of revisional jurisdiction impugned at Annexure-5 together with
letter dated 03.05.2017 of the Under Secretary, Government of India in its Ministry of Patna High
Court CWJC No.10514 of 2017 dt.14-08-2019 Finance impugned at Annexure-7 are on complete
misappreciation of the legal position and are accordingly quashed and set aside.
The writ petition is allowed and since the claim of the petitioner has been allowed by the
Commissioner (Appeals) the consequences shall follow and made available to the petitioner within a
period of 3 months from the date of receipt/ production of a copy of this judgment.
Let the records so produced by Mr. Satya Prakash Tripathi be returned to him for onward
transmission to the department.
