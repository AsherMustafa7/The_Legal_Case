Rameshwar Prasad Roy vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 17 April, 2019
The petitioner was appointed as a Typist in the year 1977 was granted promotion as Junior Selection
Grade Typist/Head Typist and, accordingly, he was receiving the scale of pay of Rs.1400-2600/-.
The State Government has accepted the recommendation of the Six Pay Revision Commission
Report and, Patna High Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019 accordingly, at the later stage,
the BIADA has also accepted and implemented the recommendation of Six Pay Revision
Commission Report and, accordingly, the pay scale of the petitioner has been fixed at the scale of
Rs.4000-6000/-, but the counsel for the petitioner submits that he was given the wrong
replacement scale of pay. As per the scale provided in the Sixth Pay Revision Commission Report, he
is entitled to pay scale of Rs.5000-8000/-, which is replacement scale of Rs.1400-2600/-. It has
further been said that the pay scale of the petitioner was earlier fixed in the scale of
Rs.5000-8000/-, which is apparently clear from Annexure-2 he continued to receive the same pay
scale, for about eight months and, later on, the Government has revised his pay scale to his
prejudice, lower down to the scale of Rs.4000- 6000/-. He has placed reliance on Annexure-3, has
drawn the attention of this Court that for implementation of the Sixth Pay Revision Commission
Report, the Finance Department as well as Industries Department granted approval for the
implementation of the same as earlier vide letter dated 05.01.2000 moratorium was applied for
enforcement of implementation of Sixth Pay Revision on account of bad financial condition of the
BIADA, by subsequent letter, the moratorium was withdrawn and it was decided to grant the benefit
of the Sixth Pay Revision. As per the Patna High Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019
petitioner that certain typists of BIADA were granted the pay scale of Rs. 1400-2600/- but he was
granted wrong pay scale of Rs. 1400-2300/- which was later on corrected by the BIADA.
In the present case, only dispute is with regard to entitlement of pay scale of Rs. 5000-8000/- and
he has stated that the replacement scale of Rs. 1400-2600/- is the pay scale of 5000- 8000/- has
specifically placed reliance on the schedule as scale mentioned therein has been implemented in
connection with the employees of the State Government, submitted that the pay scale of Rs.
1400-2600/- in Item No. 9 the replacement scale is Rs. 5000-8000/-, so he is claiming the said
amount and also he is submitting that he is also entitled for arrears of pay and claiming the arrears
of pay w.e.f. 01.04.1997, whereas, counsel for the BIADA has submitted that the scale of pay of Rs.
5000-8000/- was not implemented to the employee of the BIADA, which has been specifically
stated in paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit in the following term:
"That it is further submitted pay scale of Rs. 5000-8000 w.e.f. 1.1.1996 is not
applicable for the post of typist in BIADA and thus the claim of the petitioner for
higher pay scale for the said post i.e. Rs. 5000-8000 is not sustainable on the ground
that the said pay scale is applicable to typists of the State Government."
Patna High Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019 Learned counsel for the BIADA has further
submitted that the petitioner was not holding the post of head typist but he was getting pay scale of
Rs. 1400-2600/- in the Junior Selection Grade that does not mean that he was holding the post of
Head Typist, he has further submitted that after the implementation of Sixth Pay Revision
Commission Report, the fitment has to be made according to the availability of the post in the
department or in the organization and, at the same time, in the Sixth Pay Revision, the provision of
time bound promotion has been withdrawn as after the implementation of Sixth Pay Revision, there

is no such provision for granting the Junior Selection Grade/ Senior Selection Grade, but the
replacement scale will be on the post to post basis but the promotion would be on the basis of need
basis, in that term, the post is to be identified. As the petitioner was getting the pay scale of Rs.
1400-2600/- its replacement scale is Rs. 4000-6000/-, which is apparently clear from the chart
attached with the Office Order No. 1667 dated 22.09.2006 (Annexure 3), where at the top, it is
mentioned that by Resolution No. 2538 dated 16.09.2003, the BIADA was created at the end
mentions about attachment of annexure. The post under item (Kha) of the Chart having not been
sanctioned, but they have been given the benefit of revision of pay scale of Six Pay Revision, in Item
No. 13, the Patna High Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019 post of typist is there and the
pay scale has been given as Rs. 4000-6000/- and it has been mentioned that it is equivalent to the
pay scale of Secretariat staff. So in this view of the matter, the BIADA has not done any wrong with
the petitioner in granting the pay scale of Rs. 4000-6000/-.
Having considered the rival contentions of the parties, as per the material available on record,
BIADA has been constituted in the year 2003, before that, there were three Industrial Areas
Authority, first is North Bihar Industrial Area Authority, second is Darbhanga Industrial Area
Authority and third is Patna Industrial Area Authority, all were merged together and they have
reconstituted as Bihar Industrial Area Authority.
In earlier phase, as the financial condition of the BIADA was not good shape, they have not
implemented the recommendation of Sixth Pay Revision Commission Report though they continued
to grant the pay scale of Fifth Pay Revision Commission Report, but in the year 2006, after the
approval of the Finance Department as well as Industries Department, the recommendation of Sixth
Pay Revision has been implemented.
The question, in the present case, is as to whether the petitioner has rightly been given the pay scale
of Rs. 4000-6000/- or he should have been given pay scale of Rs. 5000-8000/-. It is Patna High
Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019 not in dispute that the petitioner when he he was
granted the pay scale of Rs. 1400-2600/- was the Junior Selection Grade pay scale, but he was not
holding the post of Head Typist and after implementation of the Sixth Pay Revision, the provision of
the Junior Selection Grade Typist/Senior Selection Grade Typist has been withdrawn and,
accordingly, the petitioner was made the typist as it is apparently clear from the representation that
as he was getting the pay scale of Rs. 1400-2600/-, he should be declared to be the Head Typist and,
accordingly, his pay scale should be fixed in the replacement scale. The representation itself consists
the answer that the petitioner was not holding the post of the Head Typist, but he was a simple
typist. The BIADA has specifically stated in the counter affidavit that the BIADA has not granted the
pay scale of Rs. 5000-8000/- and the scale of pay, which has been placed reliance by the petitioner
in Item No. 9 of the schedule, is meant for Head Typist and not made for the Typist and the pay
scale, which has been implemented, is attached with the letter no. 1667 dated 22.09.2006,
specifically shows that the replacement scale of the typist is Rs. 4000-6000/-.
In such view of the matter, this Court does not find any error in the pay fixation of the petitioner.

Patna High Court CWJC No.21787 of 2011 dt.17-04-2019 So far the prayer with regard to arrears of
pay w.e.f. 01.04.1997 onward is concerned, on this issue, the BIADA has taken a decision that on
account of financial condition, the benefit of arrears of salary would not be granted, though one
person has been granted the arrears, but the decision was taken later on, and that decision has not
been interfered with in C.W.J.C. No. 28 of 2015 which has been approved by the Division Bench in
2017 (2) PLJR 355, as has been informed to this Court that the matter is pending before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in which notices have been issued in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s). 19457-19458
of 2018.
In such view of the matter, the entitlement of the arrears of salary will be subject to the result of
aforesaid case. If any employee is granted the arrears of pay, certainly the petitioner will also be
entitled for the same.
With this observations and directions, this writ application is disposed of.
