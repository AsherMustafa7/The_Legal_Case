Sevika, the petitioner along with others applied. In the merit list
prepared, out of the four applicants, while the name of the
petitioner figured at serial no.1, the name of respondent no.9
was at serial no.3.
4. It is submitted by learned Senior counsel appearing
for the petitioner that the petitioner happens to be a resident of
the service area which is a necessary requirement for
appointment as an Anganwadi Sevika would be evident from the
residential certificate issued by the Block Development Officer
and brought on record as Annexure-5 to the application. It is
further submitted that the voter list of Cheriya Bariyarpur
Panchayat Legislative Assembly for the years 1966, 1988, 1995
as also 2009 would confirm the above fact. Further, the matter
of residency of the petitioner was inquired into by the Child
Development Project Officer, who submitted his report dated
11.2.2010
(Annexure-7) in favour of the petitioner. Even the District Magistrate while considering the appeal
filed by the petitioner against order of the District Programme Officer, in his order dated
13.1.2012/25.2.2012, taking into consideration the documents on record, came to the conclusion
that the petitioner is a resident of poshak kshetra and accordingly set aside the appointment of
respondent no.9 and directed the authorities to Patna High Court CWJC No.17083 of 2012
dt.07-10-2025 appoint the petitioner. It is finally submitted that the Divisional Commissioner in his
order dated 10.7.2012 erred in allowing the appeal filed by respondent no.9 and setting aside the
order of appointment of the petitioner.
5. In response, it is submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that the only issue arising in
the instant application is as to whether the petitioner whose name stood at serial no.1 in the merit
list is a resident of the poshak kshetra, a mandatory requirement for appointment on the post of
Anganwadi Sevika. It is submitted that taking into consideration the enquiry reports of the Rajasva
Karmchari and the Circle Inspector, the Divisional Commissioner had rightly come to the
conclusion that the petitioner was not a resident of the poshak kshetra and accordingly upholding
the order dated 4.3.2010 of the District Programme Officer had set aside the order dated
13.1.2012/25.2.2012 of the District Magistrate, Begusarai. It was submitted that there is no illegality

Malvika Kumari vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 7 October, 2025
in the order of the Divisional Commissioner and as such the instant application be dismissed.
6. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
7. The issue arising in the instant application relates to Patna High Court CWJC No.17083 of 2012
dt.07-10-2025 appointment on the post of Anganwadi Sevika for the newly created Anganwadi
Centre at Shyampur. Pursuant to the applications being invited by the respondents, the petitioner,
the respondent no.9 as also others filed their applications and in the merit list prepared while the
name of the petitioner figured at serial no.1, the name of the respondent no.9 figured at serial no.3.
It is not in dispute that for appointment as an Anganwadi Sevika, the applicant is required to be a
resident of the poshak kshetra /service area. A controversy having arisen as to whether the
petitioner was a resident of the poshak kshetra or not, the matter was enquired into by the Block
Development Officer, Chaurahi and the report contained in letter dated 29.1.2010 addressed to the
Sub-Divisional Officer, Manjhaul is on record as Annexure-4 to the application.
8. A perusal of the report submitted by the Block Development Officer, Chaurahi would show that he
called for and received the reports of Rajasva Karmchari and the Circle Inspector. Both of them have
stated in their reports that Mahesh Prasad Singh i.e. the husband of the petitioner and his brothers
Dinesh Prasad Singh and Ganesh Prasad Singh have two different houses. While a khaprail house is
situated North of the village road, the pucca house is to the South of Patna High Court CWJC
No.17083 of 2012 dt.07-10-2025 the road. On enquiry from the local people, it transpired that the
pucca house was constructed by Dinesh Prasad Singh, who happens to be posted as an Executive
Engineer in the Pollution Control Department, Jharkhand and Ganesh Prasad Singh who is also
posted as an Assistant in the same Department. The report of the Rajasva Karmchari further states
that so far as Mahesh Prasad Singh i.e. the husband of the petitioner is concerned, he has been
residing in the khaprail house. It was for the purpose of selection as Anganwadi Sevika that Mahesh
Prasad Singh moved into the house of his brother to enable the selection of the petitioner incorrectly
showing himself to be a resident of the poshak kshetra. The report of the Block Development Officer
further states that on-spot enquiry was also personally conducted by him and so far as the khaprail
house of the petitioner and her husband Mahesh Prasad Singh is concerned, the same is North of
the village road and does not come within the poshak kshetra /service area of the newly created
Anganwadi Centre of Shyampur.
9. In view of the categorical finding of the Block Development Officer as dealt with in detail in his
report dated 29.1.2010 (Annexure-4), the court finds no error in the order dated 10.7.2012 passed in
Service Appeal no.31 of 2012 by the Patna High Court CWJC No.17083 of 2012 dt.07-10-2025
learned Divisional Commissioner, Munger Division, Munger and no merit in the instant application.
10. The application is dismissed.
