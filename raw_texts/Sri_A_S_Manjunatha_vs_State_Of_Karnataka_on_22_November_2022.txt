WP No. 8095 of 2022
THIS WP IS FILED UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF THE
CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO CALL FOR THE
RECORDS OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE R2 DEPUTY
DIRECTOR, FOOD AD CIVIL SUPPLY AND LEGAL METROLOGY
DEPARTMENT DATED 01.12.2021 AT ANNEXURE - A AND AFTER
EXAMINING THE SAME, QUASH AND SET ASIDE THE ORDER
DATED 01.12.2021 PASSED BY THE R2 AT ANNEXURE - A AND
ETC.,
THIS PETITION, COMING ON FOR PRELIMINARY
HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
ORDER
The petitioner is before this Court calling in question an endorsement dated 01.12.2021, by which,
the application of the petitioner seeking transfer of authorization on compassionate grounds comes
to be rejected.
2. Heard Sri. H.C. Shivaramu, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, Sri. M. Vinod Kumar,
learned AGA appearing for the respondents and have perused the material on record.
3. Learned counsel, Sri. H.C. Shivaramu, appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
endorsement comes about on the ground that the age of the father was 73 years at the time when he
died and therefore, the authorization cannot be transferred. This is held to be contrary to law by the
judgment rendered by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in W.P.No.17048/2021 disposed on
20.09.2021, wherein it has held as follows:
"The subject matter of this Writ Petition is substantially similar to the one in
W.P.No.17131/2018 disposed off by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court on 8.2.2019,
copy whereof is at Annexure-F; at para Nos.9 & 10 of the order, said judgment reads
as under:
"From close scrutiny of the aforesaid paragraph, it is evident that in
W.P.No.22448/2015 which was decided by an order dated 21.09.2016, it has been
held that the requirement with regard to having passed SSLC and restriction of age is
not applicable when the transfer of authorization is sought on compassionate ground.
The aforesaid finding has admittedly attained finality and is binding on the
respondents as they have not challenged the same either by filing a review petition or
by filing a writ appeal. Therefore this Court finds no reason to take a different view.

10. In the result, the impugned endorsement dated 23.03.2018 is hereby quashed and
set aside and a direction is issued to respondent No.1 to take note of the application
filed by the petitioner and to consider the same for transfer of the authorization on
compassionate ground as expeditiously as possible, but not later than eight weeks
from the date on which a copy of this order is furnished."
2. The Division Bench of this Court in W.A.Nos.932-933/1974 between A.V.VINODA & ANOTHER
Vs. STATE OF KARNATAKA BY ITS COMMISSIONER & SECRETARY disposed of on 11.12.1974,
has held that the Court should treat like- cases alike and if relief is granted to a litigant, similar relief
cannot be denied to other similarly circumstanced litigant as well, there being no derogatory
circumstances.
In the above circumstances, this Writ Petition is allowed; impugned endorsement dated 03.09.2021
at Annexure-B is quashed; second respondent is directed to consider the petitioner's application
without reference to age and qualification.
Time for compliance is two months.
No costs."
4. In the light of the fact that the issue in the lis stands covered to the orders passed by the
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court (supra), I deem it appropriate to pass the following:
ORDER I. The writ petition is allowed. II. The endorsement dated 01.12.2021 stands
quashed.
III. Respondent No.2 is directed to reconsider the application of the petitioner
bearing in mind the observations in the course of the order within 12 weeks from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order.
