202554165300000142. The aforementioned revision was heard and dismissed by Additional
District Magistrate (Land Revenue)/ Deputy Director of Consolidation Mirzapur vide order dated
10.3.2025 directing the Consolidation Officer to decide the pending objection on merit within period
of one month. Hence this writ petition for the following reliefs:-
"(i) ssue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari calling for record and
quash the order dated 10.3.2025 passed by respondent no.2 in revision No. 664/2025
(Case No. 0142/2025) Computerized case No. 202554165300000142 (Aruna Devi Vs.

and the further proceeding pursuant thereto.
(ii) Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus and restrain the
contesting respondent from creating hindrance and interfering in the peaceful
possession of the petitioners over the land in dispute."
3. It is also material to mention that one Writ B No. 10571 of 1986 was filed by Smt. Gayatri Devi
arising out of proceeding under Section 5C (2) of U.P.C.H. Act. In the aforementioned Writ B No.
10571 of 1986, this Court vide interim order dated 20.9.1989 restrained the opposite party No. 15/
Surya Bali from making any pakaa construction over plot No. 355/1. Petitioners are vendees of
Surya Bali. The aforementioned writ petition was finally decided by this Court vide order dated
27.9.2023 with direction that Consolidation Officer shall decide the pending objection under Section
9A (2) of the U.P.C.H. Act within period of one year from the date of passing of the order dated
27.9.2023. More than one year has passed but till date the aforementioned objection under Section
9A (2) of the U.P.C.H. Act has not been decided rather this writ petition has been filed that title
objection cannot proceed.
4. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioners are bona fide purchaser of the plot in
question by way of registered sale deed, as such, the petitioner cannot be restrained from making
alteration in the construction which has been raised by the petitioner over the plot in question. He
further submitted that Consolidation Officer has not considered the objection of the petitioners in
proper manner and has illegally admitted the objection under Section 9A (2) of the U.P.C.H. Act
under the impugned order. He submitted that revision filed by petitioners has not been decided in
proper manner considering the ground set up in the revision. He submitted that impugned orders
passed by Consolidation Officer as well as Deputy Director of Consolidation should be set aside and
Consolidation Officer be directed to decide the maintainability question afresh.
5. On the other hand, Mr. S.D. Pandey, learned counsel for respondent no.4 submitted that title
objection filed in the year 1983 is still pending before Consolidation Officer, as such, no interference
is required in the matter. He further submitted that this Court while deciding the earlier writ
petition has directed the Consolidation Officer to decide the pending title objection within period of
one year but in spite of expiry of more than one and half year, the title objection has not been
decided due to the dilatory tactics adopted by the petitioners. He submitted that Consolidation
Officer under the impugned order has only admitted the objection, fixed a date for filing reply as
well as for framing issues in the objection but petitioners have challenged the order in revision and

now writ petition before this Court, as such, writ petition should be dismissed with heavy cost
against the petitioners.
6. I have considered the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perused the
records.
7. There is no dispute about the fact that title objection filed in the year 1983 under Section 9A (2) of
the U.P.C.H. Act in respect to plot No. 355/1 is still pending before respondent no.3, Consolidation
Officer Ram Bagh Mirzapur. There is also no dispute about the fact that this Court in the earlier writ
petition has directed the Consolidation Officer to decide the dispute within period of one year but in
spite of expiry of more than one and half year, the title objection has not been decided.
8. Consolidation Officer under the impugned order has only admitted the objection and fixed the
proceeding for filing reply by the opposite party as well as for framing issues which has been
maintained by the Deputy Director of Consolidation under the impugned revisional order. The
petitioners have misused the process of law by challenging the order of Consolidation Officer
admitting the title objection and fixing date for framing issues, as such, writ petition cannot be
entertained rather the writ petition should be dismissed with cost so that title objection can be
decided on merit.
9. It is material to mention that title objection filed in the year 1983 is still pending before
Consolidation Officer at the initial stage even after expiry of more than 42 years from the date of
filing of title objection.
10. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the conduct of the petitioner, the writ
petition is dismissed with cost of Rs. 15,000/-. The petitioners shall pay the cost of Rs. 15,000/- to
respondent no.4 (Girja Shankar) before the Consolidation Officer who shall record the fact of
payment of cost in the order sheet maintained by the Court of Consolidation Officer. Subject to
payment of cost by petitioners, Consolidation Officer shall conclude the proceeding of
aforementioned title objection within period of three months from the date of production of certified
copy of this order before Consolidation Officer.
