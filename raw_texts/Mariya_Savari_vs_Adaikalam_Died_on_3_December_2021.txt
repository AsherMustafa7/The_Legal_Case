2. The case of the Plaintiff, in a nutshell, as set out, in the plaint is as follows:-
a) The Defendants 1 and 3 are the son and daughter of the 2nd Defendant.
The suit property and other properties originally belonged to the ancestor of the Plaintiff,
Defendants and other persons. The suit property is a portion of a larger extent of SF.No.196 and a
joint patta was issued in the name of the Plaintiff, Defendant and others. In the revenue records, the
name of the Plaintiff, Defendants and others are entered into. On 06.04.1975, there was a family
arrangement between the Plaintiff, his brother Mariya Sandhiagu, one Mariyasavuri, grand father of
the Defendants 1 and 3 and the father in law of the 2nd Defendant, Mariya Savuri's brother
Sebastian, Savariyanatham, Philominathan and one Soosai Ammal, in the presence of the
Panchayatars, in respect of SF.No.196 and the property situated on the Western side of SF.No.196
and it was reduced into writing.
b) In the said family arrangement, the Plaintiff and his brother Mariya Sandhiyagu had agreed to
take the suit property and the property situated on the Northern side of it jointly to their share.
Thus, the Plaintiff and his brother Mariya Sandhiyagu became the owners of the suit property and
they have been in possession and enjoyment of the said properties. On 29.08.1975, at the instance of
the Plaintiff and his brother Mariya Sandhiyagu, there was another family arrangement took
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis place in the presence of Panchayatars in respect of the other
properties which are not the subject matter of earlier family arrangement, dated 06.04.1975 and the
suit, along with the suit property and the property situated on the Northern side of the suit property.
Since it was felt that the family arrangement made in the Panchayat on 29.08.1975 in respect of the
properties, which are not the subject matter of the family arrangement dated 06.04.1975, was not
correct, at the instance of the Plaintiff and his brother, in the presence of Panchayatars, a fresh
family arrangement was entered into on 24.07.1978 in respect of the other properties, which are not
the subject matter of the suit, but the subject matter of the earlier family arrangement dated
29.08.1975, along with the suit property, terminating the family arrangement dated 29.08.1975. In
the fresh family arrangement, the Plaintiff had agreed to take the Southern Portion, namely, the suit
property and his brother Mariya Sandhiyagu had agreed to take the Northern portion. Since then
Plaintiff has been in possession and enjoyment of the suit property. The Plaintiff is residing little far
from the suit property.
c) The Defendants demanded the Plaintiff to sell the suit property to them.
There were difference of opinion arose between the parties. The 1st Defendant had lodged a caveat
against the Plaintiff. On 05.05.2003, the Defendants trespassed into the suit property attempted to
cut the trees in the suit property. The Defendants have no right over the suit property. In such
circumstances, the suit has been filed, seeking permanent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
injunction, restraining the Defendants from interfering with the Plaintiff' peaceful possession and
enjoyment of the suit property and for costs.
3. The case of the Defendant, as set out in the written statement, filed by the 1st Defendant, is that
the description of the suit property and the rough plan are not correct. The acquisition of title as

Mariya Savari vs Adaikalam (Died) on 3 December, 2021
detailed in the plaint, the genealogy, the patta and chitta are false. The averments regarding the
family arrangement dated 06.04.1975 and possession of the Plaintiff are false. The family
arrangements dated 24.07.1978 and 29.08.1975 are also false. The Defendants never demanded the
Plaintiff to sell the suit property. The entire extent of Ac.01.11 cents in SF.No.196 was originally in
joint possession and enjoyment of Mariyasavuri and his brother Sabastian and patta was also
granted in their favour. The Defendants 1 to 3 and their ancestors in title have been in possession
and enjoyment of the suit property by way of inheritance. In such circumstances, the suit is liable to
be dismissed.
4. On the pleadings of the parties, issues were framed by the Trial Court. Before the Trial Court, on
the side of the Plaintiff, Ex.A1 to Ex.A16 were marked and PW.1 to PW.5 were examined. On the side
of the Defendants, Ex.B1 to Ex.B15 were marked and DW.1 was examined. The Trial Court had
decreed the suit. On the appeal, the lower appellate court had dismissed the appeal, confirming the
judgement and decree of the Trial Court. Aggrieved against the same, this Second Appeal has been
filed by the Defendants.
5. This Second Appeal was admitted, on the following substantial questions of law:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(a) Whether the courts below committed an error in law in not holding Ex.A5 and
Ex.A6 inadmissible as evidence for want of payment of proper stamp duty and for
want of registration?
(b) Whether the courts below committed an error in holding that the Respondent/
Plaintiff proved his title in respect of the suit property ignoring the tantalising stands
taken by him regarding the alleged partition in which he got the suit property allotted
to his share?
(c) Whether the courts below have committed an error in applying the principle
possession follows title to uphold the contention of the Respondent/ Plaintiff that he
is in possession of the suit property?
6. This Court heard the submissions of the learned counsel on either side.
7. The learned counsel for the Appellants has submitted that there is no document to prove that the
suit property belonged to the ancestor of the Plaintiff and that the suit property belonged to the
ancestor of the Defendants and that in the absence of valid evidence to prove the possession of the
Plaintiff, without considering Ex.B5, Ex.B8 and Ex.B9, which prove the possession of the
Defendants and erroneously relying on Ex.A5 and Ex.A6, the courts below have decreed suit and
that the suit, seeking mere injunction without the prayer for declaration of title, is not maintainable.
The learned counsel would rely on the decision reported in 2008 4 SCC 594 (Anathulla Sudhakar
Vs. P.Buchi Reddy).

8. The learned counsel for the Respondent would submit that since the lower appellate court did not
base its judgement on Ex.A5 and Ex.A6, the first two substantial questions of law are misconceived
and that in a suit for bare injunction, the question of title can be gone into incidentally, in the
absence of a prayer for declaration and that the Defendants did not state as to their
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ancestor, under whom they trace their title and possession and no
document of title in their name is produced by them and that the dispute is not with regard to the
title and that the Defendants did not discharge the burden of proof and that the Appellants have not
set out any ground as to how the concurrent findings of the court below are perverse and that no
substantial questions of law arises in this Second Appeal and hence, this Second Appeal is liable to
be dismissed. The learned counsel would rely on the decisions reported in AIR 1955 SC 481 (Sahu
Madho Das and others Vs. Mukand Ram and another), AIR 1976 SC 807 (Kale and others Vs.
Deputy Director of Consolidation), 1988 AIR SC 881 (Darshan Singh Vs. Samsher Singh), 1966 AIR
SC 292 (Tek Bahadur Bhujil Vs. Debi Singh Bhujil), 2007 4 MLJ 484 (Jansirani Vs. G.Loganathan),
2007 2 LW 445 (A.P.Kuppusamy Vs. P.Kumarapalayam Municipality), 1989 AIR SC 1809
(Corporation of the City of Bangalore Vs. Maiah and another), AIR 2008 SC 2033 (Anathula
Sudhakar Vs. P.Buchi Reddy), 2006 3 SCC 224 (G.Amalorpavam Vs. R.C.Diocese), AIR 2002
Madras 90 (T.Muniappa Vs. Perumiah), AIR 2008 SC 673 (Nopany Investments (P) Limited Vs.
Santokh Singh), 1971 84 LW 691 (V.A.Amiappa Nainar Vs. V.Annamalai Chettiar), 2005 6 SCC 441
(G.Mahalingappa Vs. G.M.Savitha), AIR 2003 SC 2985 (Sayeda Akhtar Vs. Abdul Ahad) and 1995 6
SCC 213 (Kashibai Vs. Parwatibai).
9. This Court considered the rival submissions of the learned counsel on either side and also perused
the materials available on record. For the sake of convenience, the parties herein after are referred
to as they were arrayed in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the suit.
10.The suit property, measuring 1.9 cents, is a portion of S.No.196, measuring 11 cents. The Plaintiff
claims possession over the suit property based on Ex.A5 and Ex.A6, unregistered family partition
deeds. Per contra, it is the stand of the Defendants that since Ex.A5 and Ex.A6 are unregistered
documents, they cannot be relied on and the Defendants claimed that they are in joint possession of
the suit property, having inherited the suit property through their ancestor.
11.The object of a family arrangement, wherein by consent of the parties, a matter is settled, is to
protect the family from long drawn litigation, which impairs the unity of the family. A family
arrangement can be inferred from a long course of dealing between the parties. The family
settlement must also be bona fide so as to resolve family disputes. Where bona fide disputes are
settled by a bona fide family arrangement, such a family arrangement is final and binding on the
parties to such settlement. It is well settled that a compromise or a family arrangement is based on
the assumption that there is an antecedent title of some sort in the parties. It is assumed that the
title claimed by the person receiving the property under the arrangement had always resided in him
or her.
12.The Trial Court had found that Ex.A5 and Ex.A6 cannot be totally ignored and relying on the said
documents, among other evidence, both oral and documentary, the Trial Court had decreed the suit,
by recording findings of facts.

13.Before the lower appellate court, the main attack of the Defendants was on Ex.A5 and Ex.A6.
Though the lower appellate court came to the conclusion that Ex.A5 and Ex.A6 are inadmissible in
evidence for want of registration, but relying on the other evidence both oral and documentary, it
had dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgement and decree of the Trial Court.
14.When both the courts below have concurrently recorded findings of facts arising from the
documents, in favour of the Plaintiff, regarding the possession and in the absence of warranting
compelling reasons, the same cannot be interfered with in this second appeal.
15.It is well settled that even in a suit for mere injunction, the question of title can also be gone into
incidentally and as such, a suit for bare injunction without a prayer for declaration of title is
maintainable. It would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each and every case.
16.In this case, though it is the contention of the Appellants that the suit is not maintainable without
the relief of declaration, in the written statement filed by the Defendants, they have not raised any
such specific plea to that effect. The courts below, after analysing the entire evidence both oral and
documentary and keeping in mind the well settled proposition, while affirming the possession of the
suit property in favour of the Plaintiff, have rightly recorded its findings. Since the Plaintiff has
established his case by valid evidence, there was no necessity to seek a relief of declaration. The
court below have held that the Plaintiff has proved his case regarding possession
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis by valid evidence and the Defendants have failed to trace their
title and possession, by producing clinching and valid evidence. In view of the above, the impugned
judgements of the courts below do not warrant any interference by this Court, keeping in view the
principles and object of a family arrangement.
17.In fine, this Second Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
