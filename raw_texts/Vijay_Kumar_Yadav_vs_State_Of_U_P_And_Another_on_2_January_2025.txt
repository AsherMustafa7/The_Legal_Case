Case :- APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 17849 of 2024
Applicant :- Vijay Kumar Yadav
Opposite Party :- State of U.P. and Another
Counsel for Applicant :- Anup Kumar Pandey,Sanjay Srivastava
Counsel for Opposite Party :- G.A.
Hon'ble Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal,J.
1. Heard Sri Manish Kumar Pandey, learned counsel holding brief of Sri Anup Kumar Pandey along
with Sri Sanjay Srivastava, learned counsel for the applicant and Sri Rajeev Kumar Singh, learned
AGA for the State.
2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the entire criminal proceedings
including summoning order dated 19.10.2023 in Complaint Case No.14209 of 2022, under
Section-138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act, 1881'), Police

of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kushinagar at Padrauna.

Vijay Kumar Yadav vs State Of U.P. And Another on 2 January, 2025
S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Vs. Neeta Bhalla & Another in Criminal Appeal No.664 of 2002 decided
on 20.09.2005. It is further submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that cheque in question
was not issued in discharge of any liability and same was a missing cheque. In support of his
contention, learned counsel for the applicant has also relied upon the judgement of Raj Kumar
Khurana Vs. State of (NCT of Delhi) & Another in Criminal Appeal No.913 of 2009, arising out of
SLP (Crl.) No.8059 of 2007 decided on 05.05.2009. Therefore, no liability u/s 138 of the Act, 1881 is
attracted. It is also submitted by learned counsel for the applicant that though applicant is a resident
of Kushinagar but at present, he has been residing at Kanpur, therefore, the court having
jurisdiction in district- Kushinagar should have conducted enquiry as required by Section 202
Cr.P.C.
4. Per contra, learned AGA has opposed the prayer on the ground that all the pleas raised by the
applicant are disputed questions of fact which cannot be a ground to quash the impugned
proceeding, at this stage.
5. Considering the submission of parties and on perusal of record, it appears from the impugned
summoning order that after stating the facts of the complaint as well as statement, the court below
after recording its satisfaction summoned the applicant on the ground that cheque signed by the
applicant was returned by the bank with the endorsement 'insufficiency of fund' which prima facie
attracts the liability u/s 138 of the Act, 1881. The Apex Court in the recent judgement in the case of
Sharif Ahmad & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another reported in 2024 LiveLaw SC 337 had observed
in paragraph no.17 that Section 204 Cr.P.C. does not mandate the Magistrate to explicitly state the
reason for issue of the summons. Therefore, no detailed reason is required to be mentioned in the
summoning order.
6. So far as the contention of learned counsel for the applicant that cheque in question was a missing
cheque regarding which the applicant has already informed the police is concerned, same is
disputed question of fact that can be raised by the applicant during trial. As in the present case,
cheque has been returned with the endorsement 'fund insufficient' and had it been the missing
cheque, applicant would have instructed the bank for stopping the payment of cheque. Therefore,
judgement of Raj Kumar Khurana (supra) relied upon the applicant does not apply in the present
case. Apex Court in the case of Laxmi Dyechem Vs. State of Gujarat & Others reported in (2012) 13
SCC 375 as well as in the case of Lafarge Aggregates And Concrete India Private Ltd. Vs. Sukarsh
Azad And Another reported in 2014 (13) SCC 779 has observed that in case dishonour of cheque for
insufficient fund or for any other reason, accused is free to take all plea during trial but proceeding
cannot be quashed on this ground. Paragraph nos.16.2 and 17 of Laxmi Dyechem (supra) as well as
paragraph no.8 of Lafarge Aggregates (supra) are being quoted as under:
?16.2.There may indeed be situations where a mismatch between the signatories on
the cheque drawn by the drawer and the specimen available with the bank may result
in dishonour of the cheque even when the drawer never intended to invite such a
dishonour. We are also conscious of the fact that an authorised signatory may in the
ordinary course of business be replaced by a new signatory ending the earlier
mandate to the bank. Dishonour on account of such changes that may occur in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106483724/ 2
Vijay Kumar Yadav vs State Of U.P. And Another on 2 January, 2025
course of ordinary business of a company, partnership or an individual may not
constitute an offence by itself because such a dishonour in order to qualify for
prosecution under Section 138 shall have to be preceded by a statutory notice where
the drawer is called upon and has the opportunity to arrange the payment of the
amount covered by the cheque. It is only when the drawer despite receipt of such a
notice and despite the opportunity to make the payment within the time stipulated
under the statute does not pay the amount that the dishonour would be considered a
dishonour constituting an offence, hence punishable. Even in such cases, the
question whether or not there was a lawfully recoverable debt or liability for
discharge whereof the cheque was issued would be a matter that the trial court will
examine having regard to the evidence adduced before it and keeping in view the
statutory presumption that unless rebutted the cheque is presumed to have been
issued for a valid consideration.
17.In the case at hand, the High Court relied upon a decision of this Court inVinod
Tanna case[(2002) 7 SCC 541 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1825] in support of its view. We have
carefully gone through the said decision which relies upon the decision of this Court
inElectronics Trade & Technology Development Corpn. Ltd.[(1996) 2 SCC 739 : 1996
SCC (Cri) 454] The view expressed by this Court inElectronics Trade & Technology
Development Corpn. Ltd.[(1996) 2 SCC 739 : 1996 SCC (Cri) 454] that a dishonour of
the cheque by the drawer after issue of a notice to the holder asking him not to
present a cheque would not attract Section 138 has been specifically overruled
inModi Cements Ltd. case[(1998) 3 SCC 249 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 252] . The net effect is
that dishonour on the ground that the payment has been stopped, regardless whether
such stoppage is with or without notice to the drawer, and regardless whether the
stoppage of payment is on the ground that the amount lying in the account was not
sufficient to meet the requirement of the cheque, would attract the provisions of
Section 138.
8.The object of bringing Sections 138 to 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on
statute appears to be to inculcate faith in the efficacy of banking operations and
credibility in transacting business of negotiable instruments. Despite several
remedies, Section 138 of the Act is intended to prevent dishonesty on the part of the
drawer of negotiable instrument to draw a cheque without sufficient funds in his
account maintained by him in a bank and induces the payee or holder in due course
to act upon it. Therefore, once a cheque is drawn by a person of an account
maintained by him for payment of any amount or discharge of liability or debt or is
returned by a bank with endorsement like (i) refer to drawer, (ii) exceeds
arrangements, and (iii) instruction for stop payment and like other usual
endorsement, it amounts to dishonour within the meaning of Section 138 of the Act.
Therefore, even after issuance of notice if the payee or holder does not make the
payment within the stipulated period, the statutory presumption would be of
dishonest intention exposing to criminal liability.?

7. So far as the last contention of learned counsel for the applicant that he has been presently
residing at Kanpur, therefore, while issuing summons, the court having jurisdiction in district-
Kushinagar should have conducted enquiry as required by Section 202 Cr.P.C. is concerned, is also
misconceived as court below has recorded its prima facie satisfaction before issuing summons to the
applicant.
8. From the perusal of complaint, it is clear that the address of the applicant has been mentioned as
Kushinagar with further observation that applicant has presently been residing at Kanpur, therefore,
it is not mandatory for Magistrate to conduct detailed enquiry as required u/s 202 Cr.P.C.
9. In view of the above, this court does not find any illegality in the impugned proceeding as well as
in the impugned summoning order.
10. Accordingly, the present application is rejected.
