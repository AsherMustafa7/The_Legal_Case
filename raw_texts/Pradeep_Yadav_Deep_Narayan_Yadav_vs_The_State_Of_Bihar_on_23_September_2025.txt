CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SUDHIR SINGH
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJESH KUMAR VERMA
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SUDHIR SINGH) Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of
2025 dt.23-09-2025 Date : 23-09-2025 The present criminal appeal has been preferred under
Section 413 of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita against judgment of acquittal dated
30.05.2025 passed by the learned District and Additional Sessions Judge-XV, Bhagalpur in Sessions
Trial No. 253 of 2024, arising out of Jagdishpur P.S. Case No. 423 of 2020, whereby Respondent
Nos. 2 to 7 have been acquitted by the learned Trial Court from the charge of Sections 147, 148,
302/149, 341/149 and 323/149 of Indian Penal Code.
2. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 12.12.2020 at about 08:00 p.m., the informant along
with his son Shekhar and Manish went to Jagdishpur for purchasing medicine for his son Manish
Yadav. At the time of return, when they reached at Chhoti Koyala near Pokhar Mor then, Bhairo
Yadav, Sonu Yadav, Durga Yadav, Ashok Yadav, Arvind Yadav, Siddhu Yadav, all armed with
hockey, rifle, country-made pistol, lathi and iron rod surrounded them. Bhairo Yadav ordered the
aforementioned accused persons to kill the informant and his son Shekhar Yadav and Manish
Yadav. They brutally assaulted the informant and his sons with the said weapons. When the
informant raised alarm, then they tied their hands and after seeing persons on tractor, the accused
persons fled away threatening to face dire consequences if they inform the Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 Police. All sustained injuries but Shekhar Yadav was
grievously injured and was admitted to J.L.N.M.C.H., Bhagalpur where he died during the course of
the treatment.
3. On the basis of fardbeyan of the informant, Jagdishpur P.S. Case No. 423 of 2020 was instituted
under Sections 147, 148, 302/149, 341/149 and 323/149 of Indian Penal Code and investigation was
taken up by the Police. The Police after investigation submitted charge-sheet against Respondent
Nos. 2 to 7 and, accordingly, cognizance was taken. Thereafter, the case was committed to the Court
of Sessions. Charges were framed against the accused persons to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed to be tried.
4. During the trial, the prosecution examined altogether twenty one prosecution witnesses i.e. PW1-
Gainu Yadav, PW2- Birbal Harijan, PW3- Vipin Kumar Das, PW4- Rajesh Kumar @ Rajesh Paswan,

No. 394/20. No witness has been examined on behalf of the defence. After closure of
prosecution evidence, the statements of the accused persons were recorded under
Section 313 Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court has acquitted the
accused persons.
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025
5. The learned Trial Court, on the basis of the materials available on record and the evidence
produced before the Court, acquitted the accused persons observing that the there is a contradiction
in the statement of the informant and the evidence of the witnesses. Further, the learned Trial
Court, after analyzing the facts and the evidence produced during the trial, has observed that due to
previous enmity, the accused persons have been stated to be involved in the alleged incident.
6. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that when the cause of death could not be
determined by the Doctor in the post mortem report, then such order of acquittal cannot be
sustainable in law because deceased died due to assault by accused persons.
7. The learned counsel for the State has submitted that there is no perversity in the judgment of the
learned trial court, and the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused before the learned
Trial Court. Further, there is no such medical document produced by prosecution to show that
deceased was taken to hospital for treatment after the alleged occurrence which took place on
13.12.2020 at 01:30a.m.
8. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and the State and have also gone through the
records of the case. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025
9. The sole question that requires consideration by this Court is whether the impugned judgment
requires any interference by this Court.
10. Upon meticulous examination of the evidence presented and the circumstances surrounding the
case, this Court observes several significant deficiencies in the prosecution's case which collectively
casts substantial doubt on the veracity of the allegations and the guilt of the accused.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/90563703/ 3
Pradeep Yadav @ Deep Narayan Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 23 September, 2025
11. The alleged occurrence is said to have taken place at approximately 8:00 PM and, given the
timing of the incident, it would have been relatively dark and visibility would have been poor.
Despite this, the prosecution has failed to disclose any source of identification of the accused
persons. No witness has stated how they identified the accused under low-light conditions nor any
independent method of identification (such as a lamp, vehicle light, or prior knowledge) has been
brought on record. The identification of an accused is a fundamental requirement for establishing
culpability and where no credible source or circumstances of identification are provided, the
testimony regarding identification becomes inherently unreliable.
In the present case, the absence of such critical information regarding identification, especially
given that the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 incident occurred at
night renders the prosecution's case doubtful. The Court, therefore, places significant weight on this
lacuna while assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the prosecution story.
12. The First Information Report (FIR) and the testimonies of the witnesses during trial exhibit
material contradictions. While the FIR contains general allegations, the witnesses, during trial, have
sought to attribute specific acts to the accused persons. Additionally, the FIR mentions that the
parties had gone to purchase medicine whereas during trial, it was stated that they had gone to
purchase vegetables. Such discrepancies suggest that the prosecution's case has evolved during the
trial which is impermissible and casts doubt on the credibility of the witnesses.
13. The medical evidence presented is inconsistent with the prosecution's narrative. Doctor (PW18)
opined that the deceased might have died due to excessive bleeding resulting from a fracture of the
left hip bone. However, the prosecution has failed to produce any medical document or hospital
record showing that the deceased was admitted for treatment and subsequently succumbed to
injuries inflicted by the accused. The absence of such corroborative medical evidence further
undermines the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 prosecution's case.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Thaman Kumar v. State of U.T. Chandigarh, reported in (2003) 6
SCC 380, has observed in Para-16 of judgment as under:-
"16. The conflict between oral testimony and medical evidence can be of varied
dimensions and shapes. There may be a case where there is total absence of injuries
which are normally caused by a particular weapon. There is another category where
though the injuries found on the victim are of the type which are possible by the
weapon of assault, but the size and dimension of the injuries do not exactly tally with
the size and dimension of the weapon. The third category can be where the injuries
found on the victim are such which are normally caused by the weapon of assault but
they are not found on that portion of the body where they are deposed to have been
caused by the eyewitnesses. The same kind of inference cannot be drawn in the three
categories of apparent conflict in oral and medical evidence enumerated above. In the
first category it may legitimately be inferred that the oral evidence regarding assault
having been made from a particular weapon is not truthful. However, in the second
and third categories no such inference can straight away be drawn. The manner and
method of assault, the position of the victim, the resistance offered by him, the

opportunity available to the witnesses to see the occurrence like their distance,
presence of light and many other similar factors will have to be taken into
consideration in judging the reliability of ocular testimony."
14. The FIR was lodged on 13.12.2020 at 17:45 p.m., whereas the post mortem was conducted on
13.12.2020 at 11:40 Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 a.m.. This
discrepancy raises serious questions about the authenticity of the FIR and the sequence of events.
15. The cumulative effect of the aforementioned deficiencies namely; absence of identification,
contradictions between the FIR and trial testimonies, inconsistencies in medical evidence, and
discrepancies in the timing of the FIR and post mortem renders the prosecution's case highly
doubtful.
16. We find that the findings recorded by the learned Trial Court do not suffer from any illegality
and perversity. In a criminal case, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the
accused beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Wherever, any doubt is cast upon the case of the
prosecution, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.
17. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the Appellate Court has to examine is whether the
finding of the learned court below is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the Appellate Court
comes to the finding that the grounds on which the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of
appeal against acquittal is limited considering the fact that the legal presumption about the
innocence of the accused is further strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is
imperative to consider the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrinal Das Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 vs. State of Tripura, reported in (2011) 9
SCC 479, paragraphs 13 & 14 of which read as under:-
"13. It is clear that in an appeal against acquittal in the absence of perversity in the
judgment and order, interference by this Court exercising its extraordinary
jurisdiction, is not warranted. However, if the appeal is heard by an appellate court, it
being the final court of fact, is fully competent to reappreciate, reconsider and review
the evidence and take its own decision. In other words, the law does not prescribe any
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and the appellate court
is free to arrive at its own conclusion keeping in mind that acquittal provides for
presumption in favour of the accused. The presumption of innocence is available to
the person and in criminal jurisprudence every person is presumed to be innocent
unless he is proved guilty by the competent court. If two reasonable views are
possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb
the findings of acquittal.
14. There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence
upon which the order of acquittal is found and to come to its own conclusion. The
appellate court can also review the conclusion arrived at by the trial court with
respect to both facts and law. While dealing with the appeal against acquittal

preferred by the State, it is the duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire
evidence on record and only by giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the
judgment of acquittal. An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there
are "compelling and substantial reasons" for doing so. If the order is "clearly
unreasonable", it is a compelling reason for interference.........."
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 In Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar
Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in 2024 SCC Online SC 561, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, after
referring to relevant precedents, has observed as follows:
"39. Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the scope of interference by an appellate
Court for reversing the judgment of acquittal recorded by the trial Court in favour of
the accused has to be exercised within the four corners of the following principles:
(a) That the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity;
(b) That the same is based on a misreading/omission to consider material evidence
on record;
(c) That no two reasonable views are possible and only the view consistent with the
guilt of the accused is pos-
sible from the evidence available on record.
40. The appellate Court, in order to interfere with the judgment of acquittal would have to record
pertinent findings on the above factors if it is inclined to reverse the judgment of acquittal rendered
by the trial Court."
18. Thus, an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only for compelling and substantial reasons.
In case if the order is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference. But where
there is no perversity in the finding of the impugned judgment of acquittal, the Appellate Court must
not take a different view only because another view is possible. It is because the Trial Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.810 of 2025 dt.23-09-2025 Court has the privilege of seeing the demeanour
of witnesses and, therefore, its decision must not be upset in absence of strong and compelling
grounds.
19. In view of the above, we do not find any illegality and perversity in the findings recorded by the
Trial Court.
20. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
21. Pending application(s), if any, shall also stand disposed of.

22. Before parting with this judgment, the Court places on record its appreciation for the valuable
assistance rendered by learned counsel Ms. Kiran Kumari in effectively presenting the matter.
