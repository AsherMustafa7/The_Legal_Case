3. Earlier, on 02.12.2024 following order was passed:
"1. Heard Mr. Pawan Kumar Shukla, learned counsel for the applicants, Mr. Harish
Chandra, learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 and Mr. Amit Singh Chauhan,
learned counsel for the State.
2. The present 482 Cr.P.C. application has been filed to quash the cognizance order
dated 13.06.2022 as well as entire proceedings of Criminal Case No. 37969 of 2022
(State Vs. Sonu and others), arising out of Case Crime No. 20 of 2022, under Sections
498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station Mahila Thana, District
Moradabad, pending in the court of Civil Judge (Jr. Div.),/ F.T.C., Crime Against
Women, Moradabad in pursuance of compromise deed dated 19.09.2024.
3. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the parties have amicably settled
their dispute and a compromise has been entered into between the parties. He
further submits that a case under Section 13 B of the Hindu Marriage Act has also
been decided and permanent alimony of Rs.10,50,000/- has been received by
opposite party no.2 and the same has been acknowledged by counsel for opposite
party no.2. The copy of the said compromise/mutual deed, filed before the court
below, is annexed as Annexure No. 6 to this application. Therefore, continuance of
proceedings against the applicants would be a futile exercise and wastage of time of
the Court and will be abuse of process of law. Hence, proceedings of the aforesaid
case be quashed in the light of law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303.
4. Learned AGA as well as learned counsel for opposite party no.2 also does not
dispute the correctness of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
applicants.
5. Whether a compromise has taken place or not can at best be ascertained by the
court, where the proceedings are pending, after ensuring the presence of the parties
before it.
6. In view of the above, both the parties are directed to appear before the court below
along with copy of compromise deed as well as a certified copy of this order within a
two week from today. It is expected that the trial court may fix a date for the
verification of the compromise and after ensuring the presence of parties, pass an
appropriate order with respect to the same in accordance with law, after hearing the
informant, as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of four weeks from
today. While passing the order verifying the compromise, the concerned court shall
also record the statement of the parties as to whether all the terms and conditions
mentioned in the original compromise deed, so filed, have been fulfilled or not?

case."

has been brought on record along with the letter of Civil Judge (J.D.), Moradabad dated 03.01.2025,
as is evident from the office report dated 01.02.2025.
5. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that since the compromise entered between the
parties has been verified by the court concerned, the entire proceedings of the aforesaid criminal
case may be quashed by this Court.
6. Learned counsel for opposite parties accepts that the parties have entered into a compromise and
the copy of the same has also been enclosed alongwith verification order, they have no objection, if
the proceedings in the aforesaid case are quashed.
7. Before proceeding further it shall be apt to make a brief reference to the following cases:-
1. B.S. Joshi and others Vs. State of Haryana and Another; (2003)4 SCC 675;
2. Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation; (2008) 9 SCC 677;

4. Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab; (2012); 10 SCC 303; and
5. Narindra Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab; ( 2014) 6 SCC 466,
8. In the aforesaid judgments, the Apex Court has categorically held that compromise can be made
between the parties even in respect of certain cognizable and non compoundable offences. Reference
may also be made to the decision given by this Court in Shaifullah and Others Vs. State of U.P. &
Another; 2013 (83) ACC 278, in which the law expounded by the Apex court in the aforesaid cases
has been explained in detail.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as noted hereinabove, and also the
submissions made by the counsel for the parties, the court is of the considered opinion that no
useful purpose shall be served by prolonging the proceedings of the above mentioned criminal case
as the parties have already settled their dispute.
