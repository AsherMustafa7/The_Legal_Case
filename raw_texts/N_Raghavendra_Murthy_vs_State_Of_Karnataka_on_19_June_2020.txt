N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
ORDER
I. Facts of the case:-
(i) The petitioners in most of these cases claim
to be the owners and in possession of properties and trace their title from the Maharaja of Mysore.
The petitioners rely on sale deeds, consequent entries in the records of the Mysore City Municipal
Corporation amongst other records to evidence their title, possession and enjoyment. It is only in
W.P.No.25592/2015, the Royal Family themselves are before this Court challenging the action of
Deputy Commissioner.
(ii) Petitioners are aggrieved by the orders dated 26.05.2015 passed by the Deputy Commissioner in
RRT Nos.540/2014-2015, 541/2014-2015 and 542/2014- 2015 whereby it has been held that the
lands in which the petitioners claim interest and rights were originally 'B Kharab' i.e. Government
lands reserved for public purpose, and accordingly consequential directions were issued to the
Tahsildar to cancel the Kathas, i.e. mutation entries standing in the name of the petitioners.
(iii) It is stated that the Governor General of India had accepted the offer of Sri Jayachamarajendra
Wode yar, the Maharaja of Mysore to accede to the Indian Dominion on 16.08.1947 as per the
Instrument of Accession1. Pursuant to the Instrument of Accession, an agreement was entered into
on 23.01.1950 between the Governor General of India and the Maharaja of Mysore2. As per Article
II (2) of the agreement, the Maharaja of Mysore was required to furnish to the Government of India
an inventory of all moveable and immovable properties, which would be held by him as private
property.
1 (Annexure-U in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015) 2 Annexure V1 in W.P.No.25462-25497/2015
(iv) As per the list of immovable properties that was submitted3 the whole of Kurubarahalli Village
in Survey No.4, measuring 1563 acres 31 guntas, including tank bed area with an exception of Survey
Nos.1, 2 and 3; property in Survey No.41 of Aalanahalli Village measuring 178 acres 32 guntas, and
property in Survey No.39 of Chowdahalli Village measuring 259 acres 27 guntas, were described as
private properties held by the Maharaja of Mysore as on 26.01.1950.
(v) The said list of properties referred to above having been furnished to the Government of India,
the same came to be acknowledged and accepted by the Government of India in terms of Article II of
the agreement, to be the private property belonging to the Maharaja of Mysore.4 Annexure-W in
W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015 4 Annexure-V in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015
(vi) Subsequently it appears that while the Maharaja of Mysore has retained some of the lands, the
remaining portions of land came to be alienated eventually coming into the possession of the
petitioners. It is not in dispute that many of the properties that have been sold by the Maharaja of
Mysore has been the subject matter of real estate development, and Mysore Urban Development
Authority (MUDA) had approved the development plans and Mysore City Corporation had approved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 60
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
plans for construction, and Katha entries had also been effected by Mysore City Corporation as well
as the revenue authorities in the names of the predecessors-in-title of the petitioners and
subsequently the petitioners.
(vii) It is stated that the Government having been appraised of the necessity of removal of the entry
of 'B Kharab' in the revenue and survey records of the lands which are subject matter of the present
dispute had directed the Authorities to initiate necessary proceedings in that regard. Accordingly,
the Deputy Commissioner conducted an enquiry under Sections 67(2) and 136(3) of the Karnataka
Land Revenue Act, 1964 ('K.L.R. Act' for brevity) and arrived at the conclusion vide the order dated
20.06.20125 that the aforementioned lands were not 'Government lands' and had directed dropping
of further proceedings - relating to the enquiry under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act. Consequently
there was an order to set aside the entries treating the land as "Government B Kharab" as found in
Column No.11 of the RTC pertaining to the lands of the petitioners.
(viii) It is stated that the very same Deputy Commissioner had subsequently cancelled the earlier
order dated 20.06.2012 pursuant to the direction of the Government dated 18.08.2012 contained in
the letter addressed by the Principal Secretary, Revenue (Annexure-AJ in
W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015) Department to the Deputy Commissioner6. In fact, the said letter
contains reference to an endorsement of the Deputy Chief Minister on the representation of the
Member of Legislative Council directing holding of an enquiry under Section 25 of the K.L.R. Act.
(ix) Said order of the Deputy Commissioner was assailed in W.P. Nos.47983-47984/2012 and
connected matters, wherein this Court by order dated 12.12.2012 while setting aside the impugned
order of the Deputy Commissioner on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice,
disposed off the writ petitions observing as follows:
"7...If the respondent No.2 proposes to withdraw or vary the order, dated 20.06.2012
(Annexure-G), the respondent No.2 has to issue the notice to the petitioners and hear
them and then take a decision in the matter."
Annexure-AK in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015
(x) Consequent upon such direction, fresh proceedings came to be initiated and the impugned
orders of the Deputy Commissioner dated 26.05.2015 came to be passed reconsidering the earlier
order dated 20.06.2012 while holding that the lands in the aforesaid survey numbers of
Kurubarahalli, Aalanahalli and Chowdahalli were originally 'B Kharab' lands reserved for public
purpose, with a consequential direction to the Tahsildar to cancel the Katha entries standing in the
names of the petitioners. It is these orders of the Deputy Commissioner dated 26.05.2015 passed in
R.R.T.Nos.540/2014-2015, 541/2014-2015 and 542/2014-2015 that have been challenged in the
present proceedings.
II. Contentions of petitioners:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 61
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
(A) Sri B.V.Acharya, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri C.K.Venkatesh for
the petitioner in Writ Petition No.25592/2015 has submitted as follows:-
(i) That the order dated 20.06.2012 passed by the Deputy Commissioner at the first
instance could not have been recalled and fresh orders as impugned herein be passed,
which would in effect result in review of the earlier order and such power could not
be claimed to inhere unless it was specifically conferred under the statute and in the
present case, the K.L.R. Act does not confer such power.
(ii) That the proceedings initiated under Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act does not permit
enquiry where title is vested in a private individual. In such a case, the appropriate
remedy would be to file a suit before the Civil Court.
(iii) That the order of the Deputy
Commissioner being one without
jurisdiction, the court could entertain the writ petition directly without relegating the
parties to the alternative remedy provided for under the relevant statute. (B) Sri
S.S.Naganand, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Sriranga. S for the
petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.28082-28085/2015 and 28853/2015 has submitted
as follows.-
(i) As the dispute relates to the assertion that the properties are the private properties
of the Maharaja of Mysore in terms of the Instrument of Accession and agreement,
Article 363 of the Constitution of India creates a bar to enquire into the disputes
arising from such agreement.
The remedy as against the impugned orders must be worked out as specified under Article II(3) of
the agreement by way of arbitration.
(ii) As the sale deeds were executed long back and consequent mutation entries effected, the right to
proceed against any person relying on such document or revenue entry stands extinguished as per
Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963 by inaction to initiate proceedings within the time prescribed
under law. Alternatively, it was contended that the power conferred on the Authority under a statute
must be exercised within a reasonable period of time, unlike as in the present case where
proceedings have been initiated after several decades of unreasonable lapse of time.
(C) Sri G.Krishnamurthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Ms.Aparna.N for petitioners in Writ
Petition Nos.26814-26815/2015, 26816/2015, 27488-27492/2015 & 27494-27495/2015,
28456/2015 has submitted as follows:-

N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
(i) The impugned order passed pursuant to the direction of the Government dated
18.08.2012 was an order passed under dictation and must be set aside on this ground
alone.
Learned Senior Counsel has reiterated the submissions made by the other learned Senior Advocates.
(D) Sri Dharmesh. A., the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.Nos.26062/2015 and
26063- 26064/2015 has submitted as follows.-
(i) That the Maharaja of Mysore had in fact executed a sale deed with respect to the land in the
Survey No.4 of Kurubarahalli Village in favour of Government by way of a sale deed dated
20.06.1951. Accordingly, by its previous actions it had affirmed the ownership of the Maharaja of
Mysore as regards the property in Survey No.4 of Kurubarahalli Village. Hence, the Government is
estopped from taking any stand that the land in question belonged to it. (E) Sri R.S.Ravi, learned
counsel appearing for the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.25462-25497/2015, 28759-28764/2015,
33192-33194/2015, 1900/2018 and 44533/2018 has submitted as follows.-
(i) That the respondent State cannot at this belated period of time turn around and contend to the
contrary that the property in dispute belongs to the State, when once title of the Maharaja in the
properties in question has been accepted.
(ii) That the lands in Aalanahalli and Kurubarahalli Villages were acquired for formation of 'Body
Guard lines', 'Eastern Extension', and 'Palace purposes' as per the notifications.7 That the
Government of Karnataka had acquired land in 'Karanji Kere' as per notification dated 01.03.1977
which was a part of the extent of 1563.31 acres of Survey No.4 of Kurubarahalli Village.8 That the
Government has acquired 69.11 acres of land in Survey No.4 of Kurubarahalli Village for shooting
area and riding school, showing the names of persons who had purchased the land from the
Maharaja of Mysore as per the 7 02.10.1913, 19.01.1915, 22.08.1917 & 06.03.1919 (Annexures-P, P1,
P2 and P3 in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015). 8 Annexure-Z in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015.
notifications published9. Accordingly, the question of acquisition proceedings having been initiated
showing the names of private persons as owners would not have arisen if the lands belonged to the
State. Hence, it is contended that the State is estopped from now contending that the very same
lands were the property belonging to it. (F) Sri Anandarama. K, the learned counsel appearing for
petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.27761- 27762/2015, 35324/2015 & 44691-44693/2015 has
submitted as follows:-
(i) That a perusal of RTCs10 would indicate that the land has been assessed to tax.
If that were to be so, it is clear that 'Kharab' referred to in Rule 21 of the 9 02.09.1970, Annexure-AF
in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015. 10 Annexure-F in W.P.Nos.27761-27762/2015.
Karnataka Land Revenue Rules, 1966 ('K.L.R. Rules') is that property which is not assessed to land
revenue and as the revenue entries would indicate that properties are assessed to tax, the question
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 63
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
of assertion of State that land is 'B Kharab' cannot be accepted.
(G) Learned Senior Counsel, Sri Ashok Haranahalli along with Sri Vinayaka.B has also advanced
arguments raising the contentions as noticed above.
(H) Ms.S.R.Anuradha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Sri Ajay Shankar Rao, learned
counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition No.36304/2015 & 2830-2833/2016 and other learned
counsel appearing for petitioners in other writ petitions have reiterated the submissions made by
the learned Senior Counsel referred to above. III Contentions of respondent - State:-
The learned Additional Advocate General, Sri M.Dhyan Chinnapppa along with Sri
M.A.Subramani, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing on behalf of
respondent - State has submitted as follows.-
(i) That the Deputy Commissioner while passing the impugned orders has exercised
the power of procedural review that is available even in the absence of specific
conferment of power of review under the statute.
(ii) That as no notice was issued to the Tahsildar while passing of the order at the first
instance on 20.06.2012, the Deputy Commissioner was justified in invoking such
procedural power of review.
(iii) That the impugned orders passed under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act is
amenable to the remedy of an appeal under Section 67(3) of the K.L.R. Act and
hence, the petitioners ought to be relegated to avail the alternative remedy of
challenging the impugned orders before the civil court.
(iv) That the bar under Article 363 of the Constitution of India would operate only if
the parties litigating are the Maharaja and the State. In the present case, as the
petitioners are claiming derivative title from the Maharaja and by conveyance in their
favour, they have derived independent title and accordingly the bar under Article 363
of the Constitution of India would not be applicable.
IV. Points for consideration:-
(a) Power of review enabling reconsideration:
It is the contention of the State that the order of the Deputy Commissioner dated
20.06.2012 at the first instance was passed without taking note of the views of
Tahsildar and without taking note of revenue/survey records including Aakarbandh,
re-survey Tippani which revealed classification of land as 'B Kharab'. It is further
contended that the power of procedural review is inherent and can be traced to
Section 25 of the K.L.R. Act and could be invoked to prevent abuse of court process.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 64
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
(ii) Learned Additional Advocate General has placed reliance on the judgments of the
Apex Court in Grindlays Bank Ltd. v. Central Government Industrial Tribunal and
Ors.,11 and Kapra Mazdoor Ekta Union v. Management of Birla Cotton Spinning and
Weaving Mills Ltd. and Ors12 in support of the contention that the power of
procedural review was available.
(iii) The petitioners on the other hand have contended that the power of review ought
to be specifically conferred by a statute and that inherent powers cannot be availed to
review an order. Without prejudice to the above contention, it was further contended
that the impugned order passed on a bare scrutiny would reveal that the impugned
order has been passed by review of the order on merits after fresh consideration and
hence is plainly in excess of power of procedural review as contended by the State.
11 AIR 1981 SC 606.
12 AIR 2005 SC 1782.
(iv) The Apex Court in Kapra Mazdoor Ekta's case13 has first affirmed the position of law that the
power of review must be conferred by a statute specifically or by necessary implication. While
affirming the law laid down in the case of Dr. (Smt.) Kuntesh Gupta v. Management of Hindu
Mahavidyalaya, Sitapur (U.P.) and Others14, Patel Narshi Thakershi and Others., v. Sri
Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji15, but after referring to Grindlays Bank16 has held that the
Authorities could exercise the power of
(a) procedural review and (b) review on merits. A close reading of para-19 of the judgment in Kapra
Mazdoor Ekta Union,17 though does affirm the existence of power of procedural review, but limits it
to a category of cases; such as orders passed without notice to the opposite party, matters taken up
for hearing and 13 Ibid 14 (1987) 4 SCC 525.
15 1971(3) SCC 844.
16 Supra note 11.
17 Supra note 12.
decided on a date other than date fixed for its hearing and like instances.
(v) Such cases referred to, contemplate of a mistake committed by virtue of error of procedure
vitiating the proceedings leading to setting aside the impugned order and re-hearing the same
taking note of the procedural infirmity that has ensued.
The existence of such power is not in dispute but in the present case the defect in the order that is
sought to be addressed cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to be an error of procedure. The
impugned order reveals of a review on merits, this becomes apparent on a reading of the order of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 65
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
Deputy Commissioner dated 20.06.2012 which is a considered order passed on merits and the
present impugned order in effect reflects fresh consideration and arrival of a different conclusion.
(vi) What needs to be noted is that the Deputy Commissioner at the first instance in the order
passed in case Nos.RRT (others) 230 (1-10)/2009-2010, 1109 & 1152/2011-2012 dated 20.06.2012
had dropped the proceedings initiated under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act on the premise that the
lands were Government lands, and had eventually ordered the cancellation of entry in Column- 11 of
the RTC indicating the nature of land holding as 'Kharab' The Authority had come to such
conclusion after a detailed discussion after referring to the Instrument of Accession and the legal
opinion dated 28.10.2011 and concluded that the properties held by the Royal Family were their
private properties.
(vii) The order recalling the order dated 20.06.2012 came to be challenged before this Court in
W.P.Nos.47983-47984/2012 and other petitions, wherein the orders recalling the order dated
20.06.2012 were set aside reserving liberty to initiate fresh proceedings, if it was found necessary,
after issuing notice to the parties and then proceed to take decision afresh. However, such order
cannot be construed ipso facto as conferring powers on the Deputy Commissioner to review the
order dated 20.06.2012 on merits.
(viii) In effect, the Deputy Commissioner has by the impugned orders dated 26.05.2015 passed an
entirely different order while referring to various documents. The Deputy Commissioner has
proceeded to reason that the power to withdraw the earlier order could be traced to inherent power
available under Section 25 of the K.L.R. Act. The Deputy Commissioner has proceeded on the
premise that land classified as 'B Kharab' cannot be diverted. It was observed that the question of
entering names of private persons who trace their title to the Maharaja of Mysore was a subject
matter of litigation in W.P.No.36901/1999, wherein this Court had directed the parties to make an
application after the decision of the competent Authority.
(ix) It is well settled that the power of review is not an inherent power and must be conferred either
expressly or by necessary implication and that inherent powers cannot be invoked to review an
order. Recourse in the present case to Section 25 of the K.L.R. Act to justify review of the earlier
order is not legally permissible. The observations of the Apex court in Patel Narshi Thakershi18
extracted below justifies the above conclusion:-
"4. ...It is well settled that the power to review is not an inherent power. It must be
conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication...."
18 Supra note 15.
The Apex Court had reiterated the same position in Kuntesh Gupta19 and Binabai Bhate v. State of
Madhya Pradesh, and Others20, where the Apex Court has held that the power of review is a
"creature of the statute" and must be specifically conferred, as also this Court in the case of
D.P.Sharma v. State Transport Authority21. In light of absence of any provision conferring power of
review, the impugned order which has the effect of reviewing the earlier order of the Deputy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 66
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
Commissioner dated 20.06.2012 on its merits cannot be sustained more so in light of the finding
made above that there was no occasion to exercise power of procedural review.
(x) Having held that reconsideration of the order dated 20.06.2012 is impermissible, in light of the
contentions raised by parties as regards the merits of Supra note 14, ¶ 11 20(2011) 13 SCC 32 ¶ 17 21
ILR 1987 KAR 3255 ¶ 11 the impugned order, the other points for consideration are dealt with as
below.
(b) Exercise of power under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act:
The State while justifying the action of the Deputy Commissioner in passing the
impugned order has contended that Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act could be invoked
whenever State seeks to assert rights over any property leading to a formal enquiry
and passing of an order deciding such claim. It is further contended that all revenue
and survey records indicate that the properties were "B Kharab" lands which being
public property, the petitioners' assertion of private rights justifiably could be a
subject matter of enquiry under Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act.
(ii) The learned counsel for the petitioners on the other hand have contended that the
power to adjudicate on questions as to whether the property is the private property of
the petitioners or property belonging to the State is beyond the scope of enquiry as
envisaged under Section 67(2) of K.L.R. Act and cannot be invoked in the present
case where title is being claimed through sale deeds that could be traced to the
Maharaja of Mysore. It is contended that revenue authorities though are treated to be
courts possessing quasi judicial power, they cannot be deemed to possess power to
adjudicate, culminating in a decision having the effect of setting aside of the
registered instruments.
(iii) In the cases on hand, all the petitioners trace their title to the Maharaja of
Mysore and claim to have derived title through registered deeds of conveyance. The
revenue records have also been effected reflecting such transfer of title. The Mysore
Maharaja himself who is now represented by his wife in W.P. No.25592/2015 has
asserted title by relying on the agreement dated 23.01.1950 between the Governor
General of India and the Maharaja of Mysore read alongwith the list of properties
furnished which enumerates the properties in question to be private properties of the
Maharaja of Mysore22.
(iv) In light of the nature of claim of the Maharaja of Mysore, and the petitioners who
claim subsidiary title and controvertion of such assertion by the State would by itself
prima facie indicate a dispute relating to title. Such dispute relating to title falls
outside the purview of any enquiry under Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act.
(v) The Apex Court in the case of
M.Sankaranarayanan v. Deputy Commissioner,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 67
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
Bangalore and Others23, has dealt with the precise question in an identical factual
matrix relating to the same provision. The facts in the aforesaid case was that the
Secretary of the Karnataka Public Service
22 Annexure-W in W.P.Nos.25462-497/2015 23 (2017) 13 SCC 661 Commission had lodged a
complaint on 14.05.2004 stating that the sale deed of the year 1900 relied upon by the First Princess
of Mysore and who had executed several conveyances was illegal as the said sale deed was executed
by Lancelot Ricketts in favour of the Dewan of Mysore and not to the First Princess of Mysore. The
proceedings were initiated under Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act as regards the occupants. The matter
was taken up before the High Court and in the writ appeal, this Court had relegated the parties to
the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal. The said matter when taken up before the Apex Court and the
Apex Court after noticing that there was title in the occupants that was traceable through sale deeds
and noting further that the transaction was about 104 years prior to the issuance of sale deed and
that the State had acquired portion of the same property has held as follows:
"15. A bare reading of Section 67 shows that public roads, streets, lanes, etc. and all
lands which are not properties of others, belong to the Government. Where the
property is recorded in the ownership of any other person or persons who are legally
capable of holding the property, the provisions of Section 67 will not apply. Section
67 cannot be used to dispute the title of persons who have been holding the property
for more than 100 years...."
This position of law has been reiterated in the case of Kutchi Lal Rameshwar Ashram Trust Evam
Anna Kshetra Trust, through Velji Devshi Patel v. Collector, Haridwar and Others24 at para-25,
where the Court goes a step further to hold that the power to adjudicate is solely with the civil courts
and has observed as follows:
"25. ... To allow administrative authorities of the State - including the Collector, as in
the present case - to adjudicate upon matters of title involving civil disputes would be
destructive of the Rule of Law. The Collector is an officer of the State. He can exercise
only such powers as the law specifically confers upon him to enter upon private
disputes. In contrast, a civil court has the 24 (2017) 16 SCC 418 jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon all matters involving civil disputes except where the jurisdiction of
the court is taken away, either expressly or by necessary implication, by statute...."
(vi) A Full Bench of this Court in the case of Jayamma and Others v. State of Karnataka, represented
by its Secretary and Others25 was considering the scope and extent of power conferred on the
Deputy Commissioner who was acting as a quasi judicial Authority while exercising the revisional
powers. The Court while reiterating the position of law as noticed above and noticing that the
Karnataka Land Revenue Act, 1964 has been enacted in exercise of legislative power traceable to
Entry-45 and Entry-65 of List-II of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India has observed as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 68
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
"67. ...Revenue authorities do not regulate the acquisition or extinction of rights in
properties including agricultural lands etc., Revenue 25 W.P.No.6872/2013 disposed
off on 24.01.2020 authorities are primarily required to keep a record of the names of
persons, who have acquired rights for ensuring that the revenue i.e., the land revenue
is collected from such persons which is the basic purpose of the Act."
"84. Admittedly the object of the Act is only relating to land, the assessment and
recovery of land revenue, the land revenue administration and other matters as
contemplated under Entry 45 List-II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of
India."
"85. The scope and object of the Act is only to deal with the land revenue including
assessment and collection of revenue, maintenance of land revenue records, survey
for revenue purpose, record of rights and alienation of revenue and authorities under
Land Revenue Act have no jurisdiction to decide the title between the parties in
respect of immovable property."
As K.L.R. Act traces its source of power to Entry-45 of List-II of Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution of India, even while construing the existence of expansive powers to deal with allied
issues related to items in Entry-45 of List-II, it cannot be stretched so far as to confer powers
relating to adjudication of title disputes which is the sole domain of courts.
(vii) It is also to be noted that Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act can be invoked only where title is not
vested in any individual. In all the cases that were pending before the Deputy Commissioner, the
petitioners rely on registered instruments, the cancellation of which would require an appropriate
declaration by Court as per Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The Deputy Commissioner
acting as an Enquiring Authority in terms of Section 67 of K.L.R. Act exercising power in accordance
with the procedure as contemplated under the K.L.R. Rules clearly reflects of a summary enquiry
and the Deputy Commissioner cannot be construed to be a court for the purposes of Section 31 of
the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
(viii) The Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Padmavati Devi (Smt.) (Dead) by LRs and
Others 26 where question arose as to whether the State Government can take recourse to a summary
procedure under the State revenue laws when such person raises a bona fide dispute about his right
to remain in occupation over such land by way of defence to the claim of ejectment, held as follows:
"6. As noticed earlier Section 91 of the Act prescribes a summary procedure for
eviction of a person who is found to be in unauthorised occupation of Government
land. The said provisions cannot be invoked in a case where the person in occupation
raises bona fide dispute about his right to remain in occupation over the land.
Dealing with similar provisions contained in Section 6 of the Andhra Pradesh Land
Encroachment Act, 1945, this Court in Govt. of A.P. v. Thummala Krishna Rao has
laid down that the summary remedy for eviction provided by Section 6 of the said Act
could be resorted to by the Government only against persons who are in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 69
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
unauthorised (1995) Supp.(2) SCC 290 occupation of any land which is the property
of the Government and if the person in occupation has a bona fide claim to litigate he
could not be ejected save by the due process of law and that the summary remedy
prescribed by Section 6 was not the kind of legal process which is suited to an
adjudication of complicated questions of title. For the same reasons, it can be said
that summary remedy available under Section 91 of the Act is not the legal process
which is suited for adjudication of complicated questions of title where the person
sought to be evicted as an unauthorised occupant makes a bona fide claim regarding
his right to be in possession. In such a case the proper course is to have the matter
adjudicated by the ordinary courts of law."
The power under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act is vested in a "court" to make a declaration
that any person is entitled to any legal character or to any right in property. Such power would
extend to cancellation of registered instruments as being void or voidable as the case may be under
Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act.
(ix) To construe that there is no bar on the revenue court on adjudicating issues which would have
the effect of declaration as regards to the legal character or any right in the property would imply
that a revenue court is "court" for the purposes of Sections 31 and 34 of the Specific Relief Act, which
is untenable as discussed in paragraph Nos. (vi) and (vii).
(x) In the present case, the nature of enquiry as contemplated under Section 67 of the K.L.R. Act
expressly excludes cases where the dispute relates to property "which are not the property of
individuals" and excludes such disputes where "rights of such persons may be established," all of
which makes it clear that the adjudicating authority under Section 67 of K.L.R. Act has a
self-limiting jurisdiction as noticed above. Accordingly, wherever the facts make out for the
existence of dispute that involves adjudication by a court in exercise of power conferred under
Sections 31 and 34 of the Specific Relief Act relating to a property, the adjudicating authority under
Section 67 of K.L.R. Act is ousted from adjudication of such disputes.
(xi) The exclusion of jurisdiction of a court under Section 9 of C.P.C. presupposes bar of cognizance
of suits either expressly or impliedly. The procedure prescribed under the K.L.R. Act and the K.L.R.
Rules providing for adjudication of claims would indicate that the enquiry is summary in nature,
excluding exercise of power under Section 31 or Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act and hence in
the present case, the civil courts continue to have jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes as made out
and their jurisdiction is not excluded by the redressal mechanism provided for under the K.L.R. Act.
Accordingly, the remedy under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act cannot be an answer to the State's
assertion of its rights over the properties of petitioners who base their title on registered
instruments.
(c) Bar to entertain disputes, except as provided by the Agreement dated 23.01.1950 and the express
bar of interference by courts as contained in Article 363 of the Constitution of India:
1. Bar as per Agreement dated 23.01.1950:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 70
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
(i) An Instrument of Accession27 was entered into between the Maharaja of Mysore
and the Dominion of India acceding Mysore to the Dominion of India. An agreement
was entered into on 23.01.195028 between the Governor General of India and the
Maharaja of Mysore which provided for rights, privileges and dignities of the
Maharaja. Article II(1) of the agreement provides that the Maharaja shall be entitled
to the full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties as distinct from
State properties. Article II(2) of the agreement further provides that the Maharaja of
Mysore would furnish to the Government of India an inventory of all immoveable
property held by him as such private property. The list of immoveable properties held
by the 27 Annexure-U in W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015 28 Annexure-V1 in
W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015 Maharaja of Mysore as private property as on
26.01.1950 is notified by the Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of
States29. As per the list, the properties which are the subject matter of impugned
orders of the Deputy Commissioner are found to be the private properties of the
Maharaja of Mysore.
The State does not controvert the plain understanding of the list of properties, but contends that the
properties that have been classified as 'B Kharab' properties could not have been given to the
Maharaja of Mysore as per the agreement.
(ii) Article II(3) of the agreement provides that disputes relating to whether any item of property is
the private property of the Maharaja or property of the State is to be referred to such person as the
Government of India may nominate and the decision of such person shall be final and binding on all
concerned. It is clear that in light of the specific contention by the State, Annexure-W in
W.P.Nos.25462-25497/2015 including as made out in their statement of objections that the
properties are 'B Kharab' lands and hence belong to the State and can never be deemed to have been
vested in the Maharaja, is a dispute relating to the provision in the agreement. Such dispute that is
now sought to be made out would require to be referred to the person as contemplated under Article
II(3) of the agreement dated 23.01.1950 and cannot be a subject matter for adjudication by any
other mode of redressal available in usual course.
2. Bar as contained in Article 363 of the Constitution of India:-
(i) Article 363 of the Constitution of India bars interference by courts in disputes
arising out of provisions of a treaty/agreement/covenant or other similar instruments
executed before the commencement of Constitution by any ruler of an Indian State
and the Government of Dominion of India. The agreement entered into on
23.01.1950 is prior to 26.01.1950 when the Constitution came into force. It is not in
dispute that the Maharaja of Mysore pursuant to the agreement dated 23.01.1950
between the Maharaja and the Dominion of India has furnished an inventory which
contains details of private properties which are the subject matter of present
litigation. If that were to be so, the present dispute is one relating to the 'provision of
a treaty/agreement' as contemplated under Article 363 of the Constitution of India.
Accordingly, the bar under Article 363 of Constitution of India would also operate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/39689700/ 71
N Raghavendra Murthy vs State Of Karnataka on 19 June, 2020
shutting out interference by courts. Further, as noticed above, the resolution of
dispute relating to provision of agreement would have to be made by falling back
upon the provisions of the agreement itself.
Accordingly, the interference by the Deputy Commissioner in the present case is impermissible.
(ii) The Apex Court while considering assertion of a dispute by the Maharaja of Holkar relating to
the properties in the inventory has held that there would be a bar under Article 363 of the
Constitution of India in the case of State of Madhya Pradesh v. Ushadevi30. On similar lines, the
court has upheld the bar under Article 363 in the case of Dr. Karan Singh v. State of J&K and
Another31 which fortifies the above conclusion.
(iii) The contention of learned Additional Advocate General that procedure for resolution of dispute
as per Article II(3) of the agreement would not be applicable insofar as many of the petitioners are
private parties claiming through the Maharaja of Mysore is liable to be rejected, as the bar relates to
dispute relating to the provision of the agreement, which dispute can be at the instance of any
person not necessarily by a party to the agreement. It is also to be noted that the 30 (2015) 8 SCC
672 ¶ 24 31 (2004) 5 SCC 698 ¶ 18 Maharaja himself through his legal representatives is the
petitioner in W.P.No.25592/2015.
(d) Power must be exercised within a reasonable time:
(i) By virtue of the impugned order dated 26.05.2015, it is declared that the lands in
question were 'B Kharab' lands and is to be reserved for public purpose. Further, the
Tahsildar has been directed to cancel all Kathas standing in the names of the
petitioners in the survey numbers in question. As the Katha in the names of
successive predecessors-in-title of the petitioners can be traced back to the time
subsequent to the conveyance by the Maharaja on the first occasion, the exercise of
power by initiating proceedings in the year 2011-2012 by the Authorities has been
called into question by a large number of petitioners on the ground that power is
sought to be exercised after an unreasonable period of delay of many decades.
(ii) The learned counsel for the petitioners have filed the synopsis with necessary documents
detailing sale from the Maharaja of Mysore, mutation entry effected pursuant to such conveyance at
the first instance as per the order dated 27.05.2020 passed in W.P.No.22658/2015 and connected
writ petitions.
(iii) Taking note of the details furnished as well as the details available in the writ petitions and the
synopsis filed earlier, the Table hereinbelow is prepared. The transfer of title by the Maharaja of
Mysore in favour of predecessor-in-title of the petitioners is evidenced by the details furnished in
Column No.2 and the details the earliest mutation/RTCs which have been ordered to be set aside are

(iv) The impugned orders are passed purportedly
in exercise of power conferred under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act adjudicating the claim of the
State that the lands in question were 'B Kharab' lands.
(v) The proceedings were admittedly initiated in 2011-2012 whereas the conveyances in favour of
many of the petitioners as per the details available in the Table were many decades previously.
Subsequent to such transfer in many of the cases, mutation/revenue entries have been effected. In
fact as per the order dated 10.05.196832, record of rights have been entered with respect to the
entire extent of 1563 acres 31 guntas of Sy.No.4 of Kurubarahalli by the then Tahsildar.
(vi) It is settled position in law that power conferred on an Authority or by a statute must be
exercised within a reasonable period of time. The Apex Court in Santoshkumar Shivgonda Patil and
Others v. Balasaheb Tukaram Shevale and Others33 was considering the case of exercise of
revisional power under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966. Admittedly, there
was no time limit prescribed for exercise of such power under the law and when such power was
sought to be exercised after 17 years, it was held as follows:-
Annexure-M in W.P.No.25663-25673/2015 (2009) 9 SCC 352.
"11. It seems to be fairly settled that if a statute does not prescribe the time-limit for exercise of
revisional power, it does not mean that such power can be exercised at any time; rather it should be
exercised within a reasonable time. It is so because the law does not expect a settled thing to be
unsettled after a long lapse of time. Where the Legislature does not provide for any length of time
within which the power of revision is to be exercised by the authority, suo motu or otherwise, it is
plain that exercise of such power within reasonable time is inherent therein." In the present case,
the exercise of power asserting the State's claim in the year 2011-2012 having the consequence of
cancelling mutations effected several decades ago as reflected in Column No.3 of the Table extracted
hereinabove is clearly an effort to exercise power conferred beyond a reasonable period of time and
hence impermissible. Accordingly, in such of the cases where mutation has been effected pursuant
to the transfer by the Maharaja of Mysore at the first instance as indicated in Column No.3, exercise
of power in the year 2010, 2011-2012 many decades subsequent to the effecting of such mutations is
bad in law, as power is not only sought to be exercised after a reasonable period of time, but beyond
the period of limitation prescribed in Section 27 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
(e) Alternative remedy:
(i) It is the contention of the State that as against the impugned order passed by the
Deputy Commissioner under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act, there are alternative
remedies available as provided under Section 67(3) of the K.L.R. Act which includes
filing of a civil suit against the order passed under Section 67(2) of the K.L.R. Act or
as against an order passed in revision or appeal.

(ii) On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioners have contended that the
impugned order is passed without jurisdiction and if that were to be so, the writ
petitions challenging the validity of such orders would be maintainable.
(iii) It is settled legal position that relegating the petitioners to avail the alternative
remedy to challenge the impugned orders as provided for under the statute instead of
entertaining the writ petitions directly is a matter left to the discretion of the Court to
be exercised keeping in mind the settled principle that a writ petition can be
entertained directly against an order passed without jurisdiction. In fact, in the case
of M.Sankaranarayanan34 in the context of a broadly similar factual matrix and legal
controversy where the jurisdiction of the revenue authority under Section 67 of the
K.L.R. Act to initiate proceedings in respect of time barred claims was being
considered, the Apex Court has held that the challenge to a notice without
jurisdiction could be directly entertained under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India.
34 Supra note 23 ¶19.
(iv) Even in the case of Kuntesh Gupta35 wherein a similar legal contention as regards to the power
of review being exercised which came to be challenged was considered by the Apex Court. While
holding that the Vice Chancellor did not have power of review as the same was not conferred by the
Statutes of the University, and as regards availing of alternative remedy, it was held that the
impugned order being one without jurisdiction, alternative remedy was not a bar to entertain the
writ.
(v) Accordingly, in light of the discussion supra regarding the legality of the impugned order which
would clearly indicate that the impugned order is one without jurisdiction, it cannot be held that the
writ petitions filed are not maintainable and hence the arguments to the contrary by the State are
rejected. 35 Supra note 14.
(vi) It is the contention of the State that the Division Bench of this Court in W.P.No.6529/2007 and
connected matters had relegated the parties claiming through the Maharaja of Mysore to work out
their remedies before the civil court and a similar result ought to follow in the present case. A careful
perusal of the said order would indicate that the Court has refused to adjudicate the issue in light of
disputed questions of fact relating to the question as to whether the property in Survey No.1, Mysore
Kasaba Hobli, Mysore was the private property of Maharaja of Mysore or belonged to the State.
However, such exercise of discretion by the Court in refusing to adjudicate the claim made by the
petitioners cannot forbid adjudication in any other subsequent case where material is placed before
the Court enabling such adjudication. It is also to be noted that such adjudication as made by the
Deputy Commissioner in the order dated 20.06.2012 is not in challenge in the present proceedings.
It is the order dated 26.05.2015 which in effect has reviewed the order dated 20.06.2012 that has
been challenged in these writ petitions. Hence, the order passed in W.P.No.6529/2007 and
connected matters will not come to the aid of the State.
