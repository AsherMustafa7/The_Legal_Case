Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
BANGALORE CITY, SCCH 14 PARTLY ALLOWING THE CLAIM
PETITION FOR COMPESNATION AND SEEKING ENHANCEMENT OF
COMPENSATION.
THIS M.F.A. HAVING BEEN HEARD AND RESERVED FOR
JUDGMENT COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF JUDGMENT,
THIS DAY C.M.JOSHI J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
Aggrieved by the judgment and award passed in MVC No.176/2012 on 18th August 2014 by the
learned XVI Additional Judge, Court of Small Causes and Member, MACT, Bangalore City, SCCH
14, the appellants/ petitioners have approached this Court in appeal, assailing the quantum of the
compensation.
By the impugned judgment and award, the Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.4,02,000/- after
deducting 20% towards contributory negligence on the part of the deceased, together with interest
at 9% p.a. from the date of petition till realization.
2. For the sake of convenience, the parties herein are referred to as per their ranks before the
Tribunal.
3. The brief facts of the case are as below:
The petitioners filed a claim petition under Section 166 of M.V. Act, claiming
compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- on account of the death of one Sudhakar in a road
traffic accident that occurred on 10-07-2011 at 1.30 p.m. It was contended by the
petitioners that, they were the grandmother, sister and brother of the deceased
Sudhakar and he was riding a motorcycle bearing No.KA- 02- EQ- 6051 on the
National Highway No.7, Hosur- Bengaluru main road in front of Balegarana Halli
Gate, Athibele Hobli, Anekal Taluk, along with the pillion rider Nagesh. When they
were crossing the road, a car bearing No. TN-74-P-7234 came at high speed in a rash
and negligent manner and dashed against the motorcycle of the deceased and as a
result, Sudhakar sustained injuries to his head and legs and he was taken to Sparsh
hospital, Hosur Road, Bangalore, wherein he took treatment and thereafter, he died
on 22-7-2011 while shifting to Live 100 hospital Bangalore on account of the injuries
sustained in the accident and petitioners have spent more than Rs.2,00,000/-
towards transportation of the body and funeral expenses.
It was contended that prior to the accident, deceased Sudhakar was working as a
loader and unloader and doing the coolie work and earning Rs.8,000/- per month.
Due to the sudden death of the deceased, the petitioners have lost love and affection
and their livelihood as they lost the only earning member of the family. Subsequent
to the accident, the police have registered a case against the driver of the car in Crime
No. 173/2011 for the offences punishable under Section 279, 338 and 304 (A) of IPC.
It is contended that the respondents being the owner and insurer of the offending
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 3
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
vehicle are liable to pay the compensation of Rs.20,00,000/-.
4. In pursuant to the notice issued by the Tribunal, respondents have appeared before the Tribunal
through their counsel and filed objection statement.
5. Respondent No.1, owner of the vehicle admitted that the police have registered a case against the
driver and he was RC holder of the car bearing No.TN.74-D-7234 and the driver of the car was
having a valid driving license at the time of the accident. It was contended that the accident occurred
due to the negligence of the driver of the Two wheeler i.e. the deceased and that his vehicle was
insured with respondent No.2- insurance company and therefore, he has sought for dismissal of the
petition with costs.
6. Respondent No.2- insurance company admitted that it had issued a policy in respect of the car
owned by respondent No.1 and it is not aware of the relationship of the petitioners with the
deceased. It was contended that respondent No.1 and the concerned police have failed to forward
the documents and therefore, respondent No.2 is not liable to indemnify respondent No.1. It was
further contended that the driver of the car was not having a valid and effective driving license at the
time of the accident and also that the accident was due to the negligence of the deceased and as
such, alleging that the compensation claimed is highly exaggerated baseless and imaginary, sought
for dismissal of the petition with costs.
7. On the basis of the above pleadings, the following issues were framed by the Tribunal:
"1. Whether the petitioners proves that the deceased died in an accident arising out of
negligence of the Motor Car bearing No.TN-74-P-7234 occurred on 10.07.2011 at
about 1.30 P.M.?
2. Whether the petitioners proves that he is LRs of the deceased Sudhakar?
3. Whether the petitioners are entitled to compensation? If so, how much and from
whom?
4. What Order?"
8. The petitioners led evidence before the Tribunal. Petitioner No.3 was examined as PW1 and two
witnesses were examined as PWs 2 and 3. They got marked the documents at Exhibits P1 to P15. The
respondents have not produced any evidence on their behalf.
9. After hearing both the sides, the Tribunal held that the deceased Sudhakar has contributed
negligence to the extent of 20% and by holding that the petitioners being the class II heirs, are
entitled for a compensation of Rs.4,02,000/- i.e. 80% of Rs.5,01,500/- with interest at 9% per
annum from the date of petition till its realization under different heads as below:
Medical Expenses Rs. 62,000/-
Loss of estate (81,000 x 18 x 25%) Rs.3,64,500/-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 4
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
Loss of love and affection Rs. 25,000/-
Transportation and funeral expenses Rs. 25,000/-
Pain and sufferings Rs. 25,000/-
Total Rs.5,01,500/-
10. Aggrieved by the said the judgment and award passed by the Tribunal, the petitioners have
approached this Court in appeal contending that the Tribunal has erred in awarding the
compensation of Rs.62,000/- under the head of medical expenses though the actual medical
expenses was to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/-. They also contended that the Tribunal erred in awarding
compensation of Rs.25,000/- under the head of pain and suffering and it also erred in not
computing the loss of dependency and erred in awarding Rs.3,64,500/- towards loss of estate and it
was also incorrect in holding that the loss of love and affection can be compensated by awarding
Rs.25,000/-. Thus by contending that the Tribunal has erred in awarding the compensation and
attributing 20% of the contributory negligence to the deceased and therefore, they have sought for
intervention by this Court.
11. On the issuance of notice by this Court, respondent No.2-insurance company has appeared
through its counsel and notice to respondent No.1 has been dispensed with at the risk of the
appellants.
12. The records of the Tribunal have been secured and the arguments by learned counsel appearing
for the appellants Sri Suresh M. Latur and the arguments by learned counsel for the respondent
No.2-Insurance Company Sri O. Mahesh have been heard.
13. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submits that the contributory negligence could
not have been attributed to the deceased, as it was observed by the Tribunal that the accident has
happened at the centre of the road and the decision in the case of Syed Sadiq and others V.
Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited1 lays down that, "when the accident
has happened at the centre of the road, no contributory negligence can be attributed to the
deceased".
14. He also relied on the decision in the case of Kiran V. Sajjan Singh and others2, wherein it was
held that "when there is a collision between the tractor and the motorcycle away from opposite
directions and the accident was in the middle-of-the-road, no contributory negligence could be
attributed to the motorcyclist as the chargesheet has been filed against the driver of the tractor". He
further contended that the Tribunal erred in holding that the income of the deceased was Rs.4,500/-
per month and it should have taken into consideration the fact that he was aged 20 years and he was
a 2014 ACJ 627 2014 ACJ 2550
- 10 -
coolie and therefore, the income should have been taken as contended by the petitioners. It was also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 5
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
contended that the Tribunal erred in not awarding the proper compensation under the head of loss
of dependency, loss of love and affection, loss of estate and etc. and as such, he has submitted that
the quantum of compensation arrived at by the Tribunal is incorrect and the same is to be
re-assessed by this Court.
15. The learned counsel Sri O.Mahesh, appearing for the respondent No.2- insurance company has
contended that the Tribunal is justified in taking the income of the deceased at Rs.4,500/- per
month and at no stretch of imagination, the submissions made by the learned counsel for the
appellants could be accepted that the deceased was earning more than Rs.7,000/- per month at the
time of the incident. It was also contended that the grandmother, brother and sister of the deceased
are not the dependants and therefore, the compensation under the head of 'loss of estate' alone is
entitled by them. He further submits that the Tribunal is justified in holding that there is a
contributory negligence on the part of deceased, but he contends that the contributory negligence
should have been held at 50% in view of
- 11 -
the fact that, when the deceased was crossing the lanes, he did not observe the on coming vehicle in
his effort to cross the road. It is submitted that the accident was due to the sheer negligence of
deceased and therefore, the compensation arrived at by the Tribunal is to be reduced. It is also
contended that, at the most, the income that was considered under the Minimum Wages Act, for an
unskilled labourer could be considered by this Court, while assessing the compensation.
16. In the light of the above submissions made by both the sides, this Court has to find out whether
the award passed by the Tribunal is just and reasonable considering the evidence placed on record.
17. It is pertinent to note that the spot sketch prepared by the police at the time of the spot mahzar is
produced at Ex.P7 and the spot mahazar is produced at Ex.P6. These two documents constitute
basis for assessing whether any contributory negligence can be attributed on the part of the
deceased or not.
- 12 -
18. A careful perusal of Exs.P6 and P7 show that it is the National Highway and four lane highway is
divided by a median in between. The deceased was crossing the road at the place where the median
has a opening for changing the lanes. It appears that the deceased Sudhakar was trying to take a
U-turn at a place where the divider had ended and without looking to the on coming speeding car,
he tried to take the U-turn and the car hit upon the front portion of the motorcycle of the deceased.
The report of the Motor Vehicle Inspector also supports this circumstance and therefore, there
cannot be any doubt that the deceased could have avoided the accident had he seen the oncoming
the car. This aspect has been observed by the Tribunal while considering the issue No.1. We do not
find any reason to differ with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal in this regard.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 6
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
19. The decisions cited by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants is regarding the accident
which had happened at the center of the road, which did not had any median. In the case on hand,
the road is divided by a median and while the deceased was taking a U-turn, he should have seen the
oncoming vehicle. It being a highway, every precaution should have been taken by the
- 13 -
deceased also. Therefore, we do not see that the decisions relied by learned counsel appearing for
the appellants have any application to the facts and circumstances of the present case. The Tribunal
has considered this aspect and has come to the conclusion that the deceased contributed to the
extent of 20% of the negligence and we also do not see any illegality in such conclusion.
20. Considering the fact that the car driver should have anticipated a pedestrian or any other vehicle
coming from his right side at the place where the median had a opening for the vehicles taking the
U-turn, the attribution of 80% of the negligence towards the car driver is justifiable.
21. The learned counsel appearing for the insurance company, Sri O. Mahesh, has contended that
the income of the deceased taken at Rs.4,500/- per month is justifiable. The learned counsel for the
appellants have contended that the deceased was a loader and as such, he was having income of
Rs.8,000/- per month. It is contended that the Guidelines issued by the Karnataka State Legal
Services Authority regarding the notional income for the purpose of settlement of the cases before
the Lok
- 14 -
Adalath may be adopted and according to this, a sum of Rs.6,500/- per month may be considered by
the Court.
22. However, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.2- insurance company has
contended that the Guidelines issued by the Legal Services Authority are only for the purpose of the
settlement before the Lok Adalath and thus they cannot be adopted while granting the
compensation in the Court. He submits that the minimum wages fixed under the Minimum Wages
Act, may be considered as guidelines and therefore, he submits that the sum of Rs.4,550/- was the
minimum wages fixed during the said time and therefore, the Tribunal is justified in holding the
income at Rs.4,500/- per month.
23. The question as to whether the guidelines issued by the Legal Services Authority can be adopted
or whether the Tribunals have to depend upon the Minimum Wages Act, appears to be the bone of
contention between the parties.
24. It is relevant to note that in a recent decision in the case of Meena Pawaria and others Vs.
Ashrafali and others3, 2021 SCC online SC 1083
- 15 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 7
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
the Apex Court had an occasion to consider the minimum wages prescribed under the Act and it was
held that the minimum wages fixed under the said Act can be considered as guidelines and
depending on the educational qualifications and other circumstances, the income of III year
Engineering Student may be considered at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month.
25. Further, in the case of Jakir Hussein V. Sabir4, the Apex Court had an occasion to consider as to
whether the minimum wages fixed can be considered as guidelines. In para 14, it was held as below:
"14. We have carefully examined the facts of the case and material evidence on record
in the light of the rival legal contentions urged before us by both the learned counsel
on behalf of the parties to find out as to whether the appellant is entitled for further
enhancement of compensation. We have perused the impugned judgment and order
of the High Court and the award of the Tribunal. After careful examination of the
facts and legal evidence on record, it is not in dispute that the appellant was working
as a driver at the time of the accident and no doubt, he could be earning Rs 4500 per
month. As per the notification issued by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh
under Section 3 of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, a person employed as a driver
earns Rs 128 per day, however the wage rate as per the minimum wage notification is
only a yardstick and not an absolute factor to be taken to determine the
compensation under the future loss of income. Minimum wage, as per the State
Government notification alone may at times fail to meet the requirements that are
needed to maintain (2015) 7 SCC 252
- 16 -
the basic quality of life since it is not inclusive of factors of cost of living index. Therefore, we are of
the view that it would be just and reasonable to consider the appellant's daily wage at Rs 150 per day
(Rs 4500 per month i.e. Rs 54,000 per annum) as he was a driver of the motor vehicle which is a
skilled job. Further, the Tribunal has wrongly determined the loss of income during the course of his
treatment at Rs 51,000 for a period of one year and five months. We have to enhance the same to Rs
76,500 (Rs 4500 × 17 months)."
(emphasis by us)
26. Again, in the case of Smt. Neeta and others V. Divisional Manager MSRTC Kolhapur , it was held
that "minimum wages prescribed under the Minimum Wages Act, may be considered" and
accordingly, the compensation was assessed by the court.
27. Further, the decision in the case of the Kala Devi and others V. Bhagwan Das Chouhan and
others6 also lays down that the minimum wages may be considered to be the guidelines in assessing
the compensation by adopting the notional income when there is no specific proof of the income.
28. In another decision in the case of Sonobanu Nazirbhai Mirza Vs. Ahmadabad Municipal
Transport Service7, again, it (2015) 3 SCC 590 (2015) 2 SCC 771 (2013) 16 SCC 719;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 8
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
- 17 -
was held that the minimum wages may be considered to be the guidelines in assessing the notional
income.
29. In the case of Pushkar Mehra V. Brij Mohan Kushwaha and others8 it was held that "the
minimum wages prescribed for unskilled worker could be considered for assessing the
compensation to a victim of an accident".
30. In the case of Govind Yadav V. The New India Insurance Company Limited and another9, again,
the Apex Court has reiterated the importance of the Minimum Wages Act in assessing the notional
income of the deceased, who had no proof of income.
31. Further, in yet another decision in the case of Ningamma and another V United India insurance
Company Limited10, the Apex Court has referred to the Minimum Wages Act, in assessing the
notional income of the deceased and to arrive at a just compensation when the petition was filed
under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
(2015) 12 SCC 688, (2011) 10 SCC 683 (2009) 13 SCC 710
- 18 -
32. Thus, it is evident from the above decisions that the Apex Court has shown a continuous and
consistent trend that the Minimum Wages Act, provide for a source by which the notional income of
the deceased, who had no valid proof of income could be assessed. It is worth to note that the
Minimum Wages Act prescribed a method under which the income of a skilled, unskilled,
semiskilled and skilled worker can be considered. It acts as a basis for various other purposes and
even under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Therefore, the notional income of a deceased who
did not have a valid proof of income can very well be guided by the wages fixed under the Minimum
Wages Act and it is for the Tribunal to consider whether he was a skilled, unskilled, semiskilled or
unskilled labourer. The range of the wages between highly skilled and unskilled labourer may have
to be considered by the Tribunal while assessing the income of the deceased. The wages under the
Minimum Wages Act serve as the guidance and depending on the educational, economic conditions
and age, the tribunals have to consider the notional income.
33. Coming to the question whether the guidelines issued by the Legal Services Authority can be
considered or not, it is
- 19 -
pertinent to note that the guidelines, a copy of which is made available to this court, by and large are
on the same lines as fixed under the Minimum Wages Act, for settlement of the cases before the Lok
Adalath, which is on the basis of the mutual agreement between the parties, shuts down all the
approaches for a re- assessment of the compensation by the appellate Courts. Considering this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 9
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
aspect, a slightly higher wages have been set down as guidelines and we do not see any reason to
have any qualms with the same. However, such guidelines cannot take the place of a statutory
guidelines and therefore, we hold that it would be proper to rely on the wages fixed under the
Minimum Wages Act and the Tribunal has to consider the minimum wages prescribed under the
Minimum Wages Act, as a guideline and assess whether the deceased was a skilled or unskilled
labourer. The range of a highly skilled labourer and unskilled labourer could be considered by the
Tribunals, if there is no other proof of income. We hasten to add that the notional income cannot be
adopted, with precision, as prescribed under the Minimum Wages Act also, but it acts as beacon
only.
- 20 -
34. It is also pertinent to note that the Minimum Wages Act, prescribes the wages and VDA for the
period from 01-04-2013 to 31-03-2014 as below:
"Notification No.KAE 26 LMW 2011 Dtd:9.01.2013 Published in Gazette
dtd.09.01.2013 Cost of Living Allowance to be paid over and above 4284 points Cost
of Living Index: 5075-4284 = 791 points Minimum wages and VDA from 01.04.2013
to 31.03.2014 SCHEDULE Minimum rates of wages Sl Class of No. Employment Per
day Per month 1 High skilled Basic 225-00 5850-00 VDA 36-50 949-20 Total 261-50
6799-20 2 Skilled Basic 215-00 5590-00 VDA 36-50 949-20 Total 261-50 6539-20 3
Semi-skilled Basic 190-00 4940-00 VDA 36-50 949-20 Total 226-50 5889-20 4 Un
skilled Basic 175-00 4550-00 VDA 36-50 949-20 Total 211-50 5499-20
35. The guidelines fixed by the Legal Services Authority for the year 2011 is, "Rs.5,500/- to
Rs.6,500/-"; and for the year 2013,
- 21 -
is "Rs.7,000/- to Rs.8,000/-". As observed above, it is slightly higher than the income prescribed
under the Minimum Wages Act.
36. Coming to the case on hand, the deceased Sudhakar was working as a loader and it can be said
that he was a skilled worker. The accident occurred in the year 2011. The minimum wage prescribed
under the Minimum Wages Act, is, "Rs.5,499/- for unskilled to Rs.6,799/- for high skilled for the
year 2013". Therefore, the income of the deceased is taken at Rs.6,000/- per month by considering
the fact that accident was in 2011 and it was in Bangalore which is in Zone-I.
37. The next question that falls for consideration is, whether the petitioners are dependants or not.
There cannot be any doubt that the petitioners are the grandmother, brother and sister of the
deceased. It has come in the evidence that the parents of the deceased are not alive and only the
brother and sister of the deceased were depending upon the earnings of the deceased. Therefore, we
are of the considered opinion that the petitioners being the class II legal heirs are entitled for the
compensation and there cannot be any distinction that they are entitled only for the estate of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43016834/ 10
Smt Mariyamma vs Sri Suyambulingam V on 6 December, 2022
deceased.
- 22 -
38. Under these circumstances, we re-assess the compensation under different heads as below:
• Towards loss of dependency: the income of the deceased was taken at Rs.6,000/-
per month and by providing escalation of the income towards the future prospects at
40%, the total income is calculated as "Rs.2400+ Rs.6,000/-= Rs.8,400/-". By
adopting multiplier of '18' and deducting 50% of the income towards the personal
expenses of the deceased as he was a bachelor, the loss of dependency is calculated
as, "Rs.8,400/- x 12 x 18 x 50% =Rs.9,07,200/-." • The Tribunal has considered the
medical expenses of Rs.62,000/- even though the bills were submitted to the tune of
Rs.67,000/-, on the ground that the transportation expenses were also included in
the same. We do not intend to interfere in the same and therefore, the petitioners are
entitled for sum of Rs.62,000/- under the said head. • The petitioners are the
dependents of the deceased and therefore, a sum of Rs.40,000/- is awarded to each
of them towards the loss of love and affection by relying upon the decision in the case
of Magma General Insurance
- 23 -
Company Limited V. Nanuram @ Chuhru Ram and others11 .
• It is also relevant to note that as per the decision in the case of National Insurance
Company limited V. Pranay Sethi and others12 at para 52, it is held that at every
three years there should be an escalation in these heads also and we do not intend to
adopt the same for the reason that the petitioners are not the parents of the deceased.
By adopting the principles enunciated in Pranay Sethi's case, we award the funeral
expenses of Rs.15,000/- and loss of estate at Rs.15,000/-. Thus, the compensation
payable to the appellant is, Rs.11,19,200/-. By deducting 20% from the above
amount, which is Rs.2,23,840/-, the compensation entitled by the petitioners would
be Rs.8,95,360/-. The Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.4,02,000/- and therefore,
the difference would be Rs.4,93,360/-.
39. Thus, the present appeal deserves to be allowed in part.
Hence, we pass the following:
