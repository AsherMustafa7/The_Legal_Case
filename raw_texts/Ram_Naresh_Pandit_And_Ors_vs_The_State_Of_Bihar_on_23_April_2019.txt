Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
they vexed his niece in order to procure the same from her parents. Whereupon, his niece used to
inform them. On account of poverty, they were not able to fulfil the demand and in the aforesaid
background, in the night of 29/30.06.2015, his niece has been murdered by her husband Sujit
Kumar Pandit, in laws Ram Naresh Pandit, Bhagirathi Devi, Mankesh Kumar Pandit and Shila
Kumari and further, in order to remove the evidence of crime burnt the dead body at the deserted
brick-kiln of one Jai Prakash Singh. It has also been disclosed that they have received information
from an unknown over mobile.
4. After registration of Panapur P. S. Case No.67 of 2015, investigation commenced and culminated
by way of having the appellants on trial while Shila Kumari has been exonerated which concluded
with the ultimate result, subject matter of instant appeal.
5. Defence case as is evident from mode of cross-examination as well as statement recorded under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. is that of complete denial. Furthermore, it has also been pleaded that
deceased was suffering from so many disease including heart disease and for that, she was treated at
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 I.G.I.M.S., Patna, Sahyog Hospital,
Patna as well as she was also treated at local level and to substantiate the same, two DWs have been
examined including Dr. Raj Kishore Singh and further, got the relevant prescription an exhibit of
the record.
6. Altogether ten PWs have been examined on behalf of prosecution viz. PW-1, Nagina Pandit,
PW-2, Birendra Prasad, PW-3, Lila Devi, PW-4, Manish Kumar Prasad, PW-5, Shailesh Prasad,
PW-6, Jitendra Prasad, PW-7, Navin Kumar Singh, PW-8, Ram Narayan Pandit, PW-9, Rangila
Pandit and PW-10, Manoj Kumar Sah. Side by side, also exhibited as Exhibit-1, signature of
informant over written report, Exhibit-2, written report, Exhibit-3, endorsement, Exhibit-3/1,
formal F.I.R., Exhibit-4, seizure list. In likewise manner, two DWs have also been examined at the
end of the defence namely DW-1, Dr. Raj Kishore Singh and DW-2, Lallan Pandit and had also
exhibited as Exhibit-A series, the prescription issued by DW-1, Exhibit-B, the death certificate,
Exhibit-C, signature of a doctor over ultra-sound report, Exhibit-D, the prescription issued by
I.G.I.M.S. Patna, Exhibit-E, the prescription issued by Sahyog Hospital.
7. It has been submitted at the end of the learned counsel for the appellants that the judgment
impugned is not at Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 all sustainable in
the eye of law, because of the fact that none of the ingredients attracting conviction under Section
304B of the I.P.C. is found duly substantiated from the evidences having on the record. In order to
justify the same, it has been submitted that first of all, conduct of the parties has to be seen. The
marriage is three years prior to the date of occurrence. The informant PW-6 has stated that his last
visit was one year prior to the date of occurrence. Had there been demand of dowry and for that, the
deceased would have been treated with cruelty or torture, then in that circumstance, their presence
would have been certainly during the intervening period. Having complete absence at the end of the
prosecution to have their presence during the intervening period is indicative of the fact that neither
there was demand nor deceased was subjected to torture. Apart from this, it has also been submitted
that had there been demand followed with torture, then in that circumstance, the prosecution would
have taken necessary legal steps to ward off such kind of activity, but again there happens to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29817608/ 3
Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
silence at the end of the prosecution on that very score. Apart from this, the witnesses, on account of
their contradictory statement made themselves unreliable, untrustworthy, incredible and so, over all
perception did not justify the finding.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019
8. Contrary to it, it has been submitted that having presence of medical prescription of renowned
institution of a State of Bihar i.e. I.G.I.M.S. is indicative of the fact that deceased was suffering from
some sort of severe ailment since before and on account of poverty, the appellants could not succeed
having treatment continued at that place. Though taken all sincere effort to have proper medical
care at the local level, which DW-1, Dr. Raj Kishore Singh has properly substantiated, followed with
issuance of death certificate at his end divulging the death due to ailment under his treatment and
that being so, the obligation having over the accused in terms of Section 113B of the Evidence Act is
found duly discharged. So, submitted that the judgment of conviction and sentence recorded by the
learned lower Court is fit to be set aside.
9. In an alternative, it has also been submitted that whole things happen to be connected one. In
usual phenomenon, the prosecution party getting presence of an advocate at their end and for that,
PW-6 had admitted, but with an explanation that happens to be his relative, in order to coerce, got
this case filed suppressing the earlier version, which as is evident from the evidence of PW-1 is found
duly exposed whereupon, the present F.I.R. happens to be inadmissible in the Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 eye of law on account of being hit by Section 162 of the
Cr.P.C. So, the whole prosecution is found completely gutted down. In any view of the matter, the
judgment impugned is non- sustainable in the eye of law.
10. On the other hand, learned Additional Public Prosecutor counter-meeting the submission having
at the end of the appellants has submitted that prosecution happens to be fair. In likewise manner,
from the judgment impugned, it is evident that all the points whatever been raised at the end of the
appellants, at the present moment have already properly answered. That being so, nothing remains.
11. Apart from this, it has also been submitted that during the consideration of the defence witness,
it is apparent that the documents whichever been exhibited, more particularly that of I.G.I.M.S. did
not connect identity of the deceased to be the patient and in likewise manner, the Sahyog Hospital,
which also, for want of examination of the treating doctor goes out of consideration, more
particularly when the prescription did not find place with regard to registration of the aforesaid
hospital in order to justify its existence. Coming to the remaining prescriptions, it has been
submitted that DW-1 has come in order to rescue otherwise, when the same is tallied with Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 the prescription issued by the I.G.I.M.S. as
well as Sahyog Hospital, its validity, genuineness, authentication go out of consideration. That
means to say, the defence could not be able to discharge its obligation in accordance with Section
113B of the Evidence Act.
12. In the background of aforesaid status of the defence, now the case of the prosecution has to be
seen in order to trace out whether all the ingredients so prescribed for attracting Section 304B of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29817608/ 4
Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
I.P.C. has properly been brought up on the record. To justify the same, it has been submitted that
death within three years of marriage that means to say, within seven years of marriage, the statutory
period is admitted. None of the prosecution party was at the sasural of the deceased at the time of
occurrence and so, they could not say what kind of methodology was used for commission of the
dowry death of the deceased, but even accepting the version of the defence not admitted, she died
otherwise than normal circumstance. Then, it has been submitted that with regard to demand of
dowry and torture having meted out upon the deceased in order to facilitate the same by the
husband and his family members is found duly substantiated. That being so, the judgment of
conviction and sentence recorded by the learned lower Court is found in Patna High Court CR. APP
(SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 accordance with law as well as is based upon the material
available on the record. The same is fit to be confirmed.
13. Before coming to adjudicate upon the main issue, the ancillary events are to be noted down. Out
of ten witnesses so adduced on behalf of prosecution, all the co- villager of the appellants namely
PW-5, Shailesh Prasad, PW-7, Navin Kumar Singh, PW-8, Ram Narayan Pandit and PW-9, Rangila
Pandit have gone volte-face to the prosecution, whereupon have been declared hostile. PW-10,
Manoj Kumar Sah is the I.O. The material evidence remains that of PW-1, who happens to be the
brother of the informant, uncle of the deceased, PW-2, father of the deceased, PW-3, mother of the
deceased, PW-4, brother of the deceased and PW-6, the informant, the uncle of the deceased. Only
family members have come forward to depose. Because of the fact that death occurred otherwise
than normal circumstances within seven years of marriage are not under controversy, in likewise
manner, dead body burning at the deserted brick-kiln of Jai Prakash Singh has also not denied,
therefore, the evidences are to be seen relating to remaining ingredients of Section 304B I.P.C. In
the present moment, it looks worthwhile to mention that appellants were alternatively charged
under Section 302 I.P.C., Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019
whereunder they have been acquitted. The other infirmity so persisting on record is concerning
non-examination of seizure list witness as well as non-production of seized articles having from
deserted brick-kiln. Its impact will be seen later on.
14. PW-1 has deposed that his niece Rinki Devi was married with Sujit Kumar on 26.06.2012. After

In Para-3, he has stated that the place where the dead body was burnt, happens to be

bone, ash, parts of bamboo. One pair Payal was recovered and for that, seizure list
was prepared in presence of Dinanath Pandit and Mokhtar Pandit (Exhibited),

has stated that all the seized articles have been kept in P.S. Malkhana. He had not

Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
sent the burns to the Forensic Science Laboratory in order to ascertain whether the
dead body happens to be that of female or male. Paras-11, 12, 13 contradiction
relating to witnesses Lila Devi, Birendra Prasad, Manish Kumar Pandit. Then has
denied the suggestion that he had investigated the case in perfunctory manner.
21. DW-1, Dr. Raj Kishore Singh, who has come to depose that on 02.03.2015, he had
examined Rinki Devi, wife of Sujit Kumar Pandit. She was suffering from some kind
of liver disease. On 06.02.2015, he had prescribed test. Further stated that she was
treated on 08.04.2015, 11.05.2015, 13.06.2015, 18.06.2015. He had further stated
that Rinki Devi died during course of treatment and for that, he had issued certificate
(Exhibited). He has further stated that deceased was also treated at Sahyog Hospital
Patna, I.G.I.M.S. Patna. During cross-
examination, he has stated that he happens to be physician as well as surgeon, as he has got
M.B.B.S. Degree. He has stated that clinic belongs to Rajesh Kumar Gupta and he used to visit on
call. In Para-9, he has stated that pathological examination was not conducted in his presence. Then
has denied that though Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 he had not
mentioned that he had issued certificate on a request of guardian of the deceased, but he had issued
the same on such request.
22. DW-2 is a relative of the appellants, who has come to depose that deceased was suffering from
heart disease as well as liver disease and on account thereof, her treatment was provided at the
I.G.I.M.S. as well as Sahyog Hospital (Exhibited). During cross-examination at Para-4, he has
admitted that marriage was solemnized in the Year 2012. He is not remembering the date, month,
year of the death of deceased. In Para-5, he has stated that for the first time, he has seen the
signature of Dr. V. Verma, in likewise manner, Dr. Sandeep Kumar of Sahyog Hospital.
23. In order to constitute a dowry death, the prosecution is under obligation to substantiate
following ingredients:-
A) Death should be within seven years of marriage. B) By bodily injury, burnt or
otherwise than normal circumstance.
C) Soon before her death, deceased was subjected to torture or harassment for
demand of dowry or, D) At the end of husband or relative of her husband.
24. After satisfying the aforesaid ingredients, in Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017
dt.23-04-2019 terms of Section 113B of the Evidence Act, it will be presumed to be a dowry death
and in the aforesaid eventuality, such presumption is liable to be rebutted at the end of the accused.
Furthermore, it is also settled at rest by catena of decisions that there should not be straight jacket
formula in appreciating as well as adjudging the time schedule relating to soon before death rather it
should be seen in the background of facts of the individual case and so, it has to construe
independently in the background of facts of each case. Now, after discussing the evidences having
led at the end of the prosecution as well as defence, it has to be seen whether prosecution has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29817608/ 10
Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
substantiated its case or not and if so, to what extent the defence has been able to rebutt. At the
present moment, it should not be lost sight of that the activity of the defence is found only to the
extent of preponderance of probabilities. Defence is not at all faced with same measurement than,
that of prosecution.
25. It is needless to say that death is admitted and as it appears otherwise than normal
circumstance. In likewise manner, within seven years of marriage as apart from prosecution
witnesses, DW-2 has also admitted that marriage was solemnized in the Year 2012 and death is of
29.06.2015, approximately three years after the marriage. So, certainly Patna High Court CR. APP
(SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 within seven years of marriage. Now, the remaining two
ingredients have to be seen that means to say, soon before her death, she was subjected to torture by
her husband or relative of the husband. There happens to be consistent evidence of the PW-2, the
father, PW-3, mother and PW-4, the brother that PW- 2 had received telephonically information at
the end of the deceased on 27th that if they are not going to fulfil the demand of dowry to a tune of
Rs.One lac as well as a golden chain a demand persisting since before, then in that circumstance, her
sasuralwala is not going to allow her to live. As is evident, PW- 2, father has not been
cross-examined on that very score. He was not cross-examined whether his daughter had got mobile
phone or not and if so, the mobile number. Being father, he was the fit person to answer, but
defence though tested from mother, but did not dare to cross-examine him. He has not been cross-
examined whether from Delhi, he visited the place or not and with regard to demand of dowry, from
his daughter/ deceased as during cross-examination at Para-10, he had categorically stated that
accused persons were demanding from her daughter. Accused persons had not demanded from him.
Furthermore, from Para-12, it is evident that he had categorically stated that he had not informed
anybody nor any official with regard to Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017
dt.23-04-2019 demand of dowry as well as police. The activity of the accused is found further
exposed from cross-examination at Para-14 whereunder accused has tendered a question
whereupon he answered, he has not talked with accused for compromise. Then has denied the
suggestion that he was demanding hefty money for compromising the case. In likewise manner,
PW-1, his brother (uncle of the deceased) has not been tested. PW-3, mother of the deceased, during
cross-examination at Para-5 had categorically stated that information was received by PW-2, father
of the deceased by the deceased. On her own, she had stated that the police was informed, police had
gone to the victim. At that very time, she was at Delhi, what action police had taken is known to her
husband, however, no cross- examination over the demand. PW-4, the brother, during cross-
examination at Para-5 has stated that accused persons were demanding Rs. One lac and a golden
chain from his sister since before the occurrence. PW-6, informant during course of cross-
examination at Para-6 had stated that accused persons have not demanded dowry from him.
26. Now, coming over the evidence of defence.
There happens to be Exhibit-D, the prescription issued by I.G.I.M.S. (outdoor patient, cardiology)
wherefrom it is evident Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 that it
happens to be relating to patient Rinki Devi and at the place of father, husband name, there happens
to be remark 'self'. The first endorsement happens to be dated 11.03.2015 and the second dated
25.03.2015. So many test have been prescribed, but none of the same has been made available. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29817608/ 11
Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
second happens to be Exhibit-E, the O.P.D. Card allegedly of Sahyog Hospital, it is dated
20.03.2015, that means to say, when the patient was examined on 11.03.2015 and at second time on
25.03.2015 I.G.I.M.S. then how in between, she came to Sahyog Hospital on 20.03.2015 without
having any reference that she was ever examined at I.G.I.M.S. Patna on 11.03.2015. Exhibit-A series
happen to be the prescription issued by DW-1 and the first one is of dated 03.02.2015 that means to
say, before examination at I.G.I.M.S. wherein liver disease has been shown while the patient was
examined at Cardiology Department at I.G.I.M.S. Then there happens to be a different reports and
again happen to be the prescription dated 08.04.2015, the diagnosis differ from whatever been
under the I.G.I.M.S., without any reference thereof, 11.05.2015, 13.06.2015, 18.06.2015, then the
death certificate dated 29.06.2015.
27. It is settled principle of law that evidence in its totality is to be seen. Furthermore, in Gian Chand
& others vs. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 State of Haryana
reported in 2013(4) P.L.J.R. 7 (S.C.), it has been held:-
"11. The effect of not cross-examining a witness on a particular fact/circumstance has
been dealt with and explained by this Court in Laxmibai (Dead) Thr. L.Rs. & Anr. v.
Bhagwanthuva (Dead) Thr. L.Rs. & Ors., AIR 2013 SC 1204 observing as under:
"31. Furthermore, there cannot be any dispute with respect to the settled legal
proposition, that if a party wishes to raise any doubt as regards the correctness of the
statement of a witness, the said witness must be given an opportunity to explain his
statement by drawing his attention to that part of it, which has been objected to by
the other party, as being untrue. Without this, it is not possible to impeach his
credibility. Such a law has been advanced in view of the statutory provisions
enshrined in Section 138 of the Evidence Act, 1872, which enable the opposite party
to cross-examine a witness as regards information tendered in evidence by him
during his initial examination in chief, and the scope of this provision stands
enlarged by Section 146 of the Evidence Act, which permits a witness to be
questioned, inter-alia, in order to test his veracity. Thereafter, the unchallenged part
of his evidence is to be relied upon, for the reason that it is impossible for the witness
to explain or elaborate upon any doubts as Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950
of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 regards the same, in the absence of questions put to him with
respect to the circumstances which indicate that the version of events provided by
him, is not fit to be believed, and the witness himself, is unworthy of credit. Thus, if a
party intends to impeach a witness, he must provide adequate opportunity to the
witness in the witness box, to give a full and proper explanation. The same is
essential to ensure fair play and fairness in dealing with witnesses." (Emphasis
supplied) (See also: Ravinder Kumar Sharma v. State of Assam & Ors., AIR 1999 SC
3571; Ghasita Sahu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 2008 SC 1425; and Rohtash
Kumar v. State of Haryana, JT 2013 (8) SC 181)."
12. The defence did not put any question to the Investigating Officer in his cross-examination in
respect of missing chits from the bags containing the case property/contraband articles. Thus, no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/29817608/ 12
Ram Naresh Pandit And Ors vs The State Of Bihar on 23 April, 2019
grievance could be raised by the appellants in this regard."
28. The deficiency having at the end of the prosecution that by which mobile number prosecution
party was informed and by whom, is not at all found fatal to the prosecution case in the background
of the fact that accused persons have not claimed that they have informed the prosecution party,
who have visited the place, participated during course of funeral and then thereafter, this case has
been Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 instituted with ulterior motive
rather, case was instituted on 30.06.2015 and from the certificate, it is evident that 29.06.2015,
death had occurred that means to say, presence of prosecution party at the place of accused persons
was on account of some sort of information regarding death of the deceased and as the accused
persons/ appellants have not claimed that they have informed, then in that circumstance, somebody
else was there, who had informed. Apart from this, though defence had not cross-examined why not
demand was made from the elders as the father and the uncle/ informant (PW-6) have categorically
stated that no demand was made from them, but with regard to demand from the deceased and
torture having inflicted on that very score, has not been properly tested and so, that part of evidence
remained intact. The evidence having led in rebuttal as discussed hereinabove speaks a lot with
regard to activity of the appellants and further, also cast doubt over its reliability.
29. Consequent thereupon, these appeals fail and are dismissed. Appellants Ram Naresh Pandit,
Bhagirathi Devi and Sujit Kumar Pandit are under custody, which they will remain till saturation of
the period while appellant Mankesh Kumar Pandit, who is on bail on account thereof, his bail bond
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.1950 of 2017 dt.23-04-2019 is hereby cancelled directing him to
surrender before the learned lower Court within fifteen (15) days, failing which learned lower Court
will be at liberty to proceed against him in accordance with law.
