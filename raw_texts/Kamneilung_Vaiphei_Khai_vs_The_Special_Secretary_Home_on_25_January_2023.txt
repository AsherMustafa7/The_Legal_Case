Kamneilung Vaiphei @ Khai vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 25 January, 2023
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] The petitioner assails the order dated 30.08.2022 of the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, subjecting him to preventive detention in exercise
of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a consequential writ of habeas corpus to
set him at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. S. Nepolean,
learned Government Advocate, appearing for respondent Nos. 1 & 2; and Mr. W.
Darakeshwar, learned Sr. PCCG, appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] The primary
ground of attack urged by Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel, is that there is
unexplained delay on the part of the State Government in disposing of the
petitioner's representation against his detention. The petitioner's representation is
dated 09.09.2022 and it was rejected on 04.10.2022. The affidavit-in-opposition filed
by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, reflects that the said
representation was received on 12.09.2022 and was rejected on 04.10.2022 after
consideration. No explanation was offered as to what steps were taken during the
interregnum for its expeditious disposal. [4] The file of the detaining authority is
produced by Mr. S. Nepolean, learned Government, and it shows that the
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail Sajiwa, forwarded 5 copies of the petitioner's
representation dated 09.09.2022 to the Inspector General of Prisons, Manipur, on
the very same day and they were received in the Directorate of Prisons, Manipur, on
that day itself. The petitioner's representation dated 09.09.2022 was then forwarded
to the Home Department by W.P. (Crl) No. 28 of 2022 Page 2 the Inspector General
of Prisons, Manipur, only on 12.09.2022. There is no explanation forthcoming from
the file as to why 3 days were taken to merely forward the said representation.
Having received the same on 12.09.2022, the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government
of Manipur, addressed a letter to the Director General of Police, Manipur, only on
15.09.2022, soliciting para-wise comments thereon. Again, no explanation is offered
as to why 3 days were taken for this simple step. Para-wise comments were furnished
by the Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence), Manipur, to the Home
Department under letter dated 19.09.2022. However, no action was taken thereon till
04.10.2022. The Note-file reflects that an entry was made therein on 23.09.2022,
adverting to the receipt of para-wise comments from the Police Department and
recommending that the petitioner's representation may be rejected. However, there
appears to have been no application of mind thereafter, till the rejection on
04.10.2022. Delays at every stage therefore remain largely unaccounted for.
[5] Be it noted that in Rajammal vs. State of T.N. and another [(1999) 1 SCC 417], the
Supreme Court observed that if delay is caused in consideration of the detenu's
representation owing to indifference or any other lapse, such delay would adversely
affect further detention of the prisoner. According to the Supreme Court, it is for the
authority concerned to explain the delay, if any, in disposing of the representation

Kamneilung Vaiphei @ Khai vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 25 January, 2023
and it is not enough to say that the delay is very short, as even longer delay can as
well be explained and so, the test is not the duration or range of delay, but how it is
explained by the authority concerned. The unexplained delay in that case was a mere
5 days.
W.P. (Crl) No. 28 of 2022 Page 3
[6] Earlier, in Professor Khaidem Ibocha Singh vs. The State of
Manipur [AIR 1972 Supreme Court 438], the Supreme Court set aside an order of
detention on the ground that there was unexplained delay of 17 days in the passing of
an order on the representation made by the detenu. [7] More recently, in Sarabjeet
Singh Mokha vs. The District Magistrate, Jabalpur, and others [(Criminal Appeal No.
1301 of 2021, decided on 29.10.2021 = 2021 SCC OnLine SC 1019], the Supreme
Court held that by delaying a decision on such representation, the State Government
denied the detenu a valuable statutory right. The Supreme Court observed that the
delay by the State Government in disposing of such representation strikes at the
heart of the procedural rights and guarantees granted to a detenu. [8] Though it is
laudable that the Government of Manipur is waging a 'war on drugs' and initiating
stringent measures to arrest the menace of illicit drug manufacture, trafficking and
marketing in and through the State of Manipur, it is equally its responsibility to
ensure that procedural safeguards are taken note of strictly so as to protect the
Constitutional and statutory rights of persons detained under preventive detention
laws. Despite this Court stating to this effect time and again, scant regard is shown by
the authorities concerned to compliance with the prescribed norms.
[9] The unexplained somnolence on the part of the State and the Police authorities in
dealing with the detenu's representation clearly indicates a lackadaisical and casual
approach on their part, which is inimical to the mandatory legal requirements in a
matter of this nature. The same would also be fatal to the very validity and
continuance of the impugned detention order. Further, the W.P. (Crl) No. 28 of 2022
Page 4 complete failure of the Central Government, viz., respondent No.4, in acting
upon the representation sounds a death knell for the impugned detention order. [10]
Before parting with the case, we may note that the petitioner also raised the
contention that his detention order had not been approved by the competent
authority under Section 9 (c) of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He asserted that non-compliance with this
statutory provision would render the detention order unsustainable. In his
affidavit-in-opposition, Dr. Mayengbam Veto, the Deputy Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, stated that the final recommendation of the Advisory Board
was yet to be received and that the final opinion as to whether or not there was
sufficient cause for the petitioner's detention could not be arrived at.
Significantly, this affidavit was filed by the Deputy Secretary on 20.12.2022. The file
of the detaining authority however disclosed that the Advisory Board considered the

Kamneilung Vaiphei @ Khai vs The Special Secretary (Home) on 25 January, 2023
petitioner's representation in its sitting held on 07.11.2022 and furnished its Report
on 11.11.2022 rejecting his representation and unanimously holding that there were
sufficient grounds to detain him under the provisions of the statute. Upon
considering the said Report, the petitioner's preventive detention order was
confirmed by the Government of Manipur on 30.11.2022 itself.
These facts reflect the level of care and attention that is being given by the State
authorities while preparing replies and filing them before this Court. A far greater
level of responsibility requires to be taken by the State authorities and an effort
should be made by them not to suppress relevant facts and information, be it for
whatsoever reason or consideration. We need say no more.
W.P. (Crl) No. 28 of 2022 Page 5
[11] The order of detention dated 30.08.2022 issued by the Special
Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All
consequential proceedings based thereon shall also stand set aside. The petitioner,
Kamneilun Vaiphei @ Khai, presently incarcerated in Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa,
shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is validly required
in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 28 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
A copy of this order shall be sent to the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur, for
information and necessary further action in the context of educating the detaining
authorities in the State of Manipur as to what are the procedural and temporal norms
that they need to adhere to while exercising power and jurisdiction under preventive
detention laws. Necessary guidance may also be given to the authorities who depose
to the affidavits to be filed before this Court to do so with a greater sense of
responsibility and with due regard to presenting the correct picture before this Court.
Again, we need say no more.
