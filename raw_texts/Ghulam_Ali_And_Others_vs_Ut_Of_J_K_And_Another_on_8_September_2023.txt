dated 26.08.2023 for alleged commission of offences under section 436/307/382/147 Indian Penal
Code has come into picture.
5. The petitioners have approached this Court with a petition CRM(M) no. 754/2023 for seeking
quashment of the FIR in reference i.e. FIR no. 0408/2023 in which this Court, vide an order dated
04.09.2023, has come to direct issuance of notice to the respondents in the said petition and
keeping on hold the production of challan by the Police but letting the investigation go on.
6. A perusal of the contents of the FIR reflects that the complaint has been registered by the
respondent no. 2 not by any version witnessed by him but as told to him by Mst. Mukhtar Begum
(petitioner's sister in law) about the fact that the petitioners had come to the village house in
Farwalla, torching it to fire with petrol, committing alleged theft and making an attempt on the life
of the said Mst. Mukhtar Begum. At the time of the alleged reported incident, the respondent no. 2,
the complainant, was said to be in Rajouri and was telephonically so informed.
7. This Court is confronted with a serious concern as to how Police is acting in the matter wherein
the two fractions are relishing lodging of counter FIRs against each other without bearing any fear of
law unto themselves and also the district law enforcement agency not proceeding against all the
concerned under preventive measures jurisdiction as envisaged under Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973.
8. Issue notice to the respondents.
9. In the meantime, in the event of the petitioners being arrested by the Investigating Officer dealing
with the investigation of FIR no. 0408/2023 dated 26.08.2023 or by the SHO Police Station,

aforementioned FIRs so registered with the Police Station Rajouri by the next date of hearing in the
