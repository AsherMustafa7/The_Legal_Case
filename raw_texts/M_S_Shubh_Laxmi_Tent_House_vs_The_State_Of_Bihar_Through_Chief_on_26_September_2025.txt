the petitioner and without any authority has
proceeded to blacklist the petitioner firm for a period
Patna High Court CWJC No.15936 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
2/6
of one year for the allegation of lack of expertise and
satisfactory completion of the work awarded to the
petitioner;
(ii) Restraining the Respondents from giving
effect to and taking any coercive action in connection
with Order bearing Memo No. 1027 dated
09.07.2025
during the pendency of the present writ application and/or the without the leave of this Hon'ble
Court."
2. Perusal of the blacklisting order, it is crystal clear that it is not a speaking or reasoned order so as
to affirm. Respondents are exercising quasi judicial function insofar as blacklisting Contractors. In
such an event, they are bound to follow the certain principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in paragraph-40 in the case of ORYX Fisheries Private Limited Versus Union of India and
Others, reported in (2010) 13 Supreme Court Cases 427. Paragraph-40 reads as under:
"40. In Kranti Associates [(2010) 9 SCC 496 :
(2010) 3 SCC (Civ) 852] this Court after considering various judgments formulated
certain principles in SCC para 47 of the judgment which are set out below : (SCC pp.
510-12) "(a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15936 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
(b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions.
(c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice that justice
must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.
(d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary exercise of
judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
(e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision-maker on relevant grounds
and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
(f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision-making process as
observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies.

(g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.
(h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and constitutional
governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts. This is virtually the lifeblood
of judicial decision-making justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15936 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
(i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges and
authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common purpose which is to
demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively considered. This is important
for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery system.
(j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and transparency.
(k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about his/her decision-making
process then it is impossible to know whether the person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of
precedent or to principles of incrementalism.
(l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct. A pretence of reasons or
'rubber- stamp reasons' is not to be equated with a valid decision-making process.
(m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial
powers. Transparency in decision-making not only makes the judges and decision-makers less
prone to errors but also makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of
Judicial Candor(1987) 100 Harv. L. Rev. 731-37.)
(n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in
decision- Patna High Court CWJC No.15936 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 making, the said requirement is
now virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of Strasbourg Jurisprudence.
See Ruiz Torija v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553] , EHRR at p. 562, para 29 and Anya v. University of
Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ 405 : 2001 ICR 847 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to Article 6 of the
European Convention of Human Rights which requires, 'adequate and intelligent reasons must be
given for judicial decisions'.
(o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the
future. Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the
essence and is virtually a part of 'due process'."
In the light of the aforementioned principles, the respondents have not adhered to the principles
while ordering blacklisting. Accordingly, the petitioner has made out a case so as to interfere with
the blacklisting order dated 09.07.2025 (Annexure-P/6 to the writ petition), it is set aside.

3. The matter is remanded to the concerned authority to pass a fresh order, after providing
opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and to proceed to pass a reasoned and speaking order.
The concerned authority is hereby directed to take note of the principles laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the Patna High Court CWJC No.15936 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 aforementioned
decision and pass orders within three months from today.
