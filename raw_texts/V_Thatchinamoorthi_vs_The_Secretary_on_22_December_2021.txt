ORDER
This writ petition is filed by the petitioner as against the order dated 20.11.2019 passed by the first
respondent removing him from service.
2.According to the petitioner, he applied for the Group IV services conducted by the respondents for
the year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, through online. He also secured 243 marks in the written
examination conducted by the first respondent and on 13.12.2019, he was provisionally selected for
appointment on direct recruitment to the post of Draughtsman. The respondents have issued a
selection intimation letter dated 28.11.2018 and by the proceedings of the second respondent dated
11.06.2019, he was appointed as Draughtsman in the Virudhunagar District. He also completed
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis his training on 12.09.2019. While so, on 04.11.209, the first
respondent issued a show cause notice that this petitioner has suppressed a criminal case which was
pending against him in Crime No.236 of 2008. The petitioner has submitted a detailed reply that
the case in Crime No.236 of 2008 was quashed by this Court in Crl.OP(MD)No.16186 of 2018 and
also placed the facts of the case before the first respondent. However, without considering the same,
the first respondent has passed the impugned order removing him from service.
3.Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the case in Crime No.236 of 2008
was registered mainly against one Balamurugan that the daughter of the defacto complainant eloped
with the said Balamurugan. On the complaint of the defacto complainant, the other students have
also been added as accused and this petitioner is also arrayed as an accused. After the registration of
the FIR, the case was also amicably settled among the parties and was subsequently quashed by this
Court in Crl.O(MD)No. 16186 of 2018, dated 10.09.2018. Without considering the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis same, the first respondent has mechanically removed the
petitioner from service.
4.He further submitted that the first respondent is not the authority to pass the impugned order,
since he is only a nodal agency for the process of recruitment and after the appointment, it is only

V.Thatchinamoorthi vs The Secretary on 22 December, 2021
the second respondent who has power to remove the petitioner from service. By relying upon the
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Avatar Singh v. Union of India and Others [AIR 2016 SC
3598], the learned Counsel submitted that a chance for reformation has to be offered to young
offenders in suitable cases, interplay of reformative theory cannot be ruled out in toto nor can be
generally applied, but is one of the facts to be taken into consideration while exercising the power of
cancelling candidature or discharging the employee from service. Therefore, he prayed for
interference.
5.Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent submitted that the first respondent has
received a complaint that this petitioner is an accused in a criminal
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis case. But, the petitioner in his application has stated that there is
no criminal case pending against him. Based on the complaint received, the first respondent vide
letter dated 09.08.2018, requested the Assistant Director, Survey and Settlement, Virudhunagar to
make an enquiry into the allegations and to furnish a report. The Assistant Director, accordingly,
filed his report on 18.09.2018 that a case was registered against this petitioner in Crime No.236 of
2008 along with 19 others on the file of the Thadikombu Police Station. The case was pending for
more than ten years and finally quashed by this Court in Crl.OP(MD)No.16186 of 2018 on the
compromise arrived between the parties.
6.Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that as on the date of notification on 14.11.2017, the
case was pending, however, the petitioner in his online application has suppressed the same and
mentioned that no criminal cases are pending against him. Therefore, they have issued a show cause
notice on 23.10.2019 and have also passed the impugned order. He has also relied upon the
instructions issued to the candidates in the notification and submitted that the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis conditions of instructions is of paramount importance and the
Courts cannot modify / relax the instructions issued by the Commission.
7.This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the available materials.
8.The petitioner is arrayed as an accused in Crime No. 236 of 2008 on the file of the Thadikombu
Police Station, for the offence under Sections 147, 148, 341, 366, 506(ii) IPC. The case was registered
on 16.07.2008 and it was quashed by this Court in Crl.OP(MD)No.16186 of 2018, dated 10.09.2018.
The notification for the Group IV services examination was issued by the first respondent on
14.11.2017. Therefore, as on the date of application, a criminal case was pending as against the
petitioner.
9.The notification dated 14.11.2017 issued by the first respondent calling for applications to the posts
included in Group IV services is placed before this Court and in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
paragraph no.19(b)(ii)(b) under the heading “Disqualification / Debarment”, it is mentioned as
follows:-
“Instructions to the Candidates:-

V.Thatchinamoorthi vs The Secretary on 22 December, 2021
19(b)(ii)(b) Suppression of material information regarding criminal cases, arrests,
convictions debarment or disqualification by Union Public Service Commission /
State Public Service Commissions.
(iii) ... that the applicant responsible for such act will be debarred from appearing for
the examinations and selections held by this Commission permanently or for such
period of years as the Commission may decide.”
10.The application dated 24.11.2017 filed by the petitioner for the posts included in the Group IV
services is also placed before this Court. A specific detail was asked for from the candidates in the
application with regard to the criminal cases, if any, registered, for which, the petitioner has replied
in negative, knowing fully well that he is having a criminal case as on that date.

11.The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in State of Tamil Nadu and Others v. G.Hemalathaa & Another [Civil
Appeal No.6669 of 2019, decided on 28.08.2019], has held as follows:-
“7. We have given our anxious consideration to the submissions made by the learned
Senior Counsel for the Respondent. The Instructions issued by the Commission are
mandatory, having the force of law and they have to be strictly complied with. Strict
adherence to the terms and conditions of the Instructions is of paramount
importance. The High Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution cannot modify/relax the Instructions issued by the Commission.
8. The High Court after summoning and perusing the answer sheet of the
Respondent was convinced that there was infraction of the Instructions.
However, the High Court granted the relief to the Respondent on a sympathetic consideration on
humanitarian ground. The judgments cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent in
Taherakhatoon (D) By LRs v. Salambin Mohammad and Chandra Singh and Others v. State of
Rajasthan and Another in support of her arguments that we should not entertain this appeal in the
absence of any substantial questions of law are not applicable to the facts of this case.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. In spite of the finding that there was no adherence to the Instructions, the High Court granted the
relief, ignoring the mandatory nature of the Instructions. It cannot be said M. Vennila v. Tamil Nadu
Public Service Commission, (2006) 3 Mad. LJ 376, (1999) 2 SCC 635, (2003) 6 SCC 545 that such
exercise of discretion should be affirmed by us, especially when such direction is in the teeth of the
Instructions which are binding on the candidates taking the examinations.
... ... ...

12. After giving a thoughtful consideration, we are afraid that we cannot approve the judgment of
the High Court as any order in favour of the candidate who has violated the mandatory Instructions
would be laying down bad law. The other submission made by Ms. Mohana that an order can be
passed by us under Article 142 of the Constitution which shall not be treated as a precedent also
does not appeal to us.”
12.In the present case on hand, though the criminal case in Crime No.236 of 2008, dated
16.07.2008, was subsequently quashed by this Court in Crl.OP(MD)No.16186 of 2018, dated
10.09.2018, on the compromise arrived upon https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis between the parties,
the fact remains that the case was pending as on the date of application on 24.11.2017 and the
petitioner has clearly suppressed the same in the online application.
13.In view of the above position and in view of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
extracted supra, this Court is not inclined to entertain this writ petition and the same is accordingly,
dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
