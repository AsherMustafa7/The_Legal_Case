judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court.
02. The short submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the petitioners
came to be engaged as Guest Lecturers and from the date of their engagement, they are performing
their duties to the best of their abilities and to the entire satisfaction of their superiors and in view of
the same, the services of the petitioners were appreciated by the Head of the Institution where they

advertisement notice which is impugned in the present petition is replacing the services of the
petitioners by another set of contractual employees, which if done, will be in violation of the law laid
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various authoritative pronouncements.
