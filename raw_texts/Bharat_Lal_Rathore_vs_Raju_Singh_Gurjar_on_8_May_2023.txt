HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH : BENCH AT
GWALIOR
SINGLE BENCH - I
MOTION HEARING
[COMMON CONDITIONAL ORDERS]
IN MATTERS NOTIFIED AT SERIAL NOS. 1001 TO 1011 ON THE
BOARD DATED : 08/05/2023
DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE OF COURT ORDER
CAUSE TITLES AND APPARANCE AS NOTIFIED
Matters from Sr. No. 1001 to 1011 are listed with office objection(s)
The Court proposes to pass a common conditional order to
obviate passing of identical conditional order in these matters
involving similar office objection/default.
In all these matters, due to non-removal of office objection within
the prescribed time as per the Rules, the concerned matter was
placed before the Registrar in the first instance. The Registrar
granted sufficient time to the petitioner(s)/ applicant(s)/ appellant(s)
to cure the defect/office objection, however, due to non-removal of
office objection/default within the prescribed time, the concerned
matter was required to be once again listed before the Court. The
Court granted further time, by passing common order on the earlier
occasion.
In spite of repeated opportunity (three times-one under Rules, second
by the Registrar and third by Court), the
petitioner(s)/applicant(s)/appellant(s) has failed to cure the office
objection/default. As a result, by way of indulgence and last
opportunity, in terms of this order, SIX WEEKS' further time is
granted to the petitioner(s)/ applicant(s)/appellant(s) in the respective
matters to remove office objection/default and make the matter ready
for further hearing within that time, failing which the concerned
petition/application/appeal shall stand dismissed for non-prosecution
without further reference to the Court.

Provided, however, in cases, where the objection/ default is about
non-service of any of the respondent, on expiry of the extended

period, the concerned matter will stand dismissed for non- prosecution only against the unserved
respondent(s), without further reference to the Court. The matter would then proceed against the
remaining respondent(s).
In cases where the office objection/default has already been cured before passing of this order, it
will be open to the concerned party to bring that fact to the notice of the Registrar (Judicial-II) who
may examine the same and proceed with the matter as per the listing scheme, if ready for hearing.
If the office objections are removed within the time extended in terms of this order, the concerned
matter(s) be made returnable on the date notified hereafter.
