Information Report.
3. Although the prayer for quashing of FIR has been made, but without insisting on the same, only
submission is that all alleged offences are punishable with imprisonment upto seven years, therefore
the police authorities are bound to follow the procedure laid down under Section 35 B.N.S.S. The
petitioner has been wrongly implicated and could not be arrested. Reliance has been placed on the

we are of the opinion that the guidelines framed by the Apex Court in the above noted judgement are
equally applicable to the facts of the instant case.
5. Accordingly, the instant petition also stands disposed of in terms of the judgements as noted
above.
