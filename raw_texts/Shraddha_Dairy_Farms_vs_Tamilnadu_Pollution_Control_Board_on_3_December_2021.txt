T h e p e t i t i o n e r i s c h a l l e n g i n g t h e p r o c e e d i n g s N o .
TNPCB/T2/F.15048/MMN/OS/Closure/W&A/2021 dated 17.08.2021 under Section 33A of Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, as amended and under Section 31A of Air
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, issued by the first respondent/Tamilnadu Pollution
Control Act represented by the Chairman. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
2.The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner/Dairy Farm is functioning in
the present place from July 1999. It has presently 72 cows. On 23.06.2021, the petitioner received
two show cause notices from the second respondent. One notice under the Water (Prevention and
Control of Pollution) Act,1974 and the other notice under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)
Act, 1981. Notice was issued on a complaint made by Thiru. Mukund Ramesh alleging that cattle
shed in the residential area is causing health hazard to near-by public. In the notice issued under
Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 the following allegations were made:
''1.The petitioner farm is running in a residential area.
2.The wastewater generated from the unit is discharged into the storm water drain.
3.The unit was operating without the consent of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control
Board.'' In another notice issued under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)
Act, 1981 the following allegations are made:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ''1.The unit is running in a residential area.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20848371/ 2
Shraddha Dairy Farms vs Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board on 3 December, 2021
2.The unit is operating without the consent of the board.'' For the above said two
notices, the petitioner issued reply on 13.07.2021.The first respondent, without any
further enquiry or personal hearing, passed the impugned order directing closure of
the Farm and also for disconnection of power supply, pursuant to above said
proceedings. The learned counsel for the petitioner/Dairy Farm contended that the
petitioner invoked this Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India on the ground that the impugned order was passed by the first respondent
without any jurisdiction. The respondents have no jurisdiction over the allegations
made against the petitioner. The first respondent has jurisdiction relating to Water
Pollution and he had no jurisdiction with regard to the location of Farm in the
residential area. The restriction under Section 25 of Water (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act, 1974 and under Section 31(A) of Air (Prevention and Control of
Pollution) Act, 1981, cannot include the petitioner’s case. The petitioner did not
discharge sewage in any https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis water body. The
petitioner/ Dairy Farm was established in July 1999 before the issuance of guidelines
for environmental management of Dairy Farms and Gaushalas. It was formed and
notified by the Central Pollution Control Board in July 2020 and revised guidelines at
July 2021.
3.The petitioner maintained the house as prescribed by the guidelines of the Government for
disposal and treatment of cow dung. They had an arrangement with M/s.Srinivas Waste
Management Services Private Limited, situated at Saligramam, Chennai. They collected cow dung in
a proper and safer manner without causing any health and environmental hazard, besides the cow
urine also was duly treated for various purposes, like natural pesticides and Hortic Culture projects.
As per the guidelines for environmental management of Dairy Farms and Gaushala, the siting
criteria is applicable for a new establishment, after the publication of the guidelines not for the
petitioner. Further, the petitioner already submitted letter on 27.01.2021 seeking consent from the
Pollution Board and is pending before the Pollution Board. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
4.We have considered the matter in the light of the submission made by the learned counsel for the
parties and the materials on record.
5.A perusal of the materials on record, indicates that complaint was received from Thiru.Mukundh
Ramesh, dated 16.06.2021. Based on the complaint the sight in question was investigated by the
Officials of the second respondent/TNPCB , MM Nagar on 23.06.2021. During inspection, it was
noticed that the functioning of Dairy Farm and manufacturing of Dairy products and the Unit are
situated in the residential areas as on date and the Board had not granted its consent and this fact is
not disputed.
6.The impugned proceedings was issued on 17.08.2021 after the investigation by the officials of the
second respondent/TNPCB, MM Nagar on 23.06.2021. The impugned order and proceedings were
issued with direction under Section 33-A of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
and under Section 31-A of Air (Prevention and Pollution Control)Act, 1981.

7.Under Section 33-B of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and under Section
31-B of Air (Prevention and Pollution Control)Act, 1981, remedy is provided to any aggrieved
person. The provision read as follows:
33-B of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, ''33-B. Appeal to National
Green Tribunal-- Any person Aggrieved by,--(a) an order or decision of the appellate
authority under Section 28, made on or after the commencement of the National
Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (19 of 2010); or
(b) an order passed by the State Government under Section 29, on or after the
commencement of the National Green Tribunal Act,2010(19 of 2010); or (c )
directions issued under Section 33-A by a Board, on or after the commencement of
the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (19 of 2010), may file an appeal to the
National Green Tribunal established under Section 3 of the National
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (19 of 2010), in
accordance with the provisions of that Act.
31-B of Air (Prevention and Pollution Control)Act, 1981 31-B. Appeal to National Green
Tribunal---Any person aggrieved by an order or decision of the Appellate Authority under Section
31, made on or after the commencement of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010,(19 of 2010), may
file an appeal to the National Green Tribunal established under Section 3 of the National Green
Tribunal Act, 2010 (19 of 2010), in accordance with the provisions of that Act.''
8. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in M.C.Mehta v. Union of India (1987 1 SCC 395) observed that
''environment courts’’ must be established for expeditious disposal of environmental cases and
ultimately, the Indian Parliament passed the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 to handle all the
cases relating to environmental issues. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9.The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan v. Union of India
(2012 8 SCC 326) has directed that the environmental issues and matters covered under the
National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 should be instituted and litigated before the National Green
Tribunal and it was further, observed that matters instituted after coming into force of this Act, are
covered under the provisions of this Act which shall stand transferred and be heard only by National
Green Tribunal. It was also observed by the Apex Court that this will help in rendering expeditious
and specialized justice in the field of environment to all concerned. The Bhopal case was transferred
to the Madhya Pradesh High Court and not to the National Green Tribunal as it involved
administrative supervision for the proper execution of the orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
10.At this juncture, we have considered the object of formation of National Green Tribunal and
while enacting the law, the Parliament states its object and reasons as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20848371/ 4
Shraddha Dairy Farms vs Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board on 3 December, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ''The rapid expansion in industrial, infrastructure
and transportation sectors and increasing urbanization in recent years have given
rise to new pressures on our natural resources and environment. There is a
commensurate increase in environment related litigation pending in various Courts
and other authorities. The risk to human health and environment arising out of
hazardous activities has also become a matter of concern.
2.India is a party to the decisions taken at the United Nations conference on the
Human Environment held at Stockholm in June, 1972, in which India participated,
calling upon the environment. The United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development held at Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992, in which India participated, has
also called upon the States to provide effective access to judicial and adminstrative
proceedings, including redress and remedy, and to develop National laws regarding
liability and compensation for the victims for the victims of pollution and other
environmental damage.
3.The right to healthy environment has been construed as a part of the right to life
under article https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 21 of the Constitution in the judicial
pronouncement in India.
4.The National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995 was enacted to provide for strict
liability for damages arising out of any accident occurring while handling any
hazardous substance and for the establishment of a National Environment Tribunal
for effective and expeditious disposal of cases arising from such accident, with a view
to giving relief and compensation for damages to persons, property and the
environment. However, the National Environment Tribunal, which had a very limited
mandate, was not established. The National Environment Appellate Authority Act,
1997 was enacted to establish the National Environment Appellate Authority to hear
appeals with respect to restriction of areas in which any industries, operations or
processes or class of industries, operations or processes shall not be carried out or
shall be carried out subject to certain safeguards under the Environment (Protection)
Act, 1986. The National Environment Appellate Authority has a limited workload
because of the narrow scope of its jurisdiction.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5.Taking into account the large number of environmental cases pending in higher Courts and the
involvement of multi disciplinary issues in such cases, the Supreme Court requested the Law
Commission of India to consider the need for constitution of specialised environmental Courts.
Pursuant to the same, the Law Commission has recommended the setting up of environmental
Courts having both original and appellate jurisdiction relating to environmental laws.
6.In view of the foregoing paragraphs, a need has been felt to establish a specialised tribunal to
handle the multi disciplinary issues involved in environmental cases. Accordingly, it has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20848371/ 5
Shraddha Dairy Farms vs Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board on 3 December, 2021
decided to enact a law to provide for the establishment of the National Green Tribunal for effective
and expeditious disposal of civil cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of
forests and other natural resources including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment.
7.Accordingly, it has been decided to introduce the National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009 which inter
alia provide:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(a) for establishment of a the National Green Tribunal which shall consist of a
Chairperson and such number of Judicial ad Expert Members as the Central
Government may notify;
(b) that a person who is or has been a judge of the Supreme Court or a Chief Justice
of a High Court shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairperson or judicial
Member of the Tribunal;
( c) that a person who is or has been a Judge of a High Court shall also be eligible for appointment as
a Judicial Magistrate.
(d) that a person who is either an expert in physical sciences or life sciences or engineering, or who
has administrative experience in dealing with environmental matters shall be qualified for
appointment as an Expert Member;
(e) that the Tribunal shall have the jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question
relating to environment (including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment),is
involved https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis and such question arises out of the implementation of
the enactments specified in the Schedule I to the Bill and to grant relief and compensation to the
victims of pollution and other environmental damage arising under the enactments specified in the
Schedule I to the Bill and to hear appeals under certain enactments specified in the Schedule III to
the Bill;
(f) the repeat of the 'National Environmental Tribunal Act, 1995' and the 'National Environment
Appellate Authority Act, 1997'.
8.The Bill seeks to achieve the aforesaid objectives''
11. The Hon'ble Supreme Court deprecated the practice of entertaining writ petitions under Article
226, of the Constitution of India though suitable alternative remedy is available in law. We ourselves
take the guidance of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Thitaghur paper Mills v. State of
Orrissa (AIR 1983 2 SCC 433) wherein the Supreme Court held as follows:
'' where the statute itself provided the petitioners with an efficacious alternative
remedy by way of an appeal to the Prescribed Authority, a second appeal to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20848371/ 6
Shraddha Dairy Farms vs Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board on 3 December, 2021
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the Tribunal and thereafter to have the case stated
to the High Court, it was not for the High Court to exercise its extraordinary
jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution ignoring as it were, the complete
statutory machinery. That it has become necessary, even now, for us to repeat this
admonition is indeed a matter of tragic concern to us. Article 226 is not meant to
short-circuit or circumvent statutory procedures. It is only where statutory remedies
are entirely ill-suited to meet the demands of extraordinary situation, as for instance
where the very vires of the statute is in question or where private or public wrongs
are so inextricably mixed up and the prevention of public injury and the vindication
of public justice require it that recourse may be had to Article 226 of the Constitution.
But then the Court must have good and sufficient reason to bypass the alternative
remedy provided by statute. Surely matters involving the revenue where statutory
remedies are available are not such matters. We can also take judicial notice of the
fact that the vast majority of the petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution are
filed solely for the purpose of obtaining interim orders and thereafter prolong the
proceedings by one device or the other. The practice certainly needs to be strongly
discouraged.'' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
12. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Premier Automobiles Limited v. Kamlekar Shantaram Wadke, [1976 1
SCC 496], The Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation v. Krishna Kant, [AIR 1995 SC 1715],
Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks, [1998 (8) SCC 1], and U.P.State Bridge
Corporation Ltd. & Others v. U.P.Rajya Setu Nigam S.Karmachari Sangh, [(2004) 4 SCC 268.], and
this Court in 'Indian Additives Limited v. Indian Additives Employees Union, 2005 Writ L.R.22 and
in Madura Sugars Staff Union & Others v. Madura Sugar Mills, 2005 Writ L.R.25, have consistently
held that when alternative remedy is available ordinarily it must be availed of.
13. In the instant case, it is an admitted fact that the petitioner is having an alternative remedy of
filing an appeal under Section 33-B of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and
under Section 31-B of Air (Prevention and Pollution Control) Act, 1981. So, we cannot approve the
practice of filing this Writ Petition before this Court, when the petitioner has a statutory and
effective alternative remedy. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
14. It must be mentioned that in extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, a Writ Petition can
be entertained even though an alternative remedy is not exhausted by the parties. In the present
case, no such extraordinary or exceptional circumstances have been shown to entertain this Writ
Petition.
15. In such view of the matter, the Writ Petition is dismissed, granting liberty to the petitioner to
prefer an Appeal. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed. No costs.
[M.K.K.S.J] [V.S.G.J] 03.12.2021 After pronouncement of the order, the learned counsel for the
petitioner represented that the order impugned in this Writ Petition was suspended by the Pollution
Control Board for a period of three months. The learned counsel seeks further suspension for three
weeks to enable the petitioner to file an Appeal.
