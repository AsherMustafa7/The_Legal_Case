COMMON JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by R. Mahadevan, J) These tax case appeals have been filed by
the appellant/Revenue, calling in question the correctness of the order dated 11.06.2010 passed by
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, 'B' Bench, Chennai, in I.T.A.Nos.1879, 1880 and
1881/MDS/2004, relating to the assessment years 1995-1996, 1996-1997 and 1997-1998,
respectively. On 08.02.2011, TC (A) No. 1307 of 2010 was admitted on the following substantial
questions of law:-
"1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in law in holding that interest on Non-performing
"Asset was not to be included in the total income of the assessee on accrual basis,
even though the assessee was following Mercantile System of accounting is valid.
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in law in holding that the disallowance of deposit
mobilization expenses amounting to Rs.52,52,593/- even though the aforesaid sum
was never disallowed by the assessing officer either in the original assessment or the
re-assessment was made by the Assessing Officer? and
3. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the re-opening of the Assessment under
Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was issued beyond the four years, even
though, before the Assessing Officer issue of brokerage was never considered in the
original assessment or re-assessment nor were the details produced by the assessee
in the course of assessment."

2. Similarly, on 08.02.2021, TCA Nos. 1308 and 1309 of 2010 were also admitted by this Court on
the following substantial question of law:-
(i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal was right in law in holding that interest on Non-performing Asset
was not to be included in the total income of the assessee on accrual basis, even
though the assessee was following Mercantile System of accounting is valid?
3. When these appeals are taken up for consideration today, the learned counsel for the
appellant/Revenue brought to the notice of this court the Circular No.17/2019 dated 08.08.2019
issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, wherein, it is stipulated that appeals shall not be

filed/pursued by the Department before the High Court in cases where the tax effect does not exceed
Rs.1,00,00,000/- (Rupees One Crore). It is also submitted that the tax effect in these appeals is less
than the threshold limit.
4. Notwithstanding the above, one of the issues involved in these appeals namely "whether interest
on Non-performing Asset was not to be included in the total income of the assessee on accrual basis,
even though the assessee was following Mercantile System of accounting is valid" is covered by the
decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax
vs. Vasisth Chay Vyapar Limited reported in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos. 1307, 1308
and 1309 of 2010 (2011) 330 ITR 044, which was subsequently confirmed by the Honourable
Supreme court in the order dated 13.12.2017 passed in Civil Appeal No. 5811 of 2012 etc., batch. The
decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court can profitably be extracted hereunder:-
"17. In this scenario, we have to examine the strength in the submission of learned
counsel for the Revenue that whether it can still be held that income in the form of
interest though not received had still accrued to the assessee under the provisions of
Income Tax Act and was, therefore, eligible to tax. Our answer is in the negative and
we give the following reasons in support:-
(1) First of all we would discuss the matter in the light of the provisions of Income
Tax Act and to examine as to whether in the given circumstances, interest income has
accrued to the assessee. It is stated at the cost of repetition that admitted position is
that the assessee had not received any interest on the said ICD placed with Shaw
Wallce since the assessment year 1996-97 as it had become NPAs in accordance with
the Prudential norms which was entered in the books of accounts as well. The
assessee has further successfully demonstrated that even in the succeeding
assessment years, no interest was received and the position remained the same until
the assessment years 2006-07. Reason was adverse financial circumstances and the
financial crunch faced by Shaw Wallace. So much so, it was facing winding up
petitions which were filed by many creditors. These circumstances, led to an
uncertainty in so far as recovery of interest was concerned, as a result of the aforesaid
precarious financial position of Shaw Wallace. What to talk of interest, even the
principal amount itself had become doubtful to recover. In this scenario it was
legitimate move to infer that interest income thereupon has not "accrued". We are in
agreement with the submission of Mr. Vohra on this count, supported by various
decisions of different High Courts including this court which has already been
referred to above.
(2) In the instant case, the assessee company being NBFC is governed by the
provisions of RBI Act. In such a case, interest https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA
Nos. 1307, 1308 and 1309 of 2010 income cannot be said to have accrued to the
assessee having regard to the provisions of section 45Q of the RBI and Prudential
Norms issued by the RBI in exercise of its statutory powers. As per these norms, the
ICD had become NPA and on such NPA where the interest was not received and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94909725/ 3
The Commissioner Of Income Tax-I vs M/S. Elgi Finance Limited on 7 December, 2021
possibility of recovery was almost nil, it could not be treated to have been accrued in
favour of the assessee.
18. As noted above, Mr. Sabharwal, argued that the case of the assessee was to be dealt with for the
purpose of taxability as per the provisions of the Act and not the RBI Act which was the accounting
method that the assessee was supposed to follow. We have already held that even under the Income
Tax Act, interest income had not accrued. Moreover, this submission of Mr. Sabharwal is based
entirely on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Southern Technology (supra). No
doubt, in first blush, reading of the judgment gives an indication that the Court has held that RBI
Act does not override the provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, when we examine the issue
involved therein minutely and deeply in the context in which that had arisen and certain
observations of the Apex Court contained in that very judgment, we find that the proposition
advanced by Mr. Sabharwal may not be entirely correct. In the case before the Supreme Court, the
assessee a NBFC debited Rs.81,68,516 as provision against NPA in the profit and loss account, which
was claimed as deduction in terms of Section 36 (1) (vii) of the Act. The assessing officer did not
allow the deduction claimed as aforesaid on the ground that the provision of NPA was not in the
nature of expenditure or loss but more in the nature of a reserve, and thus not deductible under
Sectrion 36 (i) (vii) of the Act. The assessing officer, however, did not bring to tax Rs.20,34,605 as
income (being income accrued under the mercantile system of accounting). The dispute before the
Apex court centered around deductibility of provision for NPA. After analyzing the provisions of the
RBI Act, their Lordships of the Apex Court observed that in so far as the permissible deductions or
exclusions under the Act are concerned, the same are admissible only if such deductions/exclusions
satisfy the relevant conditions stipulated therefor under the Act. To that extent, it was observed that
the Prudential Norms do not override the provisions of the Act. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
TCA Nos. 1307, 1308 and 1309 of 2010 However, the Apex Court made a distinction with regard to
"Income Recognition" and held that income had to be recognized in terms of the Prudential Norms,
even though the same deviated from mercantile system of accounting and/or Section 45 of the
Income Tax Act. It can be said, therefore, that the Apex Court approved the 'real income" theory
which is engrained in the Prudential Norms for recognition of revenue by NBFC. The following
passage from the judgment of the Apex Court would bring out the distinction noticed by the Apex
Court between permissible deductions/exclusions, on the one hand, and income recognition on the
other:-
........
40. At the outset, we may state that in essence RBI Directions 1998 are
Prudential/Provisioning Norms issued by RBI under Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act,
1934. These Norms deal essentially with Income Recognition. They force the NBFCs
to disclose the amount of NPA in their financial accounts. They force the NBFCs to
reflect "true and correct" profits. By virtue of Section 45Q, an overriding effect is
given to the Directions 1998 vis-a-vis "income recognition" principles in the
Companies Act, 1956. These Directions constitute a code by itself. However, these
Directions 1998 and the IT Act operate in different areas.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/94909725/ 4
The Commissioner Of Income Tax-I vs M/S. Elgi Finance Limited on 7 December, 2021
These Directions 1998 have nothing to do with computation of taxable income. These Directions
cannot overrule the "permissible deductions" or "their exclusion" under the IT Act. The
inconsistency between these Directions and Companies Act is only in the matter of Income
Recognition and presentation of Financial Statements. The Accounting Policies adopted by an NBFC
cannot determine the taxable income. It is well settled that the Accounting Policies followed by a
company can be changed unless the AO comes to the conclusion that such change would result in
understatement of profits. However, here is the case where the AO has to follow the RBI Directions
1998 in view of Section 45Q of the RBI Act. Hence, as far as Income Recognition is concerned,
Section 145 of the IT Act has no role to play in the present dispute."
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis TCA Nos. 1307, 1308 and 1309 of 2010
19. We have also noticed the other line of cases wherein the Supreme Court itself has held that when
there is a provision in other enactment which contains a non-obstante clause, that would override
the provisions of Income Tax Act. TRO Vs. Custodian, Special Court Act (supra) is one such case
apart from other cases of different High Courts. When the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Southern Technology (supra) is read in manner we have read, it becomes easy to reconcile the ratio
of Southern Technology with TRO Vs. Custodian, Special Court Act.
20. Thus viewed from any angle, the decision of the Tribunal appears to be correct in law. The
question of law is thus decided against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee. As a result, all
these appeals are dismissed."
5. In the light of the above coupled with the legal position enunciated by the Honourable Supreme
Court, the substantial questions of law raised in these appeals are answered against the revenue and
in favour of the assessee and hence the present appeals are dismissed. No costs.
