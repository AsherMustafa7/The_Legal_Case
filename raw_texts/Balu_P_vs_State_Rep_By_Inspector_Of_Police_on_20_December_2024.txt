Challenging the order of dismissal dated 18.09.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.9688 of 2024 by the learned
Principal Special Judge under EC & NDPS, Chennai, the petitioner, who is the owner of the vehicle
viz., Goods Carrier (Lorry), bearing Reg.No.TN-12-BD-2985, is before this Court with the present
Revision, for return of vehicle.
2. Mr.V.M.Venkataramana, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the
petitioner purchased the vehicle viz., Goods Carrier (Lorry), bearing Reg.No.TN-12-BD-2985,
during April, 2024 and the Registration was done in his name on 25.05.2024. The petitioner
purchased the vehicle for Rs.19,20,140/- with a loan amount of Rs.18,32,667/-. The petitioner is
paying the monthly EMI of Rs.44,180/- and he has to pay the monthly EMI from 15.06.2024 to
15.04.2029 for a period of five years. This being so, the petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
vehicle has been seized in Crime No.222 of 2024 and from then on the vehicle has been detained by
the respondent and kept in open yard exposing to rain and shine and the value of vehicle is getting
diminished. Further, the vehicle to become unusable, turning to get rusted and scrap. In support of
his ownership, the petitioner produced Registration Certificate, MV Tax Receipt, Vehicle Insurance,
vehicle permit and HDB Financial Service letter. Along with the vehicle, 131 Rolls of Garments
Fabrics also seized. He further submitted that A1 and A2 in Crime No.222 of 2024 were arrested and
remanded on 12.08.2022, for illicit transport of 55.600 Kgs of Ganja using the petitioner's vehicle
viz., Goods Carrier (Lorry), bearing Reg.No.TN-12-BD-2985. From the lorry, 55.600 Kgs of Ganja, a
commercial quantity and 131 Rolls of Garments Fabrics seized. The seized articles produced before
the lower Court in A.No.1116/2024 and B.No.621/2024. The petitioner claiming that he is Managing
Partner of M/s.Simadhiri Transport Service, a Transport Company entered into an agreement for
transportation of goods on regular basis with Teejay India Pvt.Ltd., a Fabric Manufacturing

Pvt.Ltd., for transportation of cotton bundle consignment from Visakhapatnam to Tuticorin and the

Balu P vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 20 December, 2024
and transported 58 Kgs of Ganja along with garment bales. The consignment was to be delivered to
Tuticorin Harbour and from there to Colombo.
3. Mr.Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, the learned State Public Prosecutor would submit that as regards
the return of 131 Rolls of Garments Fabrics, the lower Court granted return of articles in
Crl.M.P.No.9338 of 2024 on 09.09.2024. As regards, the the return of vehicle, viz., Goods Carrier
(Lorry), bearing Reg.No.TN-12-BD-2985, the return of Property petition in Crl.M.P.No.9688 of
2024 was dismissed by order dated 18.09.2024, since commercial quantity was seized from the
vehicle. Hence, he strongly objected for allowing the Revision.
4. The learned State Public Prosecutor vehemently opposed the petition submitting that return of
property in the NDPS Act Cases cannot be entertained invoking Sections 457 and 451 of Cr.P.C., and
it is liable for confiscation under Section 52-A, 60, 61 and 63 of NDPS Act., unless the owner of the
conveyance proves that the conveyance https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis was used without his
knowledge and connivance, he has taken all reasonable precaution against such use. In support of
his contention, the learned State Public Prosecutor relied on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Suresh Nanda Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in (2008) 3 SCC 674
to stress the point that, where there is a special Act dealing with subject, resort should be to that Act
instead of general Act providing for the matter connected with the specific Act. He stressed his
argument mainly on Union of India Vs. Mohanlal and Another reported in (2016) 3 SCC 379,
wherein the Apex Court has given directions for storage, seizure and sampling, handling and
disposal of seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Considering the piquant situation in
which accumulation of huge quantities of seized drugs and narcotics increased the chances of their
pilferage for re-circulation in the market and also finding that despite Central Government Standing
Order No.1/1989 and two subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015 giving
directions, directing that no sooner seizure of any narcotic and psychotropic and controlled
substances and conveyances is effected, the same shall be forwarded to the officer in-charge of the
nearest police station or to the officer empowered under Section 53 of the Act and Section 52-A(2) of
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Act. The sampling shall be done under the supervision of the
Magistrate and the Central and State Government and its agencies within six months from the date
of the order take appropriate steps to set up storage facilities for the exclusive storage of seized
narcotic and psychotropic substances and conveyances, duly equipped with vaults and
double-locking system to prevent theft, pilferage or replacement of the seized drugs. Further, the
Apex Court given direction to constitute Drug Disposal Committee and disposal of seized drugs lying
in the Police Malkhanas and other places used for storage of drugs and psychotropic substances.
5. The learned State Public Prosecutor would further submit that this Court in Crl.R.C(MD)No.41 of
2019 in the case of Nahoorkani Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu on 16.06.2023 held that when the
conveyance is seized under NDPS Act, the return of property does not arise as contemplated under
Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C., and it is liable to be confiscated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act in
the light of special procedure under Section 52-A of the Act. Any person claiming the ownership or
right of the conveyance may approach the concerned Drug Disposal Committee directly and make
claim and the Drug Disposal Committee before taking a decision https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
on disposal of the vehicle, shall grant opportunity of hearing to the parties and pass appropriate

Balu P vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 20 December, 2024
orders on the representation made by the party in accordance with law, as expeditiously as possible,
within a period of two months. Further, if any persons approach the trial Court for release of vehicle,
the property already produced before the trial Court and assigned R.P.Number then such court shall
conduct enquiry and pass suitable orders, as contemplated under Section 63 of the NDPS Act or if
the vehicle not produced before the Court then competent Court shall pass appropriate order by
directing the petitioner to approach concerned Drug Disposal Committee for getting suitable relief.
Further, in the event of trial Court / Special Court for NDPS release the vehicle under Section 451
Cr.P.C., shall initiate the confiscation proceedings and dispose the vehicle as contemplated under
Section 63 of the NDPS Act.
6. Further, he relied on the order of this this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024, dated
08.02.2024 wherein this Court, following the order passed in Nahoorkani's case (cited supra) held
that whenever a return of property is filed, the petitioner has to satisfy Sections 60, 61 and 62 of
NDPS Act. In yet another case, in Crl.R.C(MD)No.1395 of 2023, Gomathi Vs. State, dated
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 27.02.2024, this Court passed orders on the similar line of
Nahoorkani's case. Further, he referred Crl.R.C.No.675 of 2023 in the case of Salimrajan @ Salimraj
Vs. State dated 12.07.2023 wherein this Court again followed the Nahoorkani's case. In sum and
substance, he argued that any property say conveyance seized in NDPS Act cases cannot be returned
as a matter of routine and it is only after satisfying Sections 60, 61, 62, and 63 of the said Act.
7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner opposed the contention of the learned State
Public Prosecutor and submitted that Mohanlal's case, refers to Section 52-A primarily with regard
to not following the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated
10.05.2007 and 16.01.2015, which prescribed procedures to be followed while conducting seizure of
contraband, sampling, safe custody and disposal finding that there is no uniform procedures
followed in seizure, sampling and storing the narcotic in safe vaults and handling and disposal of
seized narcotics, lying in the malkhanas or any other storage place without proper storage facility,
thereby, the danger of recirculation of seized contraband into system is very much likely, hence
issued directions to the Investigation Agency, Magistrate and Governments to follow guidelines.
Further, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis submitted that this Court, following the Apex Court
Judgment in Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala and Anr in Crl.A.No.2005/2022, reported in 2022 (7) KHC
2731, wherein the Apex Court released the vehicle involved in the NDPS Act well after Mohanlals'
case. Hence, it cannot be said that Mohanlal's case places restrictions on release of vehicle. The
Sainaba's case, being the Judgment of the Apex Court this Court finding, it is binding under Article
144 of the Constitution of India entertained and allowed the return of property petition filed under
Sections 451 and 457. The citations referred by the State Public Prosecutor is no more res integra on
the point of return of property. He further added that this Court in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.41 of 2019,
Crl.R.C.(MD)No.116 of 2024 and Crl.R.C.(MD)No.1395 of 2023 and in Crl.R.C.(MD)No.675 of 2022,
the Sainaba's case was not considered. In view of the Apex Court Judgment in Sainaba's case, the
confiscation proceedings cannot be an embargo to consider the return of property petition, but of
course, the return of property petition to be considered on its own merits and hence, there is no
impediment to entertain the above petition.

Balu P vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 20 December, 2024
8. I have heard the learned counsels appearing on either side and perused the materials available on
record.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
9. On perusal of the records it is seen that in Mohanlal's case, the Apex Court finding is that, despite
issuance of the Standing Order No.1/1989 and the subsequent Standing Orders, dated 10.05.2007
and 16.01.2015, no uniform practice and procedures followed by State or Central Agencies in the
matter of drawing of samples at the time of seizure, storage of drugs in safes and vaults, not placed
in double- locking system and piquant situation arose by which accumulation of huge quantities of
the seized drugs and narcotics increased and the chances of their pilferage for re-circulation in the
market, hence put in place certain procedures and guidelines to the Investigation Agency,
Magistrate, Central and State Governments, and ordered formation of Drug Disposal Committee to
monitor the same. No direction with regard to the conveyance considered and issued. Further, the
Notification No.G.S.R.899(E), dated 23.12.2022 issued in terms of Section 52-A of the NDPS Act.
The question whether there is any legal embargo in view of confiscation proceedings under Sections
60 to 63 of the NDPS Act and whether petition seeking return of property under Sections 451 and
457 can be entertained and decided has been dealt in detail by the Karnataka High Court Division
Bench in Rathnamma v. State rep., by PSI, Channagiri Police https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Station, Davabagere District in CRL.P.No.3571/2021, which was in conflict to the Division Bench
Judgement of the Kerala High Court in Shajahan Vs. Inspector of Excise and Others reported in
2019 SCC Online Ker 3685, hence the matter was referred to a Larger Bench by the Kerala High
Court and the Kerala High Court in the case of Pradeep B. Vs. The District Drug Disposal Committee
represented by its Chairman, Kasargod and Others in WA No.1304 of 2022, dated 19.02.2024 dealt
in detail, referring to Section 52-A, guidelines given in the Mohanlal's case and held that
jurisdictional Special Court under the NDPS Act has power to consider the grant of interim custody
of the vehicle under the Act by invoking powers under Section 457 of Cr.P.C., and answered the
reference accordingly. It had also referred to the orders passed by Allahabad High Court in Shams
Tavrej v. Union of India reported in 2023 SCC OnLine AII 1154 and Rajdhari Yadav v. State of U.P.
Reported in 2022 SCC OnLine AII 583 and Union of India v. Tejinder Singh reported in 2023 SCC
OnLine Gau 729 and following Sainaba Vs. State of Kerala (2022 (7) KHC 273) held interim custody
of a vehicle involved under the NDPS Act could be ordered. In Sainaba's case, the procedures
contemplated and applicable in NDPS Act in consonace with Cr.P.C., are dealt in detail.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis The Apex Court considering both NDPS Act and Cr.P.C., held as
follows:-
“5. It has been opined by the High Court that the Court is not empowered to exercise
the jurisdiction under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to release a
vehicle involved under NDPS Act in interim custody.
6.The appellant has urged inter alia that as per Section 36-C read with Section 51 of
the NDPS Act, Criminal Procedure Code would be application for proceedings by a
Special Court under NDPS Act and Section 451 has an inbuilt provision to impose any
specific condition on the appellant while releasing the vehicle. The appellant is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66851429/ 5
Balu P vs State Rep.By Inspector Of Police on 20 December, 2024
undoubtedly the registered owner of the vehicle but had not participated in the
offence as alleged by the prosecution nor had knowledge of the alleged transaction.
7. Learned counsel seeks to rely on the judgment of this Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal
Desai Vs. State of Gujarat – 2003 (2) KLT 1089 (SC) = (2002) 10 SCC 283 opining
that it is no use to keep such seized vehicles at police station for a long period and it is
open to the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders immediately by taking a bond and
a guarantee as well as security for return of the said vehicle, if required any any point
of time.
8. On hearing learned counsel for parties and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis in the
conspectus of the facts and circumstances of the case, and the legal provisions
referred aforesaid, we are of the view that this is a appropriate case for release of the
vehicle on terms and conditions to be determined by the Special Court.”
10. Hence, following the Supreme Court Judgment, in Sainaba's case, and the Full
Bench of Kerala High Court in Pradeep's case, this Court finds the objection of the
learned State Public Prosecutor that there is total embargo in entertaining the
petition for return of property under the relevant provision of Cr.P.C., is no more res
intergra. In view of the same, this Court is inclined to entertain and consider the
grant of interim custody of vehicles seized under the NDPS by invoking the power
under Sections 451 and 457 of Cr.P.C consequently under Section 497 and 503 BNSS.
11. It is seen that the petitioner is the owner of the lorry and he is running transport
business. The container containing 131 Rolls of Garments Fabrics was transported
from from Visakhapatnam to Tuticorin Port and from there to Colombo. The act of
the accused 1 and 2 in broke opened the container and concealing the Ganja, the
petitioner has no knowledge and the petitioner cannot be penalized
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis for the illegal act of the driver and another person.
The petitioner purchased the vehicle by availing loan and he is compelled to pay the
monthly EMI. The vehicle is the source of income to pay EMI and also to sustain the
petitioner. Further, if the vehicle is kept in open yard exposed to sunlight and rain,
the condition of the said vehicle will be deteriorating day-by-day and the value of the
vehicle will get diminished. In view of the same, this Court is inclined to allow the
Revision.
12. The lower Court following the guidelines given in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai case,
take photographs, record the features of the vehicle, prepare a proceeding to be used
as proof in the trial, before releasing the vehicle to the petitioner.
13. In view of the foregoing reasons, the order of dismissal dated 18.09.2024 in
Crl.M.P.No.9866 of 2024, passed by the learned Principal Special Judge under EC &
NDPS, Chennai, is set aside and this Revision is allowed with a direction to the
learned Principal Sessions Judge, to release the petitioner's vehicle viz., Goods
