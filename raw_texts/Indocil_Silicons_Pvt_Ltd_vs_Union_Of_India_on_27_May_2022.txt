ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 5
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022

Factual Matrix - W.P.No.1920/2021
3. Petitioner was granted a Prospecting License dated 14.8.2007 for iron ore and associated
minerals over an area of 1500 hectares in Sandur Taluk, Bellary District by the Government of
Karnataka, for a period of 3 years. The prospecting is to be undertaken in accordance with the
requirements of Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988 and prospecting report is
required to be submitted. In the event that on such prospecting, mineable quantity of mineral is
found in the scientific prospecting and the prospecting report is found to be in accordance with law,
the licensee has a right in law to apply for the mining lease in terms of Section 11 of the MMDR Act.
3.1 It is contended that in accordance with the Prospecting License and the MMDR Act, the
petitioner
- 10 -
undertook detailed prospecting operations in terms of Prospecting Scheme duly approved by Indian
Bureau of Mines at considerable cost to the petitioner. Based on the scientific operations undertaken
by the petitioner, the petitioner was able to establish mineable reserves of iron ore of low grade (35%
to 45%) and quartz ore in the license area. Thereafter, the prospecting report was submitted by the
petitioner to IBM in terms of the MCDR 1988, as well as to the State Government of Karnataka on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 7
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
06.10.2008.
3.2 It is further contended that on successful completion of the prospecting operations and
establishment of minerals within the license area the Petitioner submitted an Application for grant
of mining lease dated 6.10.2008 along with its detailed Prospecting Report, to the Director,
Department of Mines and Geology, Government of Karnataka. Along with such application, the
petitioner also submitted a Demand Draft of Rs. 3,500/- for the fees for the application in terms of
Rule 22(3) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.
3.3 It is contended that on 27.3.2015, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation)
Amendment Act, 2015 was enacted to amend the MMDR Act with effect
- 11 -
from 12.1.2015. As per the newly inserted Section 10A (1) of the said Act, all pending applications for
mining leases were declared to be ineligible other than the exceptions created in sub-clause 2 of
Section 10A. it is contended that the legislature being alive to the vested rights which had already
accrued to the prospecting licensees who had undertaken the entire prospecting operations at their
own cost, with a view to seek mining leases, if the availability of mineral was proved, protected their
rights to get mining leases under Section 10A(2)(b). Accordingly, the application of the Petitioner
herein for grant of mining lease was valid and saved under the aforesaid provision.
3.4 Pursuant to the said amendment, the Government of Karnataka issued a Standard Operating
Procedure vide Government Order dated 25.5.2016, to process applications for grant of mining lease
in terms of Section 10A(2)(b) of the MMDR Act. Moreover, on 27.6.2016, the Government of India
directed all State Governments to expedite the processing and disposal of concession proposals for
seeking approval of the Central Government under Section 10A(2)(b). It is further contended that
after undergoing the level-by-level scrutiny of the documents and information submitted as
prescribed
- 12 -
in the said SOP, the petitioner's proposal came to be approved by the Commissioner, Department of
Mines and Geology for grant of mining lease on 17.8.2016. Thereafter, the petitioner's proposal was
also scrutinized by the Screening Committee which had been constituted for the very purpose of
ensuring completeness of the proposal submitted by the applicant and was approved by the
Screening Committee on 19.9.2016.
3.5 It is also contended that the petitioner's proposal was duly examined by the Ministry of
Commerce and Industries of the State of Karnataka, and thereafter with the approval of Minister of
Mines, State Government of Karnataka, the same was forwarded to the Central Government on
21.7.2017. The said letter recorded that the application was eligible for grant of mining lease under
Section 10A(2)(b) of the MMDR Act, and requested the Ministry of Mines, Government of India to
accord its approval under the said provision subject to the area finally available after conducting the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 8
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
total station/ DGPS survey including all safety margins.
3.6 It is further contended that thereafter, in spite of the petitioner's proposal having been
thoroughly examined as per the SOP and by the Screening Committee
- 13 -
which consisted of senior officers of Government of India, State Government and after receiving
approval from several levels of scrutiny in terms of the SOP, the Ministry of Mines, Government of
India vide letter dated 17.10.2017, raised queries about alleged incomplete information/ documents
in the proposal. In this context, petitioner has put forth necessary pleadings as to how the
information and documents were complete in all respects.
3.7 Upon receipt of the said letter dated 17.10.2017 from the Government of India, the Director,
DMG, Karnataka sent a para-wise report to the Secretary, Department of Commerce and Industries,
State Government of Karnataka on 20.12.2017 reiterating that the queries pointed out by the Central
Government stood addressed by the State Government in its proposal dated 21.07.2017 as
forwarded earlier and called upon the Central Government to re-examine the proposal and accord
prior approval to the case being a case of seamless transfer under Section 10A(2)(b) of the MMDR
Act; thereafter, the petitioner made repeated attempts to follow up with the officers of the Ministry
of Commerce and Industries, in order to pursue its application for grant of mining lease. However,
no further action was taken in respect of the
- 14 -
report dated 20.12.2017 sent by the Director, DMG, Karnataka or the petitioner's application for
grant of mining lease, which is still pending before the authorities.
3.8 It is further contended that on 26.6.2020, the Director of the petitioner - Company herein
addressed an email to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and Industries, Government of
Karnataka highlighting the inordinate delay in processing of the petitioner's application and
requesting that the report dated 20.12.2017 be forwarded to the Ministry of Mines at the earliest. As
no response was received from the concerned officials, the petitioner once again addressed emails
dated 20.7.2020, 6.8.2020 and 17.9.2020 for the same purpose; however, there was no response to
these communications.
3.9 It is further submitted that due to continued lack of responses by the State Government, the
petitioner once again addressed a communication dated 26.10.2020 to the Secretary, Ministry of
Mines, reiterating the factual background to its application and requesting the Secretary to advise
the State Government of Karnataka to forward the report of the Director, DMG dated 20.12.2017 to
the Ministry of Mines at the earliest. It is contended that having regard to the total and complete
inaction on the part of the
- 15 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 9
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
Central and State Governments, petitioner preferred the present petition.
3.10 It is significant to state that in the petition which was filed on 25.01.2021, petitioner sought for
interim relief's which were not granted for the time being as can be seen from the order sheet dated
02.02.2021; so also, though prayers (a) and (b) were given up by the petitioner vide Affidavit dated
20.03.2021 filed by it, the said prayers were revived vide Order on I.A.No.2/2021 dated 22.03.2022.
3.11 It is also relevant to state that during the pendency of the petition, Section 10A(2)(b) of the
MMDR Act was amended vide Amendment Act No.16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 by incorporating
two provisos to the said provision. These are the provisos which are relied upon by the respondents
in order to contend that the petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in the petition.
3.12 So also, subsequent to 28.03.2021 as stated supra, the Central Government has addressed a
communication dated 12.04.2021 to the State Government to the effect that in view of the provisos
to Section 10A(2)(b) referred to supra, the petitioner would not be entitled to the proposal for grant
of mining lease, since the
- 16 -
same has lapsed by virtue of the provisos. The said communication having come into existence
subsequent to the institution of the present petition and during its pendency, the legality, validity
and correctness of the said communication dated 12.04.2021 which has been issued pursuant to the
amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) referred to supra, is also one of the issues on controversy involved
in the present petition.
Objections of the Respondents
4. The 1st respondent - Union of India has filed its counter affidavit opposing the petition and
repudiating the various contentions and claims put forth by the petitioner. It is contended that the
amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) vide Act No. 16 of 2021 is within the legislative competence of the
Central Government and since the same has not been assailed in the petition, the claim of the
petitioner is liable to be rejected. It is contended that in view of the decision of the Apex Court in the
case of Centre for Public Interest Litigation vs. Union of India1, auction is the only method of
alienation / allocation / distribution of natural resources including minerals and as such, the
amendment (2012) 3 SCC 1
- 17 -
to Section 10A(2)(b) in 2021 is inconsonance with the said decision as well as the aims and objects
of the 2015 amendment to the MMDR Act. It is further contended that as held by the Apex Court in
the case of Tamilnadu vs. Hindstone2, no one has a vested right to a mining lease and an application
for the same has to be decided and dealt with in accordance with rules in force as on the date of
disposal of the application. It is therefore contended that though the petitioner had filed an
application seeking mining lease earlier, in view of the amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) w.e.f.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 10
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
28.03.2021, the right of the petitioner, if any, to grant of a mining lease stood lapsed on account of
the proviso inserted by way of amendment and consequently, the claim of the petitioner was liable
to be rejected.
5. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 - State of Karnataka has also filed its statement of objections denying
the various claims and contentions put forth by the petitioner. It is contended that the application of
the petitioner for grant of mining lease was a pending case attracting the amendment to Section
10A(2)(b) w.e.f. 28.03.2021 and accordingly, the same has lapsed because of the amendment. It is
also AIR 1981 SC 711
- 18 -
contended that there cannot be grant of mining lease without previous approval of the Central
Government and consequently, prayers (a) and (b) are not maintainable. So also, the application
filed by the petitioner on 06.10.2008 being a pending application has lapsed by virtue of the
amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) and prayer (c) was also liable to be rejected.
5.1 The respondents - State have also contended that technical aspects involved in the present
petition, render the same as not maintainable in law before this Court. Further, the petitioner
having not questioned the Central Government communication dated 17.10.2017 for more than
three years is not entitled to any discretionary relief in the present petition. Reliance is placed on the
communication dated 15.07.2020 by the Department of Mines and Geology to the Industries and
Commerce Department in order to contend that there were many defects in the proposal of the
petitioner for grant of mining lease. So also, the details as to how the application of the petitioner
was ineligible under Section 10A(2)(b) has been narrated by the respondents - State, who contend
that since the application was not filed as per the timelines prescribed in Section 10A(2)(b)(iv), the
petitioner was not
- 19 -
entitled to grant of mining lease. It is also contended that as per the communication dated
12.04.2021 issued by the Central Government, in the light of the amendment vide Act No.16 of 2021
by inserting the provisos to Section 10A(2)(b), the application of the petitioner for grant of mining
lease which was still pending stood lapsed and the claim of the petitioner was liable to be rejected.
Petitioner's Rejoinder
6. The petitioner has filed its rejoinder to the statement of objections, interalia denying the various
contentions urged in the statement of objections / counter affidavit filed by the respondents.
Petitioner contends that so long as the State Government has accorded its satisfaction by issuing a
communication vide Annexure-J dated 21.07.2017 to the Central Government by coming to the
conclusion that the application of the petitioner for grant of mining lease was eligible under Section
10A(2)(b), the application cannot be construed or treated as a pending application / case as
contemplated under the proviso inserted by way of amendment in 2021 which was not applicable to
the petitioner or its application. It is also contended that reliance placed on the documents produced
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 11
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
by the respondents is misconceived and the decision of this
- 20 -
Court in the case of D.Ramesh vs. State of Karnataka3 relied upon by the respondents was not
applicable to the facts of the instant case.
6.1 It is further contended that upon satisfaction being arrived at by the State Government regarding
eligibility of the application of the petitioner for grant of mining lease in terms of Section 10A(2)(b),
the State Government becomes functus officio and as such, it was not open for the State
Government to oppose the claim of the petitioner. Thus, reiterating the various contentions urged in
the petition and denying the defence put forth by the respondents, petitioner has sought for allowing
the petition.
7. We have heard Sri.Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and
Sri.S.Shivakumar, learned Central Government Counsel for 1st respondent as well as
Sri.S.S.Mahendra, learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent Nos. 2 and 3.
Petitioner's contentions - W.P.No.1920/2021
8. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in the petition and referring to the
material on record, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submitted ILR 2020 KAR 1755
- 21 -
that the vested right created in favour of the petitioner by virtue of Section 10A(2)(b) having been
inserted by way of amendment in 2015 having been recognised, confirmed and affirmed to the
satisfaction of the State Government in its recommendation vide letter dated 21.07.2017 stands
unaffected and has not been impacted by the amendment of the year 2021. It is submitted that the
provisos to Section 10A(2)(b) inserted vide Act No.16 of 2021 w.e.f.28.03.2021 is not applicable to
the application / claim of the petitioner since the same was not a pending case as on the date of the
amendment which is prospective and not retrospective and retroactive in nature or operation.
8.1 It is also pointed out that the vested right that had accrued in favour of the petitioner by virtue of
Section 10A(2)(b) which had been recognised, confirmed and affirmed to the satisfaction of the
State Government in its recommendation vide letter dated 21.07.2017 had stood crystallized and
become effective and implementable in favour of the petitioner on 28.01.2021 itself when the
petitioner had filed the petition and any subsequent amendment, more so during the pendency of
the petition will have no bearing or impact on the said crystallized right, which entitled the
petitioner to grant of mining lease in
- 22 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 12
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
terms of the law that existed prior to 28.03.2021 and asserted by the petitioner as on the date of
filing the petition itself on 28.01.2021.
8.2 It is therefore submitted that since the amendment dated 28.03.2021 which has come into
existence subsequent to institution of the present petition does not apply to the application / claim
of the petitioner for grant of mining lease which has been confirmed and recognised as being eligible
by the State Government, the petitioner is entitled to grant of mining lease and the subsequent
communication dated 11.04.2021 issued during the pendency of the petition deserves to be quashed.

10. The petitioner - Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd., was granted a Prospecting License on 02.08.2007
for a period of two years and the Deed of licence was executed in favour of the petitioner on
21.08.2007. On 09.05.2008, the petitioner submitted an application for grant of mining lease in its
favour. The various events that transpired between 09.05.2008 and 12.01.2015 when the
amendment to the MMDR Act came into force have been narrated in the petition. So also, it is
contended that the petitioner was (1985) 1 SCC 591 WP Nos.10601/2019 & connected matters
(Order dated 16.08.2019) ILR 2020 KAR 1755 (2004) 1 SCC 663 (2013) 7 SCC 571 (1981) 2 SCC 205
- 26 -
eligible to obtain a mining lease in terms of Section 10A(2)(b) which came into force on 12.01.2014
and all the events including clearances, permissions, correspondence etc., that occurred subsequent
to 12.01.2015 till 16.07.2019 on which date, mining lease was sanctioned in favour of the petitioner
have also been pleaded in the petition.
10.1 It is contended that pursuant to mining lease having been sanctioned / granted in favour of the
petitioner communicated vide letter dated 25.07.2019, the State Government issued an Addendum
dated 19.08.2019, subsequent to which, petitioner paid a sum of Rs.49,79,850/- on 05.09.2019. It is
also contended that despite the aforesaid facts and circumstances and compliance made by the
petitioner, respondents are not taking any steps to execute the Mine Development and Production
Agreement as well as the mining lease in favour of the petitioner, who is before this Court by way of
the present petition.
10.2 It is significant to state that in the petition which was filed on 25.01.2021, petitioner sought for
interim relief's which were not granted for the time being as can be seen from the order sheet dated
02.02.2021; so also,
- 27 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 15
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
though prayers (a) and (b) were given up by the petitioner vide Affidavit dated 20.03.2021 filed by
the petitioner, the said prayers were revived vide Order on I.A.No.2/2021 dated 22.03.2022.
10.3 It is also relevant to state that during the pendency of the petition, Section 10A(2)(b) of the
MMDR Act was amended vide Amendment Act No.16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 by incorporating
two provisos to the said provision. These are the provisos which are relied upon by the respondents
in order to contend that the petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in the petition.
10.4 So also, subsequent to 28.03.2021 as stated supra, the Central Government has addressed a
communication dated 12.04.2021 to the State Government to the effect that in view of the provisos
to Section 10A(2)(b) referred to supra, the proposal of the petitioner would not be entitled to grant
of mining lease since the same has lapsed by virtue of the provisos. The said communication having
come into existence subsequent to institution of the present petition and during its pendency, the
legality, validity and correctness of the said communication dated 12.04.2021 which has been issued
pursuant to the amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) referred
- 28 -
to supra, is also one of the issues on controversy involved in the present petition.
11. In this petition also, both Central Government as well as State Government have filed their
statement of objections putting forth identical contentions in support of their defence.
Factual Matrix - W.P.No.5973/2021 and
12. Both these petitions are filed by M/s.Shree Cement Limited. It is contended that prospecting
licence having been granted in favour of the petitioner on 31.08.2007 and 20.11.2007 for a period of
two years, an application for grant of mining lease was filed on 09.11.2009.
12.1 The various events that transpired between 09.11.2009 and 12.01.2015 when the amendment to
the MMDR Act came into force have been narrated in the petition. So also, it is contended that the
petitioner was eligible to obtain a mining lease in terms of Section 10A(2)(b) which came into force
on 12.01.2015 and all the events including clearances, permissions, correspondence etc., that
occurred subsequent to 12.01.2015 till 16.07.2019 on which date, mining lease was sanctioned in
- 29 -
favour of the petitioner have also been pleaded in the petitions.
12.2 It is contended that pursuant to mining lease having been sanctioned / granted in favour of the
petitioner communicated vide letter dated 03.12.2019. It is also contended that despite the aforesaid
facts and circumstances and compliance made by the petitioner, respondents are not taking any
steps to execute the Mine Development and Production Agreement as well as the mining lease in
favour of the petitioner who is before this Court by way of the present petitions.

12.3 It is significant to state that in W.P.5973/2021 which was filed on 22.03.2021, during the
pendency of the petition, Section 10A(2) (b) of the MMDR Act was amended vide Amendment Act
No.16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 by incorporating two provisos to the said provision. These are the
provisos which are relied upon by the respondents in order to contend that the petitioner is not
entitled to any of the reliefs sought for in the petition.
12.4 So also, insofar as W.P.No.17402/2021 which was filed on 18.09.2021 is concerned, it is
relevant to state that on 01.06.2021, the Central Government has addressed a communication
intimating the petitioner that in view of
- 30 -
the provisos to Section 10A(2)(b) referred to supra, the proposal of the petitioner would not be
entitled to grant of mining lease since the same has lapsed by virtue of the provisos. The legality,
validity and correctness of the said communication dated 01.06.2021 which has been issued
pursuant to the amendment to Section 10A(2)(b) referred to supra, has been assailed by the very
same petitioner Shree Cement Limited in this petition.
13. In these petitions also, both Central Government as well as State Government have filed their
statement of objections putting forth identical contentions in support of their defence.
14. We have heard Sri.Udaya Holla, learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioners and
Sri.S.S.Mahendra, learned Additional Government Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 as well as
Sri.S.Shivakumar, learned Central Government Counsel for 3rd respondent. Petitioner's contentions
- W.P.No.8807/2020, W.P.No.5973/2021 and W.P.No.17402/2021
15. In addition to reiterating the various contentions urged in W.P.No.8807/2020,
W.P.No.5973/2021 and W.P.No.17402/2021 and referring to the material on
- 31 -
record, learned Senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that the vested right created in favour of
the petitioners by virtue of Section 10A(2)(b) having been inserted by way of amendment in 2015
having been recognised, confirmed and affirmed by the State Government which has passed orders
dated 16.07.2019 and 03.12.2019 respectively granting mining leases in favour of the petitioners
stand unaffected and have not been impacted by the amendment of the year 2021.
15.1 It is submitted that the provisos to Section 10A(2)(b) inserted vide Act No.16 of 2021
w.e.f.28.03.2021 is not applicable to the applications / claims of the petitioners, since the same were
not pending cases as on the date of the amendment which is prospective and not retrospective and
retroactive in nature or operation. It is also pointed out that the vested rights that had accrued in
favour of the petitioners by virtue of Section 10A(2)(b) which had been recognised, confirmed and
affirmed by the State Government who had sanctioned / granted leases in favour of the petitioners
vide orders dated 16.07.2019 and 03.12.2019 respectively stood crystallized and become effective
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 17
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
and implementable in favour of the petitioners on 27.06.2020 and 22.03.2021 itself when the
petitioners had
- 32 -
filed the petitions and any subsequent amendment more so during the pendency of the petitions,
will have no bearing or impact on the said crystallized rights which entitled the petitioners to grant
of mining leases in terms of the law that existed prior to 28.03.2021 and asserted by the petitioners
as on the date of filing the petitions.
15.2 It is submitted that the State Government which is the competent authority to grant mining
lease had already passed orders in favour of the petitioners sanctioning / granting mining leases in
their favour and the execution of a lease deeds were a mere formality and a mini serial /
administrative act which has no nexus or connection whatsoever to the amendment to Section
10A(2)(b) which is not applicable to the claim of the petitioners.
15.3 It is therefore submitted that since the amendment dated 28.03.2021 which has come into
existence subsequent to institution of the present petitions does not apply to the applications /
claims of the petitioners for execution of the mining leases in their favour which have been
confirmed and recognised as being eligible by the State Government, which has already sanctioned
the same and consequently, the petitioners are entitled to
- 33 -
obtain the lease deeds in their favour and the communication dated 01.06.2021 which is assailed in
W.P.No.17402/2021 deserves to be quashed.
In support of his contentions, learned senior counsel has placed reliance upon the following

18. Upon consideration of the rival submissions and perusal of the material on record, the following
point that arises for consideration in the present petitions;

10A(2)(b) of the Mines and Minerals
Development Act, 1957 as inserted vide

20. As stated supra, the interpretation and applicability of the provisos to Section
10A(2)(b) as amended in 2021 falls for consideration in the present petitions.
21. Before adverting to the rival contentions, the undisputed facts borne out from the
material on record in W.P.No.1920/2021 are that the petitioner had been granted a
prospecting licence and had applied for grant of mining lease in 2007 prior to
12.01.2015 when the amendment to MMDR Act took effect by incorporation of
Section 10A(2)(b); subsequently, after following the prescribed procedure, the State
Government was satisfied that the petitioner's application was eligible and qualified
for grant of mining lease under Section 10A(2)(b) and recommended to the Central
Government for approval vide letter dated 21.07.2017. Thereafter, though the Central
Government issued a letter dated 17.10.2017 raising certain queries, pursuant to
which, there was correspondence between the State government departments, no
further steps in this regard was taken by the Government and the petitioner
approached this Court by filing the present petition on 28.01.2021. It is also not in
dispute that during the pendency of the petition, Act No.16 of 2021 was enacted by
- 39 -
incorporating the provisos to Section 10A(2)(b), which is the subject matter of the present petition.
22. Insofar as W.P.No.8807/2020 filed by Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited and W.P.No.5973/2021
and W.P.No.17402/2021 filed by Shree Cements Limited are concerned, the respective petitioners
were granted prospective licences and had applied for mining leases prior to 12.01.2015. However,
in these cases, the State Government has granted / sanctioned mining leases in favour of the
petitioners vide orders dated 16.07.2019 and 03.12.2019 respectively after the Central Government
has granted its approval and the only thing that remained to be done was execution of mining lease
deeds in favour of the petitioners.
23. In our considered opinion, the said provisos to Section 10A(2)(b) incorporated vide Amendment
Act No.16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 are not applicable to the petitioners or their claim for grant of
mining leases and execution of mining lease deeds under Section 10A(2)(b) prior to amendment for
the following reasons:-
- 40 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 22
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
(i) In the case of Bhushan Power and Steel Limited vs. State of Orissa42, the Apex
Court has held that the right to obtain a mining lease by prospecting licence holders
under Section 10A(2)(b) is a vested right. In the said judgment, it was held as under:-
17. Undoubtedly, as per sub-section (1) of Section 10-A, all applications received prior
to coming into force of the Amendment Act, 2015, become ineligible. Reason for
interpreting such a provision is not far to seek. Before the passing of the Amendment
Act, 2015, it was the Central Government which had the ultimate control over the
grant of licences insofar as mining of major minerals is concerned. As per the
procedure then existing, the State Government could recommend the application
submitted by any applicant for grant of mining lease to the Central Government and
the Central Government was given the power to grant or refuse to grant the approval.
Thus, "previous approval" from the Central Government was essential for grant of
lease, without which the State Government could not enter into any such lease
agreement with the applicant. Shortcomings of this procedure were noticed by this
Court in its judgment rendered in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of
India [Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India, (2012) 3 SCC 1] (for
short "CPIL case") and also in Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference
No. 1 of 2012 [Natural Resources Allocation, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 2012,
(2012) 10 SCC 1] . In these judgments, this Court expressed that allocation of natural
resources should normally be by auction. Judgment in CPIL case [Centre for Public
Interest Litigation v. Union of India, (2012) 3 SCC 1] had a direct relevance to the
grant of mineral concessions as the Government found that it was resulting in
multipurpose litigation which was becoming counterproductive. Mining Ordinance,
2015 was (2017) 2 SCC 125
- 41 -
passed on 12-1-2015 which was ultimately replaced when Parliament enacted the Amendment Act,
2015.
18. The exhaustive Statement of Objects and Reasons reveals that the extensive amendment in the
Act were effected after extensive consultations and intensive scrutiny by the Standing Committee on
Coal and Steel, who gave their Report in May 2013. As is evident from the Statement that difficulties
were experienced because the existing Act does not permit the auctioning of mineral concessions. It
was observed that with auctioning of mineral concessions, transparency in allocation will improve;
the Government will get an increased share of the value of mineral resources; and that it will
alleviate the procedural delay, which in turn would check slowdown which adversely affected the
growth of mining sector.
19. The Amendment Act, 2015, as is evident from the objects, aims at: (i) eliminating discretion; (ii)
improving transparency in the allocation of mineral resources; (iii) simplifying procedures; (iv)
eliminating delay on administration, so as to enable expeditious and optimum development of the
mineral resources of the country; (v) obtaining for the Government an enhanced share of the value

Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
of the mineral resources; and (vi) attracting private investment and the latest technology.
20. The Amendment Act, 2015 ushered in the amendment of Sections 3, 4, 4-A, 5, 6, 13, 15, 21 and
First Schedule; substitution of new sections for Sections 8, 11 and 13; and, insertion of new Sections
8-A, 9-B, 9-C, 10-A, 10-C, 11-B, 11-C, 12-A, 15-A, 17-A, 20-A, 30-B, 30-C and Fourth Schedule.
21. These amendments brought in vogue:
(i) auction to be the sole method of allotment;
(ii) extension of tenure of existing lease from the date of their last renewal to
31-3-2030 (in the case of captive mines) and till 31-3-2020 (for the merchant miners)
or till the completion of renewal already granted, if any, or a period of 50 years from
the date of grant of such lease;
(iii) establishment of District Mineral Foundation for safeguarding interest of persons affected by
- 42 -
mining related activities; (iv) setting up of a National Mineral Exploration Trust created out of
contributions from the mining lease-holders, in order to have a dedicated fund for encouraging
exploration and investment; (v) removal of the provisions requiring "previous approval" from the
Central Government for grant of mineral concessions in case of important minerals like iron ore,
bauxite, manganese, etc. thereby making the process simpler and quicker; (vi) introduction of
stringent penal provisions to check illegal mining prescribing higher penalties up to Rs 5 lakhs per
hectare and imprisonment up to 5 years; and (vii) further empowering the State Government to set
up Special Courts for trial of offences under the Act.
22. Newly inserted provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 are to be examined and interpreted
keeping in view the aforesaid method of allocation of mineral resources through auctioning, that has
been introduced by the Amendment Act, 2015. Amended Section 11 now makes it clear that the
mining leases are to be granted by auction. It is for this reason that sub- section (1) of Section 10-A
mandates that all applications received prior to 12-1-2015 shall become ineligible. Notwithstanding,
sub-section (2) thereof carves out exceptions by saving certain categories of applications even filed
before the Amendment Act, 2015 came into operation. Three kinds of applications are saved:
22.1. First, applications received under Section 11-A of the Act. Section 11-A, under
new avatar is an exception to Section 11 which mandates grant of prospecting licence
combining lease through auction in respect of minerals, other than notified minerals.
Section 11-
A empowers the Central Government to select certain kinds of companies mentioned in the said
section, through auction by competitive bidding on such terms and conditions, as may be
prescribed, for the purpose of granting reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 24
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
in respect of any area containing coal or lignite.
Unamended provision was also of similar
- 43 -
nature except that the companies which can be selected now for this purpose under the new
provision are different from the companies which were mentioned in the old provision. It is for this
reason, if applications were received even under unamended Section 11-A, they are saved and
protected, which means that these applications can be processed under Section 11-A of the Act.
22.2. Second category of applications, which are kept eligible under the new provision, are those
where the reconnaissance, permit or prospecting licence had been granted and the permit-holder or
the licensee, as the case may be, had undertaken reconnaissance operations or prospecting
operations. The reason for protecting this class of applicants, it appears, is that such applicants, with
hope to get the licence, had altered their position by spending lot of money on reconnaissance
operations or prospecting operations. This category, therefore, respects the principle of legitimate
expectation.
22.3. Third category is that category of applicants where the Central Government had already
communicated previous approval under Section 5(1) of the Act for grant of mining lease or the State
Government had issued letter of intent to grant a mining lease before coming into force of the
Amendment Act, 2015. Here again, the raison dêtre is that certain right had accrued to these
applicants inasmuch as all the necessary procedures and formalities were complied with under the
unamended provisions and only formal lease deed remained to be executed.
22.4. It would, thus, be seen that in all the three cases, some kind of right, in law, came to be vested
in these categories of cases which led Parliament
- 44 -
to make such a provision saving those rights, and understandably so.
(ii) As held by the Apex Court in the aforesaid judgment, it is clear that the petitioner who has been
held to be eligible and qualified to obtain a mining lease as can be seen from the State Government
recommendation / report dated 21.07.2017 has a vested right to obtain a mining lease in terms of
Section 10A(2)(b). As a corollary, it follows there from that the said vested right having been created
and stood accrued in favour of the petitioner by virtue of Section 10A(2)(b) and confirmed, affirmed
and recognised by the State Government on 21.07.2017, the said vested right to obtain a mining
lease cannot be taken away or effaced or nullified by subsequent amendment by insertion of the
provisos w.e.f. 28.03.2021.
(iii) In the case of Shankar Lal Nadani vs. Sohan Lal Jain43, after reviewing the earlier law on the
issue, the Apex Court has reiterated that rights of parties stand crystallized on the date of institution
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 25
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
of the lis and therefore, the law applicable on the date of filing / institution of the lis will continue to
apply till the same is disposed of or adjudicated and change of law will not impact or affect the
vested right 2022 SCC Online SC 442
- 45 -
of a party that had accrued and stood crystallized in his favour as on the date of institution of the lis;
in this context, it is relevant to state that the right to obtain a mining lease and the right to get a
lease deed executed in favour of the respective petitioners which are vested rights stood crystallized
when the respective writ petitions were filed by the petitioners undisputedly prior to 28.03.2021
when the amendment came into force. In other words, the right to obtain a mining lease and get the
lease deed executed got crystallized much prior to the amendment which came into force on
28.03.2021 and consequently, the said vested right which stood crystallized cannot be said to have
been taken away by the amendment and on this ground also, in the peculiar and special facts and
circumstances of the instant cases, wherein the respective petitioners had exercised their right to
obtain a mining lease and lease deed which had become implementable and executable, the proviso
which came into force on 28.03.2021 neither applies nor affects or impacts the right of the
respective petitioners to grant of the reliefs sought for by them.
(iv) As rightly contended by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioners, in the context of the
proviso
- 46 -
inserted by way of amendment in 2021 and considering the scheme of the Act and Rules, the words
"provided that for the cases covered under this clause including pending cases" do not mean any
word of extension so as to include two categories of cases; needless to say that the word "lapse"
occurring in the proviso can mean only pending cases and not concluded cases and consequently,
the aforesaid words can only be said to mean and include pending cases where no vested right are
accrued in favour of the parties and not concluded cases. In this context, useful reference may be
made to decision of the Apex Court in the cases of South Gujarath Roofing Tiles Manufacturers
Association44 and Godfrey Philips India Limited vs. State of U.P.45.
(v) It is well settled that a proviso to a provision cannot control the main provision nor be
interpreted in a manner which renders the main provision nugatory or otiose as held in various
judgments including the decisions of the Apex Court in the cases of Tahsildar Singh vs. State of
U.P.46, Casio India Company Private Limited vs. State of (1976) 4 SCC 601 (2005) 2 SCC 515 AIR
1959 SC 1012
- 47 -
Haryana47 and Indoor Development Authority vs. Manohal Lal48. In this context, a valuable right
having been created in favour of the petitioners by 2015 amendment to the MMDR Act, the proviso
which was inserted on 28.03.2021 cannot be interpreted, construed or treated as taking away the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 26
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
said valuable right which had become a vested right in favour of the petitioners and confirmed and
recognised by the State Government as stated supra. Viewed from this angle also, the proviso to
Section 10A(2)(b) is not applicable to the claim of the petitioners for grant of mining leases and
execution of lease deeds.
(vi) As held by the Apex Court in the case of Giridari Lal vs. Balbir Nath Mathur49, any
interpretation / construction of a provision that would lead to anomalies, injustice or absurdity
should not be adopted and the interpretation that would advance the object of the provision should
be given effect to. In this context, it has to be stated that the proviso to Section 10A(2)(b) inserted in
2021 cannot be interpreted in such a narrow or restricted manner so as to wipe out or nullify all
cases where the lease deeds have not been executed in favour of the prospecting licence holders who
had applied for grant of (2016) 6 SCC 209 (2020) 8 SCC 12 (1986) 2 SCC 237
- 48 -
mining lease prior to 12.01.2015 which were saved by virtue of Section 10A(2)(b). The scheme of
MMDR Act as well as the aims and objects of the amendment in 2015, are a clear pointer to the fact
that the proviso inserted in 2021 will not affect cases where vested rights have been created prior to
28.03.2021 and the said proviso can apply only to the cases where no such vested rights had been
created prior to 28.03.2021. Such an interpretation will have to be given to the proviso by dividing
the cases enumerated therein into two categories viz., (i) cases which stand lapsed on account of no
vested right having accrued or created prior to 28.03.2021 (ii) cases which do not stand lapsed and
are saved on account of vested rights having accrued or created prior to 28.03.2021. Whilst the
former category stand lapsed, the latter category continued to remain eligible and their rights to
obtain a mining lease and a lease deed continued to subsist and are not affected by the proviso to
Section 10A(2((b). In the instant cases, as stated supra, vested rights had already been created in
favour of all the writ petitioners and consequently, the amendment vide amendment Act no.16 of
2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 is not applicable to the rights of the petitioners to obtain mining leases and
lease deeds and on this ground
- 49 -
also, petitioners are entitled to succeed in the instant cases.
(vii) A perusal of the statement of objects and reasons to the amendment Act No.16 of 2021 will
indicate that at 4(vi)of the same reads as under:-
"to close pending cases of non - auctioned concession holders which have not
resulted in grant of mining leases despite passage of considerable time of more than 5
years..........."
(viii) It is well settled that the statement of objects and reasons can be used as an extrinsic aid to
construction and interpretation of a statutory provision; the aforesaid statement indicates that the
intention of the legislature was to close the cases which were pending for more than five years,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 27
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
thereby indicating that it was not the intention of the legislature to close cases which were pending
for a period less than five years and such cases which were pending for a period less than five years
were not intended to be closed or lapsed on account of passage of time by inserting the proviso to
Section 10A(2)(b).
(ix) In the instant cases, undisputedly the period of five years had not expired prior to 28.03.2021
since the State Government has submitted its recommendation on 21.07.2017 and lease was
sanctioned on 2019 in favour of the respective petitioners, within the aforesaid period of
- 50 -
five years. Under these circumstances, insofar as the writ petitioners in the present petitions are
concerned, since their rights had been recognised and confirmed and vested within a period of five
years prior to 28.03.2021, in the light of the statement of objects and reasons to the amendment Act
no.16 of 2021, it cannot be said that in the peculiar facts and circumstances, the proviso which came
into force on 28.03.2021 is applicable to the petitioners and that their application stand lapsed.
Viewed from this angle also, the claim of the petitioners to grant of mining leases and execution of
lease deeds deserve to be upheld.
(x) Yet another significant factor which has to be taken into account for the purpose of upholding
the claims of the petitioners is the complete and total inaction on the part of the State Government
and Central Government to ensure that mining leases are granted in favour of the petitioners and
lease deeds being executed in their favour. Undisputedly, all the petitioners have done all necessary
acts, deeds and things for the purpose of obtaining mining leases and execution of lease deeds in
their favour and the delay in granting mining leases and executing lease deeds is not attributable to
the writ petitioners; on the other hand, the material on record clearly discloses that the delay
- 51 -
in doing so is fully and completely attributable to the respondents and in the light of the well settled
principle of law that state / executive action ought to be done within reasonable time and that the
State cannot take advantage of its own wrong / inaction / delay, the contention of the respondents
that the proviso inserted in 2021 takes away the vested rights of the petitioners cannot be
countenanced under any circumstances. Under these circumstances also, the proviso inserted w.e.f.
28.03.2021 cannot be relied upon by the respondents to contend that the petitioners are not entitled
to grant of mining lease and execution of lease deeds, particularly when the respondents themselves
are guilty and responsible of long and inordinate delay in not taking any steps in this regard till
28.03.2021. The oft quoted Maxim "Nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria" (no
man can take advantage of his own wrong) which is a primordial tenet of equity and has also been
well recognised by the Apex Court in a series of decisions is directly and squarely applicable to the
facts of the instant case, particularly when the State owes a duty to act fairly, rationally and
reasonably in all its spheres of activity and consequently, the respondents having failed in their legal
and statutory duties to take necessary steps pursuant to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 28
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
- 52 -
the State Government's approval of the year 2017 and / or the mining lease sanctioned in 2019, the
respondents are not entitled to take advantage of their own mistake / wrong and seek shelter under
the amendment of the year 2021 which is not applicable to the facts of the instant case on this
ground also.
(xi) Similarly, the Maxim, "Actus curiae neminem gravabit" (act of court should prejudice no man /
no party should suffer due to the act of court) is also applicable to the facts of the instant case; as
stated supra, the right to obtain a mining lease and to get the lease deed executed in their favour had
accrued and stood crystallized in favour of the petitioners as on the date of filing the respective writ
petitions prior to the amendment Act 16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021; viewed from this angle also,
delay on the part of the Court in enforcing, implementing and giving effect to the accrued /
crystallized rights of the petitioners cannot result in causing prejudice or detriment to the
petitioners or their rights; it is therefore clear that the amendment of the year 2021 to the MMDR
Act cannot be interpreted or construed in a manner so as to cause prejudice or detriment to the
petitioners or their rights, particularly
- 53 -
when this Court had undisputedly taken seisin of the lis between the parties prior to amendment.
(xii) The reliance placed on the decision of the Apex court by the respondents in Hindstone's case
(supra), is not correct in the light of the subsequent judgment of the Apex Court in Bhushan Steel's
case (supra), which was dealing with Section 10A(2)(b), while Hindstone's case was dealt with other
different statutory provisions under the MMDR Act and Rules and obviously, not Section 10A(2)(b)
which came into force only on 12.01.2015; so also, the other decisions relied upon by the
respondents are clearly distinguishable on facts and the same are not applicable to the facts and
circumstances obtaining in the instant writ petitions.
(xiii) Insofar as the contention urged by the respondents with regard to grant of prior approval by
the Central Government is concerned, grant / non-grant of prior approval has no nexus or
connection whatsoever with regard to interpretation of the applicability / non- applicability of the
proviso inserted in Section 10A(2)(b) by Amendment Act No.16 of 2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021; to put it
differently, for the purpose of interpretation of the said proviso to Section 10A(2)(b) which only
deals with
- 54 -
satisfaction of the State Government, the issue regarding prior approval of the Central Government
is neither germane or relevant to ascertain or adjudicate or decide the applicability of the said
proviso to the claims / applications of the petitioners and consequently, even this contention urged
by the respondents cannot be accepted.

Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
24. If seen in the light of purposive construction as well as the mischief rule, it is evident that
Parliament was wanting to eliminate discretion as well as administrative delay while enacting the
2015 amendment. The MCR, 2016 were enacted pursuant to the said 2015 Amendment and the time
period was prescribed to eliminate the administrative delay and as such non-adherence to the time
period by the statutory authority cannot be reason to make the citizens suffer as held in Society for
Promotion of Education Adventure Sport & Conservation of environment vs CIT50 coupled with the
fact that the scheme of Rule 7 whereunder once the State has taken a decision about satisfaction of
the conditions under Section 10A(2)(b), the State is rendered functus officio. The public interest if
any, is accordingly safeguarded on the State taking a decision (2017) 11 SCC 480
- 55 -
whereafter the matter cannot be allowed to be kept in a limbo.
25. We are also persuaded to take this view keeping in view the objects and reason of the 2021
Amendment Act wherein it has been noticed as under:-
"4. The Mines and Minerals {Developmen t and Regulation) Amendmen t Bill, 2021,
inter alia, provides for the following, namely :-
(i)- (v).......
(vii) to close the pending cases of non-
auctioned concession holders which have not resul ted in grant of mining leases despite passage of a
considerable time of more than five years. The existence of these cases is anachron istic and
antagonistic to the auction reg ime. The closure of the pending cases would facilitate the
government to put to auction a large number of mineral blocks in the interest of nation resulting in
early operationalization of such blocks and additional revenue to the state governments .
26. If the aforesaid objects and reasons and the amended statute is to be interpreted in the manner
being sought by the Respondents, it would result in absurdities and anomalies which are to be
avoided while interpreting statutes. Apart from the fact that it would never have been the intention
of Parliament to punish the applicants whose rights they had originally recognised and protected in
the 2015 amendment, for faults and inaction of its own
- 56 -
officers, such an interpretation inter alia would expose the amendment to challenge as being
manifestly arbitrary. As noticed above, the court should resort to an interpretation which renders
the provision constitutional and not otherwise. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the Central
Government having failed to take a decision within the statutorily prescribed period under Rule 7 of
MCR, 2016, the recommendation of the State Government was deemed to be approved for grant of
mining lease to the Petitioner and the execution of the mining lease is merely a ministerial act which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 30
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
will be done in accordance with law. Under these circumstances, the said contention of the
respondents cannot be accepted.
27. It is settled law that though legislature can always make retrospective law, however the
presumption is always that the law is to apply prospectively, unless it has expressly or impliedly
been made retrospective. The intention of the legislature has to be gathered from the language of the
provisions and external aid can also be resorted to in the form of objects and reasons of the
amendment. It is equally well settled that an interpretation
- 57 -
which would result in absurdities and anomalies should be avoided.
28. The Supreme Court in Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar51 discussed in detail the law on the effect of
amendment and retrospective applicability of such law, if any. The relevant observations are as
under:-
" 21. It was also argued that the amending Act being retrospective, whatever the right
the plaintiff possessed on the date of adjudication of the suit, the same stood
extinguished during pendency of appeal and therefore, the plaintiff's suit must fail.
Since both the arguments are overlap ping, we shall consider the effect of the decision
in Lachmeshwar Prasad Shukul v. Keshwar Lal Chaudhuri (AIR 1941 FC 5 : 1940 FCR
84) slightly later. Before that, it is necessary to consider the effect of substituted
Section 15 introduced by the amending Act of 1995 on the substantive rights of the
parties. We would now proceed to examine whether the said provision of the
amending Act is retrospective as urged by learned counsel for the appellant.
22. In Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn., the statement of law in
this regard is stated thus:
"Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than thus - 'that a
retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right
or obligation, otherwise than as regards matters of procedure, unless that effect
cannot be avoided without doing violence to the language of the enactment. If the
enactment is expressed in language which is fairly capable of either interpretation, it
ought to be construed as prospective only'. The rule has, in fact, two aspects, for it,
'involves another and subordinate rule, to the effect that a statute is not to be
construed so as to have greater retrospective operation than its language renders
necessary'."

6. In Francis Bennion's Statutory Interpretation, 2nd Edn., the statement of la w is stated as follows:
"The essential idea of a legal system is that current law should govern current
activities . Elsewhere in this work a particular Act is likened to a floodlight switched
on or off, and the general body of law to the circumambient air. Clumsy though these
images are, they show the inappropriateness of retrospective laws. If we do
something today, we feel that the law applying to it should be the law in force today,
not tomorrow's back ward adjustment of it. Such, we believe, is the nature of law.
Dislike of ex post facto law is enshrined in the United States Constitution and in the
Constitution of many American States, which forbid it. The true principle is that lex
pros picit non respicit (law looks forward not back). As Willes,J. said retrospective
legislation is 'contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct
of mankind is to be regulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal with
future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on
upon the faith of the then existing law'."
24 . In Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Chaudhry ( AIR 1957 SC 540 : 1957 SCR
488) this Court observed as thus: (A I R p. 553, para 25) "The golden rule of construction is that, in
the absence of anything in the enactment to show that it is to have retrospective operation, it cannot
be so construed as to have the ef fect of altering the law applicable to a claim in litigation at the time
when the Act was passed ."
25. In Da yawati v. lnderjit (AIR 1966 SC 1423 : (1966) 3 SCR 275) it is held thus:
(AI R p . 1426, para 10) "10. Now as a general proposition , it may be admitted that
ordinarily a court
- 59 -
of appeal cannot take into account a new law, brought into existence after the judgment appealed
from has been rendered, because the rights of the litigants in an appeal are determined under the
law in force at the date of the suit. Even before the days of Coke, whose maxim - a new law ought to
be prospective, not retrospective in its operation - is oft-quoted, courts have looked with disfavour
upon laws which take away vested rights or affect pending cases. Matters of procedure are, however,
different and the law affecting procedure is always retrospective . But it does not mean that there is
an absolute rule of inviolability of substantive rights. If the new law speaks in language, which,
expressly or by clear intendment, takes in even pending matters, the court of trial as well as the
court of appeal must have regard to an intention so expressed, and the court of appeal may give
effect to such a law even after the judgment of the court of first instance."
26. In Hitendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra [(1994) 4 SCC 602 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1087]
this Court laid down the ambit and scope of an amendin g Act and its retrospective operation as
follows: (SCC p . 633, para 26) "(i) A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 32
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
prospective in operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment,
whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is textually impossible,
is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be given an extended meaning and
should be strictly confined to its clearly-defined limits.
(ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating to right of
action and right of
- 60 -
appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.
(iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in procedural law.
(iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively where the result
would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new duties in respect of transactions
already accomplished.
(v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and liabilities shall be
construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise provided, either expressly or by necessary
implication."
27 . In K.S. Paripoornan v. State of Kerala [(1994) 5 SCC 593] (SCC at p.636) this Court while
considerin g the effect of amendment in the Land Acqui sition Act in pending proceedings held thus:
(SCC para 67) "67. In the instant case we are concerned with the ap plication of the provisions of
sub-sect ion (1-A) of Section 23 as introduced by the amending Act to acquisition proceedings which
were pending on the date of commencement of the amendin g Act.
In relation to pending proceedings, the approach of the courts in England is that the same are unaf
fected by the changes in the law so far as they relate to the determination of the substantive rights
and in the absence of a clear indication of a contrary intention in an amendin g enactment, the
substantive rights of the parties to an action fall to be determined by the law as it existed when the
action was commenced and this is so whether the law is changed before the hearin g of the case at
the first instance or while an ap peal is pending. (See Halsbury's
- 61 -
Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 44, para
922.)"
28. From the aforesaid decisions the legal position that emerges is that when a repeal
of an enactment is followed by a fresh legislation, such legislation does not af fect the
substantive rights of the parties on the date of the suit or adjudication of the suit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 33
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
unless such a legislation is retrospective and a court of ap peal cannot take into
consideration a new law broug ht into existence after the judgment ap pealed from
has been rendered because the rights of the parties in an appeal are determined
under the law in force on the date of the suit. However, the position in law would be
different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights
of parties are concerned, they remain unaf fected by the amendment in the
enactment. We are, therefore , of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an
enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such legislation is
prospective in operation and does not affect substant ive or vested rights of the
parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. We
are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation
of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective
operation than its language renders necessary, but an amending Act which af fects
the procedure is presumed to be retrospective, unless the amendin g Act provides
otherwise. We ha ve carefully looked into the new substituted Section 15 brought in
the parent Act by the Amendment Act, 1995 but do not find it either expressly or by
necessary implication retrospective in operation which may affect the rights of the
parties on the date of adjudication of the suit and the same is required to be taken
into consideration by the ap pellate court. In Shanti Devi v. Hukum Chand [(1996) 5
SCC 768] this Court had occasion to

interpret the substituted Section 15 with which we are concerned and held that on a
plain reading of Section 15, it is clear that it has been introduced prospectively and
there is no question of such section affecting in any manner the judgment and decree
passed in the suit for pre- emption affirmed by the High Court in the second ap peal.
We are respectfully in agreement with the view expressed in the said decision and
hold that the substituted Section 15 in the absence of anything in it to show that it is
retrospective, does not affect the right of the parties which accrued to them on the
date of the suit or on the date of passing of the decree by the court of first instance.
We are also of the view that the present appeals are unaf fected by change in law
insofar it related to determination of the substantive rights of the parties and the
same are required to be decided in the light of the law of pre-emption as it existed on
the date of passing of the decree."
"34. During the course of argument, a half-hearted argument was raised that a
substituted section in an Act introduced by an amending Act is to be treated having
retroactive operation. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, the function
of a substituted section in an Act is to obliterate the rights of the parties as if they
never existed . This argument is noted only to be rejected . A substituted section in an
Act is the product of an amending Act and all the effects and consequences that
follow in the case of an amending Act, the same would also follow in the case of a
substituted section in an Act.

36. Learned counsel then argued that since the amending Act being a beneficial
legislation, retrospectivity is implied in it. Assuming for the sake of argument that
right of pre-emption being a feudal or archaic law and therefore, the amending Act is
a beneficial legislation meant for the
- 63 -
general benefit of citizens but there is no such rule of construction that a beneficial
legislation is always retrospective in operation, even though such legislation either
expressly or by necessary intendment is not made retrospective. In the case of Moti
Ram v. Suraj Bhan [AIR 1960 SC 655 :
(1960) 2 SCR 896] it was held thus:
[AIR p.658, para 8] " It is clear that the amendment mad e is not in relation to any
procedure and cannot be characterized as procedural. It is in regard to a matter of
substantive law since it affects the substantive rights of the landlord. It may be
conceded that the Act is intended to provide relief to the tenants and in that sense is a
beneficial measure and as such its provision should be liberally construed; but this
principle would not be material or even relevant in deciding the question as to
whether the new provision is retrospective or not. It is well settled that where an
amendment affects vested rights the amendment would operate prospectively unless
it is expressly made retrospective or its retrospective operation follows as a matter of
necessary implication . The amending Act obviously does not make the relevant
provision retrospective in terms and we see no reason to accept the suggestion that
the retrospective operation of the relevant provision can be spelt out as a matter of
necessary implication."
29. The aforesaid principles have also been reiterated in GJ Raja vs Tejraj Surana52.
30. Similarly, in Suhas H. Pophale v. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd53, the Court has
observed as under:
(2019) 19 SCC 469 (2014) 4 SCC 657
- 64 -
"45. It has been laid d own by this Court time and again that if there are rights
created in favour of any per son, whethe r they are property rights or rights arising
from a transaction in the na ture of a contract, and particularly if they are protected
under a statute, and if they are to be taken away by any legislation, that legislation
will have to say so specifically by gi ving it a retrospective effect. This is because
prima facie every legislation is prospective (see para 7 of the Constitution Bench
judgment in Janardhan Reddy v. State [AIR 1951 SC 124 : (1951) 52 Cri LJ 391) ) . In

Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
the instant case, the ap pellant was undoubtedly protected as a "deemed tenant"
under Section 15-A of the Bomba y Rent Act, prior to the merger of the erstwhile
Insurance Company with a government company, and he could be removed only by
following the procedure available under the Bombay Rent Act. A "deemed tenant "
under the Bombay Rent Act, continued to be protected under the succeeding Act, in
view of the definition of a "tenant" under Section 7(15)(a )(ii ) of the Maharashtra
Rent Control Act, 1999. Thus, as far as the tenants of the premises which are not
covered under the Public Premises Act are concerned, those tenants who were
deemed tenants under the Bombay Rent Act continued to ha ve their protection
under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Should the coverage of their premises
under the Public Premises Act make a difference to the tenants or occupants of such
premises , and if so, from which date?
46. It has been laid down by this Court through a number of judgments rendered
over the years, that a legislation is not to be given a retrospective effect unless
specifically provided for , and not beyond the period that is provided therein. Thus, a
Constitution Bench held in Garikapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Chaudhry [AI R 1957 SC
540] that in the absence of any thing in the enactment to show that it is to be
retrospective, it cannot be so constructed, as to ha ve the effect of altering the law
applicable to a claim in litigation at the time when the Act was passed . In that ma
tter, the Court was concerned with the issue as to whether the
- 65 -
appellant's right to file an appeal continued to be available to him for filing an appeal
to the Andhra Pradesh Hig h Court after it was created from the erstwhile Madras
High Court. The Constitution Bench [AIR 1957 SC 540] held that the right very much
survived, and the vested right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent
enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary intendment and not otherwise.
47. Similarly, in Mahadeolal Kanodia v. Administrator General of W.B. [AI R 1960 SC
936] , this Court was concerned with the retrospectivity of law passed by the West
Bengal Legislature concerning the rights of tenants and in para 8 of the judgment the
Court held that: [AIR p. 939] "8.The principles that ha ve to be applied for
interpretation of statutory provisions of this nature are well established . The first of
these is that statutory provisions creating substantive rights or taking away
substantive rights are ordinaril y prospective; they are retrospective only if by express
words or by necessary implication ...."
48. In Amireddi Raja Gopala Rao v. Amireddi Sitharamamma [AI R 1965 SC 1970 : (1965) 3 SCR
122), a Constitution Bench was concerned with the issue as to whether the rights of maintenance of
illegitimate sons of a Sudra as available under the Mitakshara School of Hindu law were affected by
introduction of Sections 4, 21 and 22 of the Hindu Ado ptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The Court
held that they were not, and observed in para 7 as follows : (AIR p . 1973) " 7. ... a statute should be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 36
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested rights, [ Ed.: The words between asterisks are found
in AIR but not in SCR.] and if the words are open to another construction, such a construction
should never be adopted [Ed.:
The words between asterisks are found in AIR but not in SCR.]"
- 66 -
49. The same has been the view taken by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in /TO
v. lnduprasad Devshanker Bhatt [AIR 1969 SC 778] in the context of a provision of
the Income Tax Act, 1961, in the matter of reopening of assessment orders. In that
matter the Court was concerned with the issue as to whether the Income Tax Officer
could reopen the assessment under Sections 297(2)(d)(ii) and 148 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961, although the right to reopen was barred by that time under the earlier
Income Tax Act, 1922. This Court held that the same was impermissible and observed
in para 5 as follows: (AIR pp.781-82) " 5. ... The reason is that such a construction of
Section 297(2)(d)(ii ) would be tantamount to giving of retrospective operation to
that section which is not warranted either by the express language of the section or by
necessary implication. The principle is based on the well-known rule of interpretation
that unless the terms of the statute expressly so provide or unless there is a necessary
implication, retrospective operation should not be given to the statute so as to af fect,
alter or destroy any right already acquired or to revive any remed y already lost by
efflux of time."
49. In Arjan Singh v.
State of Punjab [AI R 1970 SC 703] this Court was concerned with the issue of d ate of application of
Section 32-KK added into the Pepsu Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1955. This Court held in
para 4 thereof as follows: (AIR p. 705) "4. It is a well-settled rule of construction that no provision in
a statute should be given retrospective effect unless the legislature by express terms or by necessary
implication has made it retrospective and that where a provision is made retrospective, care should
be taken not to extend its retrospective effect beyond what was intended."
50. In K.C. Arora v. State of Haryana [(1984) 3 SCC 281 : 1984 SCC (L&S) 520] this
- 67 -
Court was concerned with a service matter and with the issue as to whether an amendment in the
law could take away the vested rights with retrospective effect. The Court held that such an
amendment would be invalid if it is violative of the present acquired or accrued fundamental rights
of the af fected persons.
51. In K.S. Paripoornan v. State of Kerala [(1994) 5 SCC 593 : AIR 1995 SC 1012], a Constitution
Bench of this Court was concerned with the retrospective effect of Section 23(1-A) introduced in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 37
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
Land Acquisition Act. While dealing with this provision, this Court has observed as follows: [SCC pp.
634-35, para
64) "64. A statute dealing with substantive rights differs from a statute which relates to procedure or
evidence or is declaratory in nature inasmuch as while a statute dealing with substantive rights is
prima facie prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary implication made to ha ve retrospective
effect, a sta tute concerned mainly with matters of procedure or evidence or which is declaratory in
nature has to be construed as retrospective unless there is a clear indication that such was not the
intention of the legislature. A statute is regarded as retrospective if it operates on cases or facts
coming into existence before its commencement in the sense that it af fects, even if for the future
only, the character or consequences of transactions previously entered into or of other past conduct.
By virtue of the presumption ag ainst retrospective applicability of laws dealing with substantive
rights transactions are neither invalidated by reason of their failure to comply with formal
requirements subsequentl y imposed, nor open to attack under powers of avoidance subsequently
conferred. They are also not rendered valid by subsequent relaxations of the law, whether relating to
form or to substance . Similarly, provisions in which a contrary intention does not appear neither
impose new liabilities in respect of events taking place before their commencement, nor relieve
persons from liabilities then existing, and the view that existing obligations were not
- 68 -
intended to be affected has been taken in varying degrees even of provisions expressly prohibiting
proceedings. (See Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn ., Vol. 44, paras 921, 922, 925 and 926)"
52. In Gajraj Singh v. S TAT [(199 7) 1 SCC 650 : AIR 1997 SC 412], the Court was
concerned with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and repealing of some of its
provisions. In para 29 referring to Southerland on Statutory Construction (3rd Edn.)
Vol. I, the Court quoted the following observations:
(SCC p . 668) "29. ... '... Effect on vested righ ts Under common law principles of
construction and interpretation the repeal of a statute or the abrogation of a common
law principle operates to divest all the rights accruing under the repealed statute or
the abrogated common law, and to halt all proceedings not concluded prior to the
repeal. However, a right which has become vested is not dependent upon the
common law or the statute under which it was acquired for its assertion, but has an
independent existence.
Consequently, the repeal of the statute or the abrogation of the common law from which it
originated does not ef face a vested right, but it remains enforceable without regard to the repeal.
In order to become vested, the right must be a contract right, a property right, or a right arising from
a transaction in the nature of a contract which has become perfected to the degree that the
continued existence of the statute cannot further enhance its acquisition."

31. The MMDR Amendment Act 2021 has to be interpreted keeping in view the principles laid down
by the Supreme Court in Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar and Suhas H. Pophale v. Oriental Insurance
Co. Ltd.
- 69 -
According to the respondents, all cases under Section 10A(2)(b) would stand covered by the said
provision. The argument though attractive at first does not merit acceptance. To accept the said
submission would result in completely rendering Section 10A(2)(b) otiose. The said section
protected rights of a certain category of persons who would stand vested with rights to obtain the
mining concession on satisfaction being arrived at by the State Government. If the contention is
accepted then all those cases where the satisfaction of the State has been arrived at, including where
previous approval of the Central Government, where necessary, has also been given and the mining
lease has not been executed awaiting the grant of statutory permissions like mining lease,
environmental clearances, forest clearances etc, the same would also stand lapsed. This would be
contrary to the objective being sought to be achieved viz., to avoid delay. The lapsing of such rights
and auctioning the lease would not result in immediate production of minerals as even after auction
the successful bidder would have to obtain the clearances and permissions in terms of Rule 10 of the
Mineral (Auction) Rules, 2015 and considering that t he taking of
- 70 -
permissions is time consuming a period of 5 years is provided to execute the lease deed. In effect, if
all cases which would fall within Section 10A(2)(b) are to be considered to be covered by the proviso
then it would necessarily lead to another 5 years or even more taking into account the process of
auction would also take some time, before mineral production can start. This would never have been
the intention of the legislature or the effect contemplated.
32. Being conscious of the outcome that the legislature desired the term "cases covered under this
clause" was qualified by "including pending cases". The use of the word "includes" or "including"
though generally used as a means of extension, however this is not an inflexible rule and depending
on the context in which it is used, it can also refer to "means".
33. In South Gujarat Roofing Tiles Manufacturers Association and Anr. vs State of Gujarat & Anr.,54
the Supreme Court while considering explanation to entry 22 to Schedule of Minimum Wages Act
and considering the context in which it was used arrived at the findings that (1976) 4 SCC 601
- 71 -
the word "includes" had not been used as a word of extension but rather as a word of limitation and
in the sense of "means". The said conclusion was arrived at by the Court as though the entry 22 was
couched in wide terms as "employment in pottery industry" vide the explanation it was mentioned
that the entry would include manufacture of 9 articles of pottery. As such no purpose would have
been achieved by use of the term 'includes' as it is generally understood as a word of extension. It
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 39
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
would be worthwhile to produce the reasoning of the Hon'ble Court:
"3. The question turns on a true construction of the explanation to entry 22 which
says that for the pur pose of this entry potteries industry "includes" the manufacture
of the nine "articles of pottery" specified therein. Pottery in a wide sense will take in
all objects that are made from clay and hardened by fire, from crude earthen pots to
delicate porcelain. Mr Patel appearing for the respondent, State of Gujarat, contends
that the explanation indicates that potteries ind ustry in Entry 22 is intended to cover
all possible articles of pottery includin g Mang alore pattern roofing tiles. Referring to
the well-known use of the word 'include' in interpretation clauses to extend the
meaning of words and phrases occurring in the body of the statute, Mr Patel submits
that the explanation, when it says that potteries industry "includes" the nine named
objects, what is meant is that it includes not only these objects but other articles of
pottery as well. It is true that "includes" is generally used as a word of extension, but
the meaning of a word or phrase is extended when it is said to include things that
would not properly fall within its ordinary
- 72 -
connotation. We may refer to the often quoted observation of Lord Watson in
Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps [1899 AC 99, 105-106 :
79 LT 473 : 15 TLR 61] that when the word "include" is used in interpretation clauses
to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases in the statute "these words or phrases
must be construed as comprehending, not only such things as they signify accordin g
to their natural import but also those things which the interpretation clause declares
that they shall include."
Thus where "includes" has an extending force, it adds to the word or phrase a meanin g which does
not naturally belong to it. It is difficult to agree that "includes" as used in the explanation to Entry
22 has that extendin g force. The explanation says that for the pur pose of Entry 22, potteries
industry includes the manufacture of the nine "articles of pottery" specified in the explanation. If the
objects specified are also "articles of pottery", then these objects are alread y comprised in the
expression "potteries industry". It hardly makes any sense to say that potteries industry includes the
manufacture of articles of pottery, if the intention was to enlarge the meanin g of potteries industry
in any way."
"5............................. Pottery is an expression of very wide import, embracing all
objects made of clay and hardened by heat. If it had been the legislature's intention to
bring within the entry all possible articles of pottery, it was quite unnecessary to add
an explanation. ................................... It seems to us therefore that the legislature did
not intend everything that the potteries industry turns out to be covered by the entry.
What then could be the purpose of the explanation. The explanation says that, for the
pur pose of Entry 22, potteries ind ustry "includes"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 40
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
manufacture of the nine articles of pottery named therein. It seems to us that the word "includes"
has been used here in the sense of 'means'; this is the only construction that the word can bear in the
context. In that sense it is not a word of extension, but limitation; it is exhaustive of the meaning
which must be given to potteries industry
- 73 -
for the pur pose of Entry 22. The use of the word "includes" in the restrictive sense is not unknown."
34. Similarly in the present case the term "cases covered under this clause" was sufficient and wide
enough to cover all cases however the use of word "including" reflects that the legislature wished to
restrict the proviso only to "pending cases" and not all cases to avoid the anomaly it would result in,
as noticed above. The word "including" in the proviso to Section 10A(2)(b) as such is used as a
limiting word and not as an extension or expansion and is to be understood in the sense of "means" .
35. The intention of the legislature not to cover all cases covered by Section 10A(2)(b) can also be
deduced from sub-clause (d) inserted in Section 10A(2) by the very same amending Act . The said
sub-clause reads as under:
"( d) in cases where right to obtain licence or lease has lapsed under, clauses (b) and
(c), such areas shall be put up for auction as per the provisions of this Act:"
The use of the phrase "in cases where right to obtain licence or lease has lapsed .........such areas"
clearly shows that the right does not lapse in all cases covered
- 74 -
by Section 10A(2)(b) and that certain cases would be saved from the proviso. Otherwise, the
legislature would have simply stated that the "areas in cases covered by clause (b) and (c) shall be
put up for auction as per the provisions of this Act :"
36. This brings us to the next logical question as to which cases would be covered under the term
"pending cases". The answer to the said question is also in the language of Section 10A(2)(b) which
provides that a person shall have a right for obtaining the mining lease on satisfaction of the State
Government of the conditions mentioned in clause (i) to (iv). The relevant extract of the Section
reads as under :
"(b) where before the commencement of the Mines and Minerals (Development and
Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 a reconnaissance permit or prospecting license
has been granted in respect of any land for any mineral, the permit holder or the
licensee shall have a right for obtaining a prospecting license followed by a mining
lease, or a mining lease, as the case may be, in respect of that mineral in that land, if
the State Government is satisfied that the permit holder or the licensee, as the case
may be- "
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 41
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
Therefore, where the satisfaction of the State Government has been arrived at, the State is rendered
functus officio and the right stands crystallized. The proviso seems to have an effect of lapsing the
right to
- 75 -
obtain, which could only be referable to cases where the satisfaction is not yet/yet to be arrived at
and not to cases where satisfaction is already arrived at by the State Government.
37. Further the term "lapse" as used in the proviso to Section 10A(2)(b)is generally used for
reverting .of a right from a party which has failed to fulfill its obligations or conditions under which
such right was given. The said term "lapse" is also used in Section 4A(4) of the MMDR Act where
again the right lapses on failure of the lessee to start mining operations. Parliament has employed
the said term also in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and the Right to Fair Compensation and
Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 whereunder on the
failure of the statutory authority to compete the acquisition process within the statutorily prescribed
time period, the acquisition proceedings lapse. The said term is defined in Black's Law Dictionary
(8th edn, 2004) as under:-
"the termination of a right or privilege because of failure. to exercise it within some
time limit or because the contingency has occurred or not occurred"
- 76 -
38. Therefore, keeping in view the aforesaid principles and the use of specific terms, it is evident
that the legislature was desirous of applying the proviso to only a certain class of persons within
Section 10A(2)(b) viz ., those who had either till date not completed the reconnaissance or
prospecting operations despite 5 years from 2015, which was the outer limit provided by the Act
under unamended Section 7 or those whose applications were yet to be processed and the State had
not arrived at the satisfaction. Any other interpretation would do violence to the language and
intention of the legislature . It would never have been the intention of the legislature to punish a
party who had complied with the law or to allow the executive to defeat the rights of parties by
delaying performing their duties.
39. We are also persuaded to interpret the proviso as aforesaid on the well recognized principles of
effects of proviso as propounded in a recent constitutional bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Indore Development Authority v. Manoharlal55:
"192. A proviso has to be construed as a part of the clause to which it is ap pended. A
proviso is added (2020) 8 SCC 12
- 77 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/182964490/ 42
Indocil Silicons Pvt Ltd vs Union Of India on 27 May, 2022
to a principal provision to which it is attached. It does not enlarge the enactment. In case the
provision is repugnant to the enacting part, the proviso cannot prevail ............ :
194.................
R. v. Dibdin {R. v. Dibdin, 1910 P 57 (CA)], held as under : (P p . 125) "The fallacy of the proposed
method of interpretation is not far to seek. It sins against the fundamental rule of construction that
a proviso must be considered with relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. It
treats it as if it were an independent enacting clause instead of being dependent on the main
enactment. The courts ... have refused to be led astray by arguments such as those which have been
addressed to us, which depend solely on taking words absolutely in their strict literal sense,
disregarding the fundamental consideration that they are ap pearing in the proviso."
"198. In keeping with the ratio in the aforesaid decisions, this Court is of the
considered view that the proviso cannot nullify the provision of Section 24{1){b ) nor
can it set at naught the real object of the enactment, but it can further by providing
higher compensation, thus dealing with matters in Section 24 (2) ............"
40. If the legislature was desirous of revoking the said vested rights, the amendment would have
been made to the main provision or the said provision could have been omitted with retrospective
effect. Having not done so and rather having opted the legislative tool of a proviso being inserted to
the main provision, the well settled principles of the object and purpose of a proviso would come
into play. The Respondents have
- 78 -
also relied on a large number of judgments with regard to effect of a proviso, however none of the
said judgments support the view that the proviso can have the effect of nullifying the main provision
itself, as such the present judgment is not being burdened with the said judgments which have
otherwise been considered by the constitution bench in Indore Development (supra).
41. As the proviso does not take away vested ri ghts with retrospective effect, the writ petition which
has been filed by the petitioner claiming that the right under Section 10A(2)(b) of the Mines and
Minerals (Development and R egulation) Act, 1957 as already fructified and being a vested right, has
to be proceeded with based on the law as it stood then and taken to its logical conclusion.
42. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the considered opinion that the
provisos to Section 10A(2)(b) of the MMDR Act, 1957 as inserted vide Amendment Act No.16 of
2021 w.e.f. 28.03.2021 are not applicable to the applications, claims etc., of the petitioners who are
entitled to obtain mining leases and lease deeds

from the State Government without reference to the said amendment or the proviso inserted
thereby.
43. We accordingly answer the point formulated above in favour of the petitioners.
44. In the result, we pass the following:-
ORDER
(i) W.P.No.1920/2021 is allowed. The respondent No.1 as well as respondent Nos.2
