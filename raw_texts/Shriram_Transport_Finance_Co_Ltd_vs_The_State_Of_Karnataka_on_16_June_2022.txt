THE PROVISIONS OF 'KARNATAKA PROHIBITION OF CHARGING
EXORBITANT INTEREST ACT, 2004 AS BEING NOT APPLICABLE

CHAPTER III B OF THE RBI ACT. AND ETC.
THESE PETITIONS COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,
THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
COMMON ORDER
Heard Sri Jayakumar S. Patil and Sri Shashi Kiran Shetty, learned Senior Counsels along with Sri B.
Ravishankar, Sri Deviprasad Shetty, Sri Dayanand S. Patil, Sri S.R. Hegde, Sri C.K. Nandakumar, Sri
M.S. Varadarajan, Sri Jai M. Patil, Sri Shivarudrappa Shetkar, learned counsels for the petitioners,
Sri M. Vinod Kumar, learned Additional Government Advocate for respondents 1 to 6, Smt Rashmi
Subramanya, learned counsel for the 7th respondent. Perused the writ petitions papers.
2. It is submitted that in all these writ petitions, petitioners/Non-Banking Financial Companies (for
short 'the NBFCs') registered under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, (for short 'the RBI Act')
and regulated by RBI are before this Court praying for a declaration to declare that the State
Enactments i.e., the Karnataka Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2004 (for short 'the
2004 Act'), and the Karnataka Money- Lenders Act, 1961 (for short 'the 1961 Act'), are not applicable
to the petitioners and also to quash the consequential orders.

Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 June, 2022
3. Learned Senior Counsels Sri.Jayakumar S. Patil and Sri. Shashi Kiran Shetty on behalf of the
petitioners contend that both the State enactments under challenge in these petitions are against the
legislative competence of the State Government. Since the petitioners' NBFCs are registered and
functioning under the RBI Act, falls under the ambit of 1956 Act. Further, it is submitted that
Reserve Bank of India is the regulatory body for the petitioners' NBFCs and the State Acts such as
Karnataka Money-Lenders Act, 1961 and Karnataka Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act,
2004 are State enactments under Entry 30 of List-II of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India, are
not applicable to petitioners. The petitioners are covered by the 1956 Act enacted by the Parliament
under Entry 43 of List-I of Schedule VII. Provisions of 1956 Act has made it clear that it would have
overriding effect in respect of any inconsistencies therewith contained in any other law.
4. Learned Senior Counsel would submit that the question of law raised in these writ petitions were
the subject matter of Civil Appeal No.5233/2012 [Nedumpilli Finance Company Limited V/s. State
of Kerala and Others] before the Hon'ble Apex Court. The Hon'ble Apex Court was examining the
question as to whether Non-Banking Financial Companies regulated by Reserve Bank of India in
terms of the provisions of Chapter III-B of RBI Act, can also be regulated by the State Governments
such as Kerala Money Lenders Act, 1958 and Gujarat Money Lenders Act, 2011. While answering the
said question, the Hon'ble Apex Court has made it clear that the State Enactments would have no
application to NBFCs, which are registered under the 1934 Act. It is further submitted that both the
above State Acts, which are under challenge are enacted by the State Government in exercise of their
powers under Entry 30 of List-II of Schedule VII of Constitution of India. It is submitted that State
has no power to regulate the functions of NBFCs which are registered under the Reserve Bank of
India Act. Therefore, they pray to declare both the Acts under challenge as not applicable to the
petitioners' NBFCs.
5. On hearing the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners as well as learned counsel for the
respondents, I am of the view, that question raised in the present writ petitions is covered by the
principles and decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the above stated C.A.No.5233/2012. As stated
above, the question before the Hon'ble Apex Court was whether NBFCs regulated by the Reserve
Bank of India can also be regulated by State enactments. While answering the above said question,
the Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraphs 6.11, 8, 8.4 and 11, has held as follows:
"6.11 The above scheme of Chapter III-B of the RBI Act shows that the power of intervention
available for the RBI over NBFCs, is from the cradle to the grave. In other words, no NBFC can carry
on business without being registered under the Act and a NBFC which takes birth with the
registration under the Act is liable to be wound up at the instance of the RBI. The entire life of a
NBFC from the womb to the tomb is also regulated and monitored by RBI.
8. As indicated by the Constitution Bench in Deep Chand (supra), a law may be valid when made,
but a shadow may be cast on it by supervening constitutional inconsistency or supervening existing
statutory inconsistency. Assuming that the Kerala Act was valid in its application to NBFCs when it
was made, on the ground that the business of money lending is traceable to Entry 30 of List II, it has
to give way for the parliamentary enactment. The moment the Parliament stepped in to codify the
law relating to registration and regulation of NBFCs, by inserting certain provisions in Chapter III-B
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41181031/ 14
Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd vs The State Of Karnataka on 16 June, 2022
of the RBI Act, the same would cast a shadow on the applicability (even assuming it is applicable) of
the provisions of the Kerala Act to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI.
8.4 In UCO Bank and Another vs. Dipak Debbarma and Others8, a sale Notification issued under
the Securitisation Act was challenged on the ground that it constituted an infraction of Tripura Land
Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960. This Court found that the Securitisation Act is traceable to
Entry-45 of List-I and the Tripura Act is traceable to Entries 18 and 45 of the State List. After
referring to the Constitution Bench decision in State of West Bengal and Others vs. Committee for
Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal and Others9 and other decisions, this Court held that
the Securitisation Act, being a Parliamentary legislation is the dominant legislation. To come to the
said conclusion, this Court referred to the non-obstante clause in Article 246(1).
11 In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the Kerala Act and Gujarat Act will
have no application to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI. Therefore, all the
appeals filed by NBFCs against the judgment of the Kerala High Court are allowed. Likewise the
appeals filed by the State of Gujarat against the judgment of the Gujarat High Court are dismissed."
6. Following the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court in NEDUMPILLI FINANCE COMPANY
LIMITED (supra), writ petitions are allowed and it is declared that State Enactments i.e., Karnataka
Money-Lenders Act, 1961 and the Karnataka Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2004,
are not applicable to the petitioners/NBFCs registered under the 1934 Act and regulated by Reserve
Bank of India. Accordingly,
