with 8(b) of ND&PS Act for possession of 2 packet of opium weighing 2(two) kgs. Special Secretary

Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (PIT-ND&PS Act),
1988 for preventing him from involvement in illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic

illegal activities. Grounds of detention was furnished vide letter dated 16.09.2022 by the Special

17.09.2022. Vide order dated 07.12.2022, Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur,
issued confirmation order confirming the detention order dated 13.09.2023 and fixed the period of
detention for a period of 12(twelve) months from the date of detention. Thereafter, the detenu

Central Jail, Sajiwa to (i) the Chief Secretary, Government of Manipur and (ii) the Deputy Secretary
(PIT- ND&PS), Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, New Delhi, for revoking his detention
order. Vide order dated 19.04.2023, the Commissioner(Home), Government of Manipur, rejected
the representation submitted by the detenu being devoid of merit. Vide memorandum dated
16.05.2023, the Central Government rejected the representation submitted by the detenu.

the ground that representation dated 12.04.2023 submitted by the detenu was disposed of only on
16.05.2023 by the Central Government after a lapse of more than 1(one) months and prayed that
detention order be set-aside on the ground of delay in disposal.

Shri Thanreigam Awungshi vs The State Of Manipur Represented By ... on 11 September, 2023
13.04.2023 and para wise comment was received on 18.04.2023 from the Superintendent of Police,
Imphal East and representation was disposed of on 19.04.2023. Learned Dy. G.A. submits that there
is no delay on the part of the State Government and prays that the writ petition be rejected.
[5] During the course of hearing, Mr. W. Darakeshwar, learned Sr. PCCG, appearing for the Central
Government, submitted counter affidavit on behalf of the respondent No. 4. It is stated that
representation dated 12.04.2023 submitted by the detenu was received by the Ministry from the
State Government vide e-mail on 17.04.2023 and para wise comment was received by e-mail dated
21.04.2023. Matter was put up to the Competent Authority i.e., Secretary (Revenue), Government of
India who rejected the representation submitted by the detenu vide memorandum dated
16.05.2023. It is submitted that there is no delay on the part of the Central Government and the
time taken in dealing with the representation is done as per normal official procedure.
[6] We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties, perused the materials on record
and the submissions made by the parties at bar. On perusal of the record, it is seen that the
representation dated 12.04.2023 was submitted much after the confirmation order and para-wise
comment was received from SP, Imphal East on 18.04.2023 and vide order dated 19.04.2023, the
State Government rejected the representation submitted by the detenu. This Court is of the view
that there is no lapse on the part of the State Government in connection with the present case.
However, after the received of the para-wise comment from the State Government vide e-mail dated
21.04.2023, the Secretary (Revenue), Government of India, rejected the representation submitted
by the detenu vide memorandum dated 16.05.2023. However, Central Government could not
explain the effective time of 25(twenty five) days taken after receipt of the para-wise comment from
the State Government in disposing the representation submitted by the detenu. It is settled
proposition of law as per Rajammal vs. State of Tamil Nadu reported as 1999 (1) SCC 417 and
Sarabjeet Singh Mokha Vs. the District Magistrate, Jabalpur reported as MANU/SC/1011/2021, that
unexplained delay in disposal of the representation vitiates the detention order. If the authority
concerned is not able to explain the time taken in disposal of the representation, the same will
render detention order void. In the case in hand, the Central Government has not given any
explanation for the 25 days taking in disposal of the representation submitted by the detenu even
after receipt of the para-wise comment. Accordingly, we are of the view that detention order is
vitiated and accordingly detention order dated 13.09.2022 and confirmation order dated 07.12.2022
issued by the Special Secretary(Home), Government of Manipur are set-aside and detenu Shri
Thanreigam Awungshi be released from detention forthwith, if not required in any other case.
[7] Send a copy of this order to the Commissioner (Home), Government of Manipur; and
Superintendent, Manipur Central Jail Sajiwa for information and doing needful.
[8] With these observations, the writ petition is allowed.
[9] No costs.
