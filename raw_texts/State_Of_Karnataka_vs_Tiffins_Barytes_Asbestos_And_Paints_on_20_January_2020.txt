THIS WRIT PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND
227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO SET ASIDE
THE ORDER DATED 3RD MAY 2019 IN M.A.NO.632/2018 IN
CP/39/2018 OF THE NATIONAL COMPANY LAW TRIBUNAL,
CHENNAI AS BEING ONE WITHOUT JURISDICTION AND
ATTENDED BY FRAUD VIDE ANNEXURE-A AND ETC.
THIS WRIT PETITION COMING ON FOR DISPOSAL THIS
DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING:
5
ORDER
Heard the learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the Petitioners and the learned
Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent. The first Petitioner is the State of Karnataka and
the other two Petitioners are the officers of the State Government.
2. The following order was passed by the State of Karnataka on 26th September 2018:
"The proposal of deemed extension of ML No.2293 of M/s. Tiffin's Barytes Asbestos
and Paints Limited, is rejected."
3. Tiffin's Barytes Asbestos and Paints Limited is the first respondent herein. What is challenged in
this petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is the order of the National Company Law
Tribunal (for short 'NCLT') dated 3rd May 2019 (Annexure-A). The petitioners are aggrieved by the
directions contained in paragraph 31 of the order which reads thus:
"31. In the light of the observations made above, the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are
directed to execute Supplement Deeds in favour of the Corporate Debtor/Applicant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/33584244/ 4
State Of Karnataka vs Tiffins Barytes Asbestos And Paints ... on 20 January, 2020
extending the period of the Mining Lease bearing ML No.2293 up to 31.03.2020, in
accordance with Sec. 8 A (6) of the M.M.D.R Act, 1957 as amended under the Mines
and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, within a period
of two weeks from the date of the receipt of the certified copy of this Order."
(underline supplied) The petitioners are also aggrieved by the finding recorded in paragraph 26 of
the said order (Annexure-A) which holds that the order dated 26th September 2018 is null and void
and stands set aside.
4. By the order dated 12th August 2018, Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was
initiated against the first respondent (Corporate Debtor) and Interim Resolution Professional (IRP)
was appointed. The impugned order has been passed on the application made by Resolution
Professional before NCLT wherein, he claimed a declaration that the order dated 26th September
2018 is null and void.
5. When this petition came up for consideration on 12th September 2019, this Court stayed the
operation of the direction contained in paragraph 31 of the impugned order. Being aggrieved by the
said order, the first respondent and others filed Civil Appeal Nos.9170, 9171, 9172 of 2019 before the
Apex Court. By the judgment and order dated 3rd December 2019, the said appeals have dismissed.
Our attention is invited to paragraph 45 of the said judgment and order whereby, the Apex Court
has answered the first question formulated by it. Paragraph 45 reads thus:
"45. Therefore, in fine, our answer to the first question would be that NCLT did not
have jurisdiction to entertain an application against the Government of Karnataka for
a direction to execute Supplemental Lease Deeds for the extension of the mining
lease. Since NCLT chose to exercise a jurisdiction not vested in it in law, the High
Court of Karnataka was justified in entertaining the writ petition, on the basis that
NCLT was coram non judice."
(underline supplied)
6. The conclusion drawn by the Apex Court is in paragraph 52 of the said judgment and order which
reads thus:
"52. The upshot of the above discussion is that though NCLT and NCLAT would have
jurisdiction to enquire into questions of fraud, they would not have jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon disputes such as those arising under MMDR Act, 1957 and the rules
issued thereunder, especially when the disputes revolve around decisions of statutory
or quasi-judicial authorities, which can be corrected only by way of judicial review of
administrative action. Hence, the High Court was justified in entertaining the writ
petition and we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court.
Therefore, the appeals are dismissed. There will be no order as to costs."

7. In view of the binding judgment and order dated 3rd December 2019 of the Apex Court, the
finding recorded by NCLT in paragraph 26 of the impugned judgment and order that the order
dated 26th September 2018 passed by the petitioners is null and void and stands set aside, cannot
be sustained and the said finding will have to be set aside. In view of the findings rendered by the
Apex Court which we have reproduced above, the direction issued by NCLT under the impugned
order will have to be held as illegal and the impugned order will have to be set aside.
8. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent states that in view of the above
decision and as a result of setting aside the impugned order, the order dated 26th September 2018
will stand revived and therefore, the remedy of the first respondent to challenge the said order be
kept open.
9. In view of the findings recorded by the Apex Court and in view of what we have held above, the
order dated 26th September 2018 (Annexure-B) will stand revived. However, we make it clear that
the first respondent can always challenge the said order by taking recourse to the remedies which
are available in law.
10. Accordingly, we pass the following order:
(i) The impugned judgment and order dated 3rd May 2019 passed by NCLT
(Annexure-A) on Misc.
Application No.632/2018 is hereby quashed and set aside and Misc. Application No.632/2018
stands dismissed accordingly;
(ii) As a result of the aforesaid order, the Government order dated 26th September 2018 stands
revived. As observed earlier, it will be open for the first respondent to challenge the said order by
taking recourse to the remedies available in law;
(iii) The writ petition is allowed on above terms.
