ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 03-04-2019 Heard Shri P.K. Verma, learned
Additional Advocate General for the State of Bihar and Shri Ashish Giri for the
respondent-petitioner.
2. On the basis of a complaint which arose out of a vigilance case alleging the demand and
acceptance of a bribe for appointment as an Anganwari Sevika, the respondent-petitioner, Patna
High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018 dt.03-04-2019 who was the Child Development Officer, came to
be dismissed from service on 10th December, 2014 after holding an enquiry. The same was assailed
before the learned single Judge in the writ petition giving rise to this appeal. The learned single
Judge after having traversed the fact came to the conclusion that the charge could not be proved on

The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Phulpari Kumari on 3 April, 2019
the basis of preponderance of probabilities inasmuch as no evidence was brought forth to establish
the demand of a bribe and its acceptance was also not proved except by the oral testimony of two
members of the trap team who had actually not seen the respondent-petitioner taking the bribe.
However, the criminal case is still pending and Shri P.K. Verma has informed the Court today on the
basis of the queries made on the previous occasion that a Forensic Science report from the FSL,
Bihar, Patna has been tendered before the Court on 15th July, 2016. A photostat copy of the same
has been produced before the Court.
3. The State of Bihar has come up assailing the judgment of the learned single Judge whereby the
writ petition has been allowed and she has been directed to be restored with all consequential
benefits. The appeal was entertained and vide order dated 26th June, 2018, the impugned judgment
was kept in Patna High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018 dt.03-04-2019 abeyance. It is after exchange of
affidavits that the matter has come up before us.
4. The defence set up by the respondent-petitioner in the proceeding was that the selections on the
post of Anganwari Workers were held on 24th June, 2013 and the alleged complaint was made two
months thereafter on 12th August, 2013 for which there was no occasion. In her reply during the
enquiry, the respondent-petitioner categorically stated that even though the complainant's wife had
not been selected or shortlisted, yet the complainant was pestering her to show undue favour and
when she refused to accept his request, this false trap case was set up in order to harass the
respondent-petitioner. This reply was categorically made and further procedural violations were
alleged, some of which are admitted on record. The first is that the complainant whose wife is
alleged to have been an aspirant for the post of Anganwari Worker and who had moved the
complaint in writing was never produced. The second is that the wife of complainant was also not
produced during the enquiry proceedings. Thus, the genesis of the complaint which was made the
basis for proceeding with the enquiry was not established by any evidence oral or otherwise as
neither the complainant nor his Patna High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018 dt.03-04-2019 wife, who
were aggrieved, were produced during the disciplinary proceedings to support the complaint.
5. The evidence adduced was oral testimony and two of the said witnesses on behalf of the
Department, namely, Inspector Sudesh Yadav and Constable Rasid Imam deposed that they saw the
charged officer keeping money on the chair when the raid was conducted. There was therefore no
witness or evidence relating to the alleged demand for the purpose as alleged in the complaint. In
this respect, Shri P.K. Verma relying on Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
submitted that there is a presumption about the demand having been made and consequently, it was
for the delinquent respondent-petitioner who had to disprove the fact of the demand being made.
6. Apart from the aforesaid glaring flaw in not producing the prime witnesses, namely, the
complainant or his wife, there also appears to be no force in the argument on the strength of Section
20 of the 1988 Act inasmuch as the presumption of demand by way of burden on the delinquent
would arise only after the demand has been proved as has been held by the Apex Court in the case of
State through Central Bureau of Investigation vs. Dr. Anup Kumar Srivastava, reported in AIR 2017
SC 3698- paragraph 22), wherein it has been ruled that the Patna High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018
dt.03-04-2019 proof of demand is an indispensable essentiality for permeating the mandate for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131717780/ 2
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Phulpari Kumari on 3 April, 2019
presumption as contained in Section 20 of 1988 Act. Applying the aforesaid principle, we find that
even though the two witnesses have alleged that the officer was seen keeping the money on chair in
a veranda of the house, there is no indication of any evidence of any demand having been made of
which the best witnesses, namely, the complainant and his wife, were never produced.
7. Shri Verma then alleged that the entire evidence in the criminal case, including the FSL report
demonstrates that as soon as the raiding party entered and made the recovery of the amount, the
fingers of the respondent-petitioner were emerged in the solution that had turned out to be positive.
The witnesses who saw this happening have been produced during the enquiry and therefore it
should be taken to be sufficient proof and with a high degree of probability of the incident having
occurred ,namely, that of acceptance of bribe by the respondent-petitioner.
8. This argument may or may not be accepted during the criminal trial depending upon the
correctness of the veracity of the strict measures of evidence which is required in this respect, but
the argument on behalf of the respondent-petitioner to the effect that she was virtually being
trapped in a fake case has been Patna High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018 dt.03-04-2019 dealt with by
the learned single Judge in the impugned judgment as follows:
"Mr. Sinha did make a very brilliant attempt to establish the charge but except taking
this Court through the evidence of the raiding party, who at best are witness to the
petitioner putting the money on the chair but are not the witness on alleged demand
made by the petitioner, no tangible evidence on demand could be shown.
A public servant faces high risk of being entrapped in false cases and when I observe
thus I am conscious of the genuine offenders drawn in the net. But then there are
cases of dissatisfied and disgruntled people with malicious intent to frame public
servants in false cases, not being satisfied by their decisions.
Instances of trap cases of accused
receiving illegal gratification openly without
camouflage are class apart from those where it is packed in envelop or is camouflaged
otherwise. The reason is that public servant cannot refuse to receive any document/
envelop handed over to him/her and it is only when he/ she opens the envelop
containing the alleged document that the truth is unveiled but by that time it is too
late because the Vigilance waiting at the wings pounces and dips his/ her hand in the
solution ready for the purpose and obviously since the public servant on duty has
touched the document, the solution turns pink. There thus can be possible situations
where an unsuspecting public servant is drawn in a net schemingly."
9. Shri Verma contends that such a conclusion would not be in conformity with law inasmuch as the
corroborating Patna High Court L.P.A No.370 of 2018 dt.03-04-2019 witnesses who saw the
incident were examined and their testimony was sufficient to establish her probability. We are
unable to accept this submission inasmuch as in such matters the probabilities of the defence of
false implication cannot be ruled out.

10. Consequently, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment without prejudice to
the trial which is being conducted in this regard or without prejudice to any further action which
may be required after the criminal trial concludes in accordance with law.
11. Dismissed.
