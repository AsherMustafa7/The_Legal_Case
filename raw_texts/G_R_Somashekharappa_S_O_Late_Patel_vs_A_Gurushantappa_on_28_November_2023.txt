6. The case of the plaintiff is that Patel Rudrappa was the common propositus and he had two wives
namely Shanthamma and Kallamma. From the marriage of Patel Rudrappa and Shanthamma, seven
children were born.
From the marriage of Patel Rudrappa and Kallamma, eight children were born, as is referred to in
the family pedigree supra.
- 13 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
7. Patel Rudrappa said to have died in the year 1968 and item Nos.1 to 5 of the plaint schedule
property were possessed by Patel Rudrappa as ancestral property.
It is also contended that Patel Rudrappa possessed good number of movable properties and
immovable properties at Halur Village, Channagiri Taluk. After the death of Patel Rudrappa, the
sons of Rudrappa were enjoying the joint family properties jointly. According to the plaint
averments, in the year 1972, eldest son of Patel Rudrappa by name Kallappa represented his mother,
brothers and sisters on one side and Gurushantappa, one of the sons of Patel Rudrappa and
Kallamma, represented Kallamma and his brothers and sisters, effected a division in the family on
30.08.1972.
8. The said partition was also a registered partition and thereafter, as per the division carried out in
the registered partition, the respective parties got mutated the revenue entries and started enjoying
the suit properties as of their own. On account of the effective and proper
- 14 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 management of the family properties by the 1st plaintiff as kartha of the joint
family, 1st plaintiff was able to get the good income from the agricultural land which was fallen to
the share of children of Patel Rudrappa from Kallamma, other suit properties were purchased. It is
further contended that therefore all the suit properties are the joint family properties of the
plaintiffs and defendants.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 11
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
9. When the plaintiffs demanded their share in the suit property, it was flatly refused stating that
further division of the properties have taken place in the year 1981, 1988, 1989 and 1993. It is also
contended by the plaintiffs that based on the concocted documents in collusion with the revenue
authorities, defendants managed to get the katha of the properties changed to their names. Having
noticed the mutation of the revenue entries, the plaintiffs filed a Revision Petition before the Deputy
Commissioner, Davanagere and thereafter, they were constrained to file a suit for partition, seeking
their 1/5th share in the suit property.
- 15 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
10. Upon the service of suit summons, defendant Nos.1 to 3 filed written statement and additional
written statement contending that plaint allegations are false and sought for dismissal of the suit.
They did not dispute the relationship among the parties. However, they contended that
Gurushantappa being the eldest son of Kallamma and Kallappa being the eldest son of Shanthamma
were not authorized to enter into any partition on behalf of other children and therefore, they
denied the partition deed which is said to have taken place. They also contended that at no point of
time, the plaintiffs asserted about the partition said to have taken place in 1972 and all the six
brothers are litigating with regard to the title to the property before the revenue Courts. The case
before the Deputy Commissioner, it has been held against the plaintiffs and documents are standing
in the name of respective sharers in conformity with the partition that took place in the year 1988,
1989 and 1993.
- 16 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
11. These defendants also disputed that the suit properties are the joint family properties and they
claimed that the properties which are standing in the name of the defendants are individual
properties and sought for dismissal of the suit.
12. Based on the rival contention of the parties, the learned trial Judge framed the following issues
and additional issues:
"1) Whether the plaintiffs and defendants are members of joint family and the
schedule properties are their joint family properties by virtue of family partition
dated 30.08.1972 and also subsequent acquisition out of joint family income?
2) Whether the defendants prove that the partition dated 30.08.1972 is not acted
upon and in fact the family partition was effected in the manner stated in para 4 and
5 of the written statement?

para 7 of the written statement are the self acquired properties of defendant No.2 and 3?
5) Whether the defendants prove that the house and flour mill stated in para 6 are the self acquired
properties of defendant No.1 as stated in para 7 of written statement?
6) Whether the movable and immovable properties stated in para 11 of the written statement are
required to be included in the plaint schedule?
7) Whether the plaintiffs prove that the defendants are trying to alienate schedule properties?
8) Whether the suit is barred by limitation?
9) Whether the suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?
10) Whether the valuation of the suit for court fee is not correct?
- 18 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
11) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for partition and separate possession of their 1/5th share?
12) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the relief of mesne profits and account?
13) Whether the plaintiffs are entitled for the relief of permanent injunction?
14) What decree or order?
ADDITIONAL ISSUES:
Whether the plaintiffs prove that schedule item No.15 to 19 are also joint family
properties?"

15. On conclusion of recording of the evidence, learned Trial Judge heard the parties in detail and
decreed the suit of the plaintiffs as under:
"The suit of the plaintiffs is partly decreed with cost.
The plaintiffs are entitled for partition and separate possession of 1/6th + 1/48th
share each by metes and bounds with separate possession in item No.1 to 14 of the
suit schedule properties. Item No.15 to 19 shall be allotted with respect to their share
as per the allotment.
- 22 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 So also defendant No.1 to 3 and defendant No.4 to 6 are
entitled 1/48th share in item No.1 to 14 of suit schedule property. The defendants and
their supporters are restrained from alienating the suit schedule properties.
Draw preliminary decree accordingly."
16. Being aggrieved by the same, defendant Nos.1 to 3 have preferred the present appeal on the
following grounds:
(cid:128) That, the court below without considering the documents produced has decreed the
suit of the plaintiffs, which is illegal, arbitrary and contrary to the facts of the case.
(cid:128) That, the court below has not considered and also has not marked the partition
deeds produced by the defendants contending that they are not registered document.
But, in fact, they are the corroborative evidence to prove the partition and separate
possession and also this unregistered deed is executed and signed by all the plaintiffs
and defendants without any dispute.
(cid:128) That, the plaintiff No.1 who contends that he being the son of 2nd wife of Late Patel
Rudrappa and another person, who is the elder son of the 1st wife had entered into a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 15
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
partition agreement on 30-8-1972 which is a registered
- 23 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 document. This fact was not at all pointed by anybody else in
the later partitions. Also the court below without examining him as witness has
wrongly decreed the suit filed by the plaintiffs. The court below has wrongly decreed
the suit of the plaintiffs without examining the plaintiff No.1 who has not at all
entered the witness box.
(cid:128) That, the plaintiff who seeks for partition has not included CTS No. 9345, Trailor
No. 9346 and CTS No. 7342, Trailor No 7343 and also survey No. 10 measuring 1 acre
in Kashipura village. These properties have not been included in the partition which
has not been properly analysed by the court below.
(cid:128) That, the plaintiff No.2 has accepted in his evidence that they have not given any
Power of Attorney to the plaintiff No. 1 to get the partition between the first son of the
first wife and plaintiff No.1 and also at the time of partition on 30-8-1972 all the
appellants and respondents were major as they are all not made parties to the said
partition deed. That partition even though it is a registered deed, it is not binding on
the plaintiffs and defendants and also as such after that partition it was not effected
Only the partition which was made in the year 1981 was effected and in 1988 it was
reduced in the form of writing and which was signed by all without objection and
after that all of them enjoyed the properties separately having possession and this has
not been considered by the court below.
(cid:128) That, as already stated, there is a partition in the year 1981 and 1988 between the
legal
- 24 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 heirs of first wife and second wife and thereafter in the year
1991 there was a partition among the plaintiffs and defendants and so the question of
making again the partition does not arise.
(cid:128) That, the court below has not considered properly the documentary evidence
produced by the defendants like RTC, mutation entry etc., which have been entered
separately as per the time changed and in the name of different persons. Having
admitted this point, the court below has come to the conclusion that though the
enjoyment of property is separate, they are still entitled for partition, which makes it
clear that again there must be a partition, even though already there is a partition.
That, the plaintiffs have even contested before all the revenue authorities where they
have lost their case.

20. Sri.Sumanth Kumar S. Patil, learned counsel for the appellants reiterating the
grounds urged in the appeal memorandum contended that learned Trail Judge has
not properly appreciated the material evidence on record and has blindly believed the
case propounded on behalf of the plaintiffs in holding that suit properties are the
joint family properties and wrongly decreed the suit resulting in miscarriage of
justice and thus, sought for allowing the appeal.
- 25 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
21. He further pointed out that when there was a serious dispute said to have been taken place in the
year 1972, as all the sharers were not parties to the registered partition deed, the findings recorded
by learned Trial Judge on issue No.1 thus is perse incorrect. Therefore, the appeal needs to be
allowed by holding that there was no partition in the year 1972, whereby, suit should have been
dismissed for absence of non-impleading the children of Shantamma, who was the first wife and
children born to Patel Rudrappa.
22. He further contended that if there was to be a partition in the year 1972, there could not have
been further partition in the subsequent years. According to defendants, partition of the suit
properties that is fallen to the children of Patel Rudrappa through second wife -
Kallamma has taken place first time in the year 1981 and subsequently, in the year 1981, 1988, 1989
and 1993 and at every partition, it is the plaintiffs who were dissatisfied with the awarding of the
shares and gone on seeking
- 26 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 further share in the properties resulting in defendants yielding to illegal
demands only with an intention to buy peace. Being not satisfied in granting major shares to them,
plaintiff has filed vexatious suit before the trial Court by contending false and factual aspects, which
are not properly appreciated by learned Trial Judge and decreed the suit of the plaintiffs resulting in
total miscarriage of justice and sought for allowing the appeal.
23. In support of his arguments, learned counsel for appellants has filed a memo with list of
authorities.
The relevant portion of the judgment relied on behalf of the appellants reads as under:
(1) In AIR 1995 SC 1728 (Digambar Adhar Patil Vs. Devram Giridhar Patil (died) and
another, it is held as under:
"5. We find no force in the contention. Section 32- B clearly postulates that the land
held as an owner or as a tenant alone should be taken into consideration to determine
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 17
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
the ceiling limit and if the land held as owner or tenant is within the ceiling limit, he
shall be entitled to purchase the land held
- 27 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 by him as a tenant. Admittedly, the respondent held the land
as an owner to the extent of 36 acres 1 gunta. The area of dispute is only in respect of
the land held by his minor son and the land allotted at a partition to his brother Ram
Chander. With regard to the land held by the son, even assuming that it is a joint
family property for the purpose of the Act and it is includable in his holding yet he is
within the ceiling limit, namely, 43 acres 35 guntas. As rightly held by the High Court
he cultivated it on behalf of his minor son. As to the land allotted to the brother of the
respondent, the tribunals below negatived it on two grounds, namely, in the
cultivation column of the revenue records it was shown that the respondent had
cultivated the land and no documentary evidence of partition was produced before
the authorities. The tribunals below did not advert to the entries in the Record of
Rights or to the factum of partition, while the High Court has taken this factor into
consideration, which in our considered view had rightly been taken into account. The
entries in the Record of Rights regarding the factum of partition is a relevant piece of
documentary evidence in support of the oral evidence given by the respondent and
his brother to prove the factum of partition. Even in the evidence of Ram Chander, he
clearly stated that there was a partition but he could not give the date and year in
which the partition was effected nor was the deed of the partition produced. Under
the Hindu law, it is not necessary that the partition should be effected by a registered
partition deed. Even a family arrangement is enough to effectuate the partition
between coparceners and to confer right to a separate share and enjoyment thereof.
Under those circumstances, when the factum of partition was evidenced by entries in
the Record of Rights, which was maintained in official course of business, the
- 28 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 correctness thereof was not questioned; it corroborates the
oral evidence given by the brother and lends assurance to accept it."
(2) In the case of K.V.Narayana Vs. K.V.Ranganadhan reported in (1976) 3 SCR 638; it is held as
under:
"Para C, D, E: It is also well settled by the decisions of this Court in Sahu Madho Das
V. Pandit, Mukund Ram and others v K. Shanmugam Pillai others that if family
arrangements which are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves or
entered into bonafide to maintain peace or to bring about harmony in the family and
the terms thereof are fair taking into consideration the circumstances of the case,
every effort must be made by the court to recognize it and sustain it. Examining the
matter in the light of these principels, we find that by the aforesaid arrangement both
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 18
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
Subramanyam Chettiar and the defendant-appellant were absolved of the
responsibility to discharge the family debts and liability was cast on Kota
Venkatalachala Pathy alone to discharge the same irrespective of the fact whether the
properties mentioned in Schedule D-1 to Exhibit A-1 ultimately turned out to be
sufficient or insufficient to meet the burden. Thus the arrangement being bonafide
and its terms being fair, we cannot but hold that it was valid and the properties
detailed in Schedule D-1 to the deed of partition became separate properties of Kota
Venkatalachala Pathy from the date of the execution of the deed of partition and are
not liable to partition."
- 29 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 (3) In the case of Kale and Others vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and
others reported in (1976) 3 SCR 202, it is held as under:
"Para F-H: The object of the arrangement is to protect the family from long drawn
litigation or perpetual strifes which mar the unity and solidarity of the family and
create hatred and bad blood between the various members of the family. Today when
we are striving to build up an egalitarian society and are trying for a complete
reconstruction of the society, to maintain and uphold the unity and homogeneity of
the family which ultimately results in the unification of the society and, therefore, of
the entire country, is the prime need of the hour. A family arrangement by which the
property is equitably divided between the various contenders so as to achieve an
equal distribution of wealth instead of concentrating the same in the hands of a few is
undoubtedly a milestone in the administrating of social justice. That is why the term
"family" has to be understood in a wider sense so as to include within its fold not only
close relations or legal heirs but even those persons who may have some sort of
antecedent title, a semblance of a claim or even if they have a spes successionise so
that future disputes are sealed for ever and the family instead of fighting claims inter
se and wasting time, money and energy on such fruitless or futile litigation is able to
devote its attention to more constructive work in the larger interest of the country.
The Courts have, therefore, leaned in favour of upholding a family arrangement
instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds. Where the Courts find
that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the rule of
estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of
- 30 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 the person who being a party to family arrangement seeks to
unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which
he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. The law in England on this point is
almost the same. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 17, Third Edition, at pp.
215-216, the following apt observations regarding the essentials of the family
settlement and the principles governing the existence of the same are made:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 19
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
"A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family,
intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by
compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the
peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving-its honour.
The agreement may be implied from a long course. Of dealing, but it is more usual to
embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term "family
arrangement" is applied.
Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to dealings
between strangers. The court, when deciding the rights of parties under family
arrangements or claims to upset such arrangements, considers what in the broadest
view of the matter is most for the interest of families, and has regard to
considerations which in dealing with transactions between persons not members of
the same family, would not be taken into account. Matters which would be fatal to the
validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections- to the binding
effect of family arrangements".
- 31 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 In other words to put the binding effect and the essentials of a family
settlement in a concretised form, the matter may be reduced into the form of the following
propositions:
(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes and
rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between the
various members of the family;
(2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be induced by fraud,
coercion or undue influence:
(3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which case no registration is
necessary;
(4) It is well-settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the
family arrangement are reduced into writing.
Here also, a distinction should be made between a document containing the terms and recitals of a
family arrangement made under the document and a mere memorandum pre pared after the family
arrangement had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for in formation of the
court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not create or
extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore does not fall within the mischief of s.
17(2) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not compulsorily registrable;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 20
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
(5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some antecedent title,
claim or interest even a possible claim in the property 'It which is acknowledged by the parties to the
- 32 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 settlement. Even if one of the parties to the settlement has no title but under
the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its claims or titles in favour of such a person and
acknowledges him to be the sole 9 owner, then the antecedent title must be assumed and the family
arrangement will be upheld and the Courts will find no difficulty in giving assent to the same;
(6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by
a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and
binding on the parties to the settlement.
The principles indicated above have been clearly enunciated and adroitly adumbrated in a long
course of decisions of this Court as also those of the Privy Council and other High Courts, which we
shall discuss presently."
(4) In the case of Potti Lakshmi Perumallu v.
Potti Krishnavenamma reported in AIR 1965 SC 825, it is held as under:
"7. No doubt, a family arrangement which is for the benefit of the family generally
can be enforced in a Court of law. But before the court would do so it must be shown
that there was an occasion for effecting a family arrangement and that it was acted
upon. It is quite clear that there is complete absence of evidence to show that there
was such an occasion or the aarrangement indicated in the will was acted upon. The
letter Ex. B12 upon which reliance was placed before the High Court on behalf of
- 33 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 the defendant has not been found by it to be genuine. The
defendant had also pleaded that the provisions under the will were given effect to but
no satisfactory evidence has been adduced to prove that the plaintiff was in
enjoyment of the properties allotted to her under the will. We cannot, therefore,
accept the second contention of Mr Desai."
(5) In the case of Umakant Rao Vs. Laliktabai and others, reported in [1988 (2) Kar. L. J.], it is held
as under:
"19. However, the document contains several other matters which do not require to
be registered. It contains the list of moveable and immoveable properties belonging
to the joint family consisting of late Sri Govinda Rao, -father of defendant-1 and the
plaintiffs and his brother Gunde Rao. It also contains a recital that late Govinda Rao
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 21
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
and Gunde Rao (defendant-3) were the members of a Hindu joint family and they
possessed moveable and immoveable properties of the joint family mentioned
therein. It also contains a declaration of defendants 1 and 3 that they did not want to
continue as members of the joint family. In other words, it contains the statement of
defendants 1 and 3 as to severance of their status as members of the joint family. A
document containing these matters is not required to be registered.
24. Section 6 of the Act.........
A partition effected only among some of the members of the family and not all the members who are
entitled to a share wilt not bind the other members who are left out. Of course, a father during his
lifetime can effect partition and divide the joint family properties without the
- 34 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 consent of his sons and this right of the father as the Patria Potestas of the
family is recognised by the Hindu Law and it is not affected by the Act.
Even if the shares allotted by the father are unequal, if the sons acquiesced in it, they will be bound
by such division. This is possible only in a case where Section 6 of the Act is not attracted. In other
words, such a case would be one in which devolution of interest does not take place and the partition
is effected in the joint family. But in a case where the devolution of interest takes place and the
proviso and the explanations to Section 6 of the Act are attracted, all persons entitled to a share in
the properties available for partition must be parties to the actual partition by metes and bounds.
Normally in such a partition all the heads of the branches and females who are entitled to a share on
partition are necessary parties to the partition effected by metes and bounds including the minors
whose interest can be represented by their natural guardians or in their absence other persons who
are authorised or entitled to act as guardians. Therefore, it follows that plaintiffs were necessary
parties to the partition effected by defendants 1 and 3. Defendant-1 could not have represented
plaintiffs 1 and 2 as by reason of their marriage during the lifetime of Govinda Rao, they had ceased
to be the members of the joint family of their father consisting of himself, defendant-1 and
defendant-2 and as such they were not members of the joint family on 26-3- 62 but they were
entitled to a share in the undivided interest left by their father Govinda Rao in the joint family
properties.
The contents of Ex.D. 1 also reveal that no share had been allotted to plaintiffs 1 and 2 and
defendant-2. It is already pointed out that defendant-1 could not have represented the
- 35 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 plaintiffs at the partition as they were neither minors nor members of the
joint family of defendant-1."

(6) In the case of Munna Lal dead by LRs. And Others v. Suraj Bhan and Others reported in (1975) 1
SCC 566, it is held as under:
"6. .......... It was therefore not necessary for the parties to execute a formal reference
or for the Punch to declare a formal written award. As a memorandum of a past
event, the document could, therefore, be received in evidence though it is not
registered. The first contention accordingly fails."
(7) In the case of Kalyani (dead) by LRs. V. Narayan and others, reported in 1980 Supp SCC 298, it
is held as under:
"12. Mr. Krishnamoorty lyer urged that even though undoubtedly a Hindu father joint
with his sons and governed by Mitakshara law has the power to partition the joint
family property, this power enables him to partition the property by metes and
bounds but he has no power merely to disrupt the joint family status unaccompanied
by division of property by metes and bounds. The limited question that needs answer
in this case is whether a Hindu father joint with his sons governed by Mitakshara law
has the power to disrupt the joint family status being a first step in the stage of
dividing the property by metes and bounds. The wider question whether a coparcener
of a coparcenary
- 36 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 governed by Mitakshara law brings about a disruption of joint
family status by definite and unequivocal indication of his intention to separate
himself from the family would constitute disruption of status qua the non- separating
members need not be examined. A Hindu father joint with his sons and governed by
Mitakshara law in contradistinction to other manager of a Hindu undivided family or
an ordinary coparcener enjoys the larger power to impose a partition on his sons with
himself as well as amongst his sons inter se without their consent and this larger
power to divide the property by metes and bounds and to allocate the shares to each
of his sons and to himself would certainly comprehend within its sweep the initial
step, viz., to disrupt the joint family status which must either precede or be
simultaneously taken with partition of property by metes and bounds. This view
taken in Kandaswami v. Doraiswami Ayyar [1880] I.L.R. 2 Mad. 317, does not appear
to have been departed from. Further, the text from Mayne's book extracted in the
preceding paragraph shows that the weight of authority is against the proposition
canvassed for by Mr. Iyer. It does, therefore, appear that a Hindu father governed by
Mitakshara law has power to partition the joint family property belonging to the joint
family consisting of himself and his sons and that this power comprehends the power
to disrupt joint family status."
24. Per contra Sri.R.V.Jayaprakash, learned counsel representing respondent No.2 contended that
after the partition in the year 1972, the properties that has fallen to the share of children of second
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 23

wife has been managed by
- 37 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 G.R.Chitrashekarappa and he has mismanaged the affairs of the joint family
properties which had fallen to the share of children of second wife through Patel Rudrappa and the
claim made by the plaintiffs have been flatly refused by the defendants resulting in filing of the suit
before the trial Court.
25. Further, he contended that taking note of the material evidence placed on record by the parties,
learned Trial Judge came to the conclusion that plaintiffs and defendants are the members of joint
family and suit schedule properties are the joint family properties by virtue of the partition that has
taken place on 30.08.1972 and other suit properties which are item Nos.6 to 19 are acquired from
the joint family funds and has rightly decreed the suit and sought for dismissal of the appeal.
26. He further contended that plaintiffs being the children of the Patel Rudrappa through his second
wife -
Kallamma and brothers of G.R.Somashekarappa,
- 38 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 G.R.Chitrashekarappa, A.G.Siddappa are entitled for the share in the joint
family properties equally along with other siblings of Patel Rudrappa and when their shares have
not been properly granted, plaintiffs had no other alternative and filed a suit for partition seeking
their 1/5th share in the suit property and same has been rightly decreed by the trial Court and
sought for dismissal of the appeal.
27. He also pointed out that defendants did not possess any independent income for acquisition of
suit item Nos.6 to 19. Admittedly, they were acquired from the agricultural income of item Nos.1 to
5, which are the joint family properties that has fallen to the share of children of Patel Rudrappa
through second wife Kallamma, soon after the death of Patel Rudrappa.
28. In support of his arguments, Sri.R.V.Jayaprakash, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has
placed reliance on the following judgments wherein it is held as under:
- 39 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
(a) In the case of Kale and Others Vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation and Others
reported in (1976) 3 Supreme Court Cases, Page 119, it is held as under:

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
"9. Before dealing with the respective contentions put forward by the parties, we
would like to discuss in general the effect and value of family arrangements entered
into between the parties with a view to resolving disputes once for all. By virtue of a
family settlement or arrangement members of a family descending from a common
ancestor or a near relation seek to sink their differences and disputes, settle and
resolve their conflicting claims or disputed titles once for all in order to buy peace of
mind and bring about complete harmony and goodwill in the family. The family
arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves and would be
enforced if honestly made. In this connection, Kerr in his valuable treatise Kerr on
Fraud at p. 364 makes the following pertinent observations regarding the nature of
the family arrangement which may be extracted thus:
"The principles which apply to the case of ordinary compromise between strangers do
not equally apply to the case of compromises in the nature of family arrangements.
Family arrangements are governed by a special equity peculiar to themselves, and
will be enforced if honestly made, although they have not been meant as a
compromise, but have proceeded from an error of all parties, originating in mistake
or ignorance of fact as to what their
- 40 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 rights actually are, or of the points on which their rights
actually depend."
The object of the arrangement is to protect the family from long-drawn litigation or perpetual strifes
which mar the unity and solidarity of the family and create hatred and bad blood between the
various members of the family. Today when we are striving to build up an egalitarian society and are
trying for a complete reconstruction of the society, to maintain .and uphold the unity and
homogeneity of the family which ultimately results in the unification of the society and, therefore, of
the entire country, is the prime need of the hour. A family arrangement by which the property is
equitably divided between the various contenders so as to achieve an equal distribution of wealth
instead of concentrating the same in the hands of a few is undoubtedly a milestone in the
administration of social justice. That is why the term "family" has to be understood in a wider sense
so as to include within its fold not only close relations or legal heirs but even those persons who may
have some sort of antecedent title, a semblance of a claim or even if they have a spes successionis so
that future disputes are sealed for ever and the family instead of fighting claims inter se and wasting
time, money and energy on such fruitless or futile litigation is able to devote its attention to more
constructive work in the larger interest of the country. The courts have, therefore, leaned in favour
of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or trivial grounds.
Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a formal defect the
rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person who being a

NC: 2023:KHC:42953 arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. The
law in England on this point is almost the same. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 17, Third
Edition, at pp. 215-216, the following apt observations regarding the essentials of the family
settlement and the principles governing the existence of the same are made:
"A family arrangement is an agreement between members of the same family,
intended to be generally and reasonably for the benefit of the family either by
compromising doubtful or disputed rights or by preserving the family property or the
peace and security of the family by avoiding litigation or by saving its honour.
The agreement may be implied from a long course of dealing, but it is more usual to
embody or to effectuate the agreement in a deed to which the term "family
arrangement" is applied.
Family arrangements are governed by principles which are not applicable to dealings
between strangers. The court, when deciding the rights of parties under family
arrangements or claims to upset such arrangements, considers what in the broadest
view of the matter is most for the interest of families, and has regard to
considerations which, in dealing with transactions between persons not members of
the same family, would not be taken into account. Matters which would be fatal to the
validity of similar transactions between strangers are not objections to the binding
effect of family arrangements."
(b) In the case of Hari Shankar Singhania and Others Vs. Gaur Hari Singhania and Others reported
- 42 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 in (2006) 4 Supreme Court Cases, Page 658, it is held as under:
"42. Another fact that assumes importance at this stage is that, a family settlement is
treated differently from any other formal commercial settlement as such settlement
in the eye of the law ensures peace and goodwill among the family members. Such
family settlements generally meet with approval of the courts. Such settlements are
governed by a special equity principle where the terms are fair and bona fide, taking
into account the well-being of a family.
43. The concept of "family arrangement or settlement" and the present one in hand,
in our opinion, should be treated differently. Technicalities of limitation, etc. should
not be put at risk of the implementation of a settlement drawn by a family, which is
essential for maintaining peace and harmony in a family. Also it can be seen from
decided cases of this Court that, any such arrangement would be upheld if family
settlements were entered into to allay disputes existing or apprehended and even any
dispute or difference apart, if it was entered into bona fide to maintain peace or to
bring about harmony in the family. Even a semblance of a claim or some other

ground, as say affection, may suffice as observed by this Court in Ram Charan Das v.
Girjanandini Devi [(1965) 3 SCR 841 : AIR 1966 SC 323]
53. Therefore, in our opinion, technical considerations should give way to peace and
harmony in the enforcement of family arrangements or settlements."

(c) In the case of Ravinder Kaur Greval and Others Vs. Manjit Kaur and Others reported in (2020) 9
Supreme Court Cases, Page 706, it is held as under:
25. Be that as it may, the High Court has clearly misapplied the dictum in the relied
upon decisions.
The settled legal position is that when by virtue of a family settlement or arrangement, members of a
family descending from a common ancestor or a near relation seek to sink their differences and
disputes, settle and resolve their conflicting claims or disputed titles once and for all in order to buy
peace of mind and bring about complete harmony and goodwill in the family, such arrangement
ought to be governed by a special equity peculiar to them and would be enforced if honestly made.
The object of such arrangement is to protect the family from long- drawn litigation or perpetual
strives which mar the unity and solidarity of the family and create hatred and bad blood between the
various members of the family, as observed in Kale [Kale v. Director of Consolidation, (1976) 3 SCC
119] . In the said reported decision, a three-Judge Bench of this Court had observed thus: (Kale case
[Kale v. Director of Consolidation, (1976) 3 SCC 119] , SCC pp. 125-26, para 9) "9. ... A family
arrangement by which the property is equitably divided between the various contenders so as to
achieve an equal distribution of wealth instead of concentrating the same in the hands of a few is
undoubtedly a milestone in the administration of social justice. That is why the term "family" has to
be understood in a wider sense so as to include
- 44 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 within its fold not only close relations or legal heirs but even those persons
who may have some sort of antecedent title, a semblance of a claim or even if they have a spes
successionis so that future disputes are sealed for ever and the family instead of fighting claims inter
se and wasting time, money and energy on such fruitless or futile litigation is able to devote its
attention to more constructive work in the larger interest of the country. The courts have, therefore,
leaned in favour of upholding a family arrangement instead of disturbing the same on technical or
trivial grounds. Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or a
formal defect the rule of estoppel is pressed into service and is applied to shut out plea of the person
who being a party to family arrangement seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the
family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits."

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
26. In para 10 of the said decision, the Court has delineated the contours of essentials of a family
settlement as follows: (Kale case [Kale v. Director of Consolidation, (1976) 3 SCC 119] , SCC pp.
126-27) "10. In other words to put the binding effect and the essentials of a family settlement in a
concretised form, the matter may be reduced into the form of the following propositions:
'(1) The family settlement must be a bona fide one so as to resolve family disputes
and rival claims by a fair and equitable division or allotment of properties between
the various members of the family;
- 45 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 (2) The said settlement must be voluntary and should not be
induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence;
(3) The family arrangement may be even oral in which case no registration is
necessary;
(4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the
family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made
between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made
[Ed.: The words between two asterisks have been emphasised in original as well.]
under the document [Ed.: The words between two asterisks have been emphasised in
original as well.] and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangement
had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the
court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not
create or extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore does not fall
within the mischief of Section 17(2) of the Registration Act and is, therefore, not
compulsorily registrable;
(5) The members who may be parties to the family arrangement must have some
antecedent title, claim or interest even a possible claim in the property which is
acknowledged by the parties to the settlement. Even if one of the parties to the
settlement has no title but under the arrangement the other party relinquishes all its
claims or titles in favour of such a person and acknowledges him to be the sole owner,
then the antecedent title must
- 46 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 be assumed and the family arrangement will be upheld and the courts will
find no difficulty in giving assent to the same;
(6) Even if bona fide disputes, present or possible, which may not involve legal claims are settled by
a bona fide family arrangement which is fair and equitable the family arrangement is final and
binding on the parties to the settlement.'"

(d) In the case of K.Venkataramaiah Vs. A. Seetharama Reddy and Others reported in
AIR 1963 Supreme Court, Page 1526, it is held as under:
"16. In view of what the High Court has stated in this passage it is not possible to say
that the High Court made the order for admission of additional evidence without
applying its mind. It seems clear that the High Court thought, on a consideration of
the evidence, in the light of the arguments that had been addressed already before it
that it would assist them to arrive at the truth on the question of Seetharam Reddy's
age if the entries in the admission registers of the school were made available. It was
vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that there was such a
volume of evidence before the High Court that it could not be seriously suggested that
the Court required any additional evidence "to enable it to pronounce judgment". The
requirement, it has to be remembered, was the requirement of the High Court, and it
will not be right for us to examine the evidence to find out whether we would have
required such additional evidence to enable "us" to pronounce judgment. Apart from
this, it is well to remember
- 47 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 that the appellate court has the power to allow additional
evidence not only if it requires such evidence "to enable it to pronounce judgment"
but also for "any other substantial cause". There may well be cases where even though
the court finds that it is able to pronounce judgment on the state of the record as it is,
and so, it cannot strictly say that it requires additional evidence "be enable it to
pronounce judgment", it still considers that in the interest of justice something which
remains obscure should be filled up so that it can pronounce its judgment in a more
satisfactory manner. Such a case will be one for allowing additional evidence "for any
other substantial cause" under Rule 27(1)(b) of the Code."
(e) In the case of Wadi Vs. Amilal and Others reported in (2015) 1 Supreme Court Cases, Page 667, is
held as under:
"5. Now it is clear that Rule 27 deals with production of additional evidence in the
appellate court. The general principle incorporated in sub-rule (1) is that the parties
to an appeal are not entitled to produce additional evidence (oral or documentary) in
the appellate court to cure a lacuna or fill up a gap in a case. The exceptions to that
principle are enumerated thereunder in clauses (a), (aa) and (b).
We are concerned here with clause (b) which is an enabling provision. It says that if the appellate
court requires any document to be produced or any witness to be examined to enable it to
pronounce judgment, it may allow such document to be produced or witness to be examined. The
requirement or need is that of the appellate court

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 bearing in mind that the interest of justice is paramount. If it feels that
pronouncing a judgment in the absence of such evidence would result in a defective decision and to
pronounce an effective judgment admission of such evidence is necessary, clause (b) enables it to
adopt that course. Invocation of clause (b) does not depend upon the vigilance or negligence of the
parties for it is not meant for them. It is for the appellant to resort to it when on a consideration of
the material or record it feels that admission of additional evidence is necessary to pronounce a
satisfactory judgment in the case."
(f) In the case of Bacchaj Naha Vs. Nilima Mandal and Another reported in (2008) 17 SCC Page 491,
is held as under:
"11. The Civil Procedure Code is an elaborate codification of the principles of natural justice to be
applied to civil litigation. The provisions are so elaborate that many a time, fulfilment of the
procedural requirements of the Code may itself contribute to delay. But any anxiety to cut the delay
or further litigation should not be a ground to flout the settled fundamental rules of civil procedure.
Be that as it may. We will briefly set out the reasons for the aforesaid conclusions.
12. The object and purpose of pleadings and issues is to ensure that the litigants come to trial with
all issues clearly defined and to prevent cases being expanded or grounds being shifted during trial.
Its object is also to ensure that each side is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised or
considered so that they may have an opportunity of
- 49 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 placing the relevant evidence appropriate to the issues before the court for its
consideration. This Court has repeatedly held that the pleadings are meant to give to each side
intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable courts to determine what is really
at issue between the parties, and to prevent any deviation from the course which litigation on
particular causes must take.
13. The object of issues is to identify from the pleadings the questions or points required to be
decided by the courts so as to enable parties to let in evidence thereon. When the facts necessary to
make out a particular claim, or to seek a particular relief, are not found in the plaint, the court
cannot focus the attention of the parties, or its own attention on that claim or relief, by framing an
appropriate issue. As a result the defendant does not get an opportunity to place the facts and
contentions necessary to repudiate or challenge such a claim or relief. Therefore, the court cannot,
on finding that the plaintiff has not made out the case put forth by him, grant some other relief. The
question before a court is not whether there is some material on the basis of which some relief can
be granted. The question is whether any relief can be granted, when the defendant had no
opportunity to show that the relief proposed by the court could not be granted. When there is no
prayer for a particular relief and no pleadings to support such a relief, and when the defendant has
no opportunity to resist or oppose such a relief, if the court considers and grants such a relief, it will
lead to miscarriage of justice. Thus it is said that no amount of evidence, on a plea that is not put
forward in the pleadings, can be looked into to grant any relief.

NC: 2023:KHC:42953
14. The High Court has ignored the aforesaid principles relating to the object and necessity of
pleadings. Even though right of easement was not pleaded or claimed by the plaintiffs, and even
though parties were at issue only in regard to title and possession, it made out for the first time in
second appeal, a case of easement and granted relief based on an easementary right. For this
purpose, it relied upon the following observations of this Court in Nedunuri Kameswaramma v.
Sampati Subba Rao [AIR 1963 SC 884] : (AIR p. 886, para 6) "6. ... No doubt, no issue was framed,
and the one, which was framed, could have been more elaborate; but since the parties went to trial
fully knowing the rival case and led all the evidence not only in support of their contentions but in
refutation of those of the other side, it cannot be said that the absence of an issue was fatal to the
case, or that there was that mistrial which vitiates proceedings. We are, therefore, of opinion that
the suit could not be dismissed on this narrow ground, and also that there is no need for a remit, as
the evidence which has been led in the case is sufficient to reach the right conclusion."
But the said observations were made in the context of absence of an issue, and not absence of
pleadings."
29. In the light of the arguments putforth on both the sides and the principles of law enunciated in
the
- 51 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 decisions relied on by the parties, following points would raise for
consideration:
1. Whether there was partition of the family properties possessed by Patel Rudrappa
as is contended in the plaint on 30.08.1972 representing the share of first wife
children by Kallappa and share of second wife children by A.Gurushantappa?
2. If so, whether the said partition binds the parties?
3. Whether the plaintiffs have got independent right to seek for partition of 1/5th
share in the suit properties in the light of partition that has been taken place on
30.08.1972?
4. If so, whether the plaintiffs are entitled for share and what extent?
5. Whether the impugned judgment is suffering from legal infirmity or perversity and
thus calls interference of this Court?
6. What order?

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
- 52 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 REG.POINT NOS.1 TO 5:
30. From the material evidence placed on record, there is no dispute that plaintiffs and defendant
Nos.1 to 3 are the children of Patel Rudrappa through second wife kallamma. Said Kallamma died in
the year 1984.
According to plaintiffs, soon after the death of Patel Rudrappa, in the year 1968, there was a
partition in respect of the properties left behind by Patel Rudrappa in the year 1972. The said
partition is a registered partition, dated 30.08.1972. Same is marked at Ex.P.1. Recitals of Ex.P.1
would establish that Kallappa being the eldest son of Patel Rudrappa through first wife -
Shantamma represented himself, his mother Shantamma and his brothers and sisters.
31. Likewise, on behalf of the children of Patel Rudrappa through second wife - kallamma, eldest son
A.Gurushantappa (plaintiff No.1) represented his mother Kallamma and his brothers and sisters.
- 53 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
32. In other words, all the sharers are not parties to the partition although, they were majors.
Therefore, the alleged partition that has taken place in the year 1972, Kallappa representing first
wife and children of Patel Rudrappa and A.Gurushantappa representing his second wife and
children cannot be countenanced in law.
33. In this regard, the arguments that are putforth on behalf of the plaintiffs that it is a registered
document and it has been acted upon. If the said argument is to be accepted, there was no necessity
for subsequent partition that is said to have taken place in the year 1981, 1988, 1989 and 1993.
Plaintiffs have no doubt flatly refused that subsequent partitions that have taken place as referred to
supra. But the material evidence on record especially, the sharing of the properties after 1972 and
the revenue records being mutated subsequent thereto, would clearly show that even after 1972,
there were several adjustments and divisions that has taken place in the year 1981, 1988, 1989 and
1993.
- 54 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
34. No doubt the proceedings before the revenue authorities has not resulted in favour of the
plaintiffs. But it is settled principles of law that mere revenue entries cannot be considered as title to
the property. In other words, plaintiffs are claiming 1/5th share in the suit properties by contending
that after getting the share of item Nos.1 to 5 of the suit properties in the partition that has taken
place in the year 1972, the income from those properties are utilised for the purchase of suit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 32
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
schedule properties mentioned in the schedule as item Nos.6 to 19.
35. In this regard, voluminous documentary evidence is placed on record by both the parties and
there is sufficient oral evidence. The oral evidence placed on behalf of the plaintiffs is only that of
the plaintiff No.2.
36. As against the same, defendants have placed the oral evidence of defendant No.2 -
G.R.Chitrashekharappa and also six witnesses viz.,
- 55 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 Siddappa, Rudrappa, K.Ikbal, M.Thimmappa, Chandrashekharapa,
M.G.Jayadevappa respectively.
37. In other words, the oral testimony of P.W.1 and D.W.1 though it is to be considered oath against
oath, the oral evidence of D.W.2 to D.W.7 would go to show that there were some acquisitions of the
properties by the defendants independently other than by utilising the joint family funds.
38. It is settled principle of law and requires no emphasis that plaintiffs in order to claim that suit
item Nos.6 to 19 are acquired out of joint family income, initial burden is to be discharged by the
plaintiffs by placing necessary evidence on record that there was sufficient joint family nucleus and
after meeting day-to-day income expenses, there was surplus in the joint family and that surplus
income is being utilised for acquisition of suit item Nos.6 to 19.
- 56 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
39. On cumulative analysis of evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs in this regard, there is no specific
pleading or evidence placed on record by the plaintiffs to show that suit item Nos.6 to 19 are
acquired out of joint family income. P.W.1 has not stated in his oral evidence as to what is the joint
family income and how much amount was utilised for day-to-day expenses and what was the surplus
that was remaining in the joint family income.
40. In the case on hand, since there is a serious dispute as to very partition that is said to have been
taken place in the year 1972 by defendant Nos.1 to 3, the trial Court ought to have raised an issue
with regard to the validity of registered partition taken placed on 30.08.1972.
No doubt in issue No.2, learned Trial Judge has placed the burden on the defendants that partition
that has taken place on 30.08.1972 has not been acted upon and held the said issue No2 in
'negative'. Since, this is the first appeal filed under Section 96 of CPC, this Court can very well go
- 57 -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 33
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 into the question of validity of the partition that has taken place on
30.08.1972.
41. When the material evidence on record is looked into and especially, probative value of Ex.P.1 is
considered, in the light of the above factual aspects of the matter, since all the sharers are not parties
to the partition deed dated 30.08.1972 as per Ex.P.1, the said partition cannot be considered as a
partition among the family members.
42. At this stage, Sri.R.V.Jayaprakash, learned counsel contended that assuming for a moment that
it cannot be construed as a registered partition deed settling the rights of all sharers, the same can
be considered as an family settlement.
43. The said arguments of Sri.R.V.Jayaprakash, learned counsel cannot be countenanced in law,
inasmuch as even for the family settlement, consent of all the
- 58 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 sharers is very much necessary more so, when they are majors as on the date
of family settlement.
44. One of the signatories to Ex.P.1 being plaintiff No.1, for the reasons best known did not step into
the witness box to depose before the Court that he had been authorised by plaintiff No.2 and
defendants to enter into a partition with the children of first wife of Patel Rudrappa.
45. As such, the division said to have taken place by granting suit item Nos.1 to 5 for the children of
second wife of Patel Rudrappa and remaining properties of Patel Rudrappa, through children of first
wife cannot be considered as a valid partition for more than one reasons.
46. Firstly, no shares were granted to the daughters born to the first wife or the second wife.
47. Secondly, if there was any notional partition, one minute earlier to the death of Patel Rudrappa,
by
- 59 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 operation of law, Patel Rudrappa would get 1/4th share along with his three
sons born through first wife -
Shantamma viz., Kallappa, Rudrappa, Shivalingappa respectively. It is only the share of Patel
Rudrappa that needs to be divided among first wife - Shantamma and her seven children together
with eight children of second wife
- Kallamma. In otherwords, children of first wife and second wife would get 1/4th share of Patel
Rudrappa apart from the share derived by the son of Patel Rudrappa through first wife.

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
48. The view of this Court in this regard is supported by the judgment of the coordinate Bench of
this Court in the case of Kenchegowda vs K.B.Krishnappa reported in ILR 2008 KAR 3453 wherein
it is held as under:
"17. Prior to the Act, 1955 there was no prohibition for a Hindu to have more than one
wife. Therefore, all the children born to the said wife were treated as legitimate
children and members of joint family or co-parcenary. It is only a child born to
concubine was treated as illegitimate child. Each one of these legitimate children had
aright to maintain a
- 60 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 suit against their father for partition and separate possession
of their legitimate share either in the joint family property or in the co-parcenary
property. After the passing of the Act, 1955 a prohibition was imposed on the Hindus
to enter into second marriage during the life time of the spouse. The personal law of
Hindus to that extent ceases to have effect. The Act had over-riding effect and the
Personal Law of Hindus in so far as the marriages are concerned stood amended in
terms of the Act. Therefore second marriage of a Hindu during the life time of the
spouse is prohibited and such a marriage was declared as void. A son born to the said
void marriage was deprived of a right under the Traditional Hindu Law because the
provisions of the Act, excluded the application of personal law in this regard and
under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, for short hereinafter referred to as
"Succession Act", because he was not a legitimate son. The Parliament after noticing
this injustice done to an illegitimate child for the folly of its parents thought of
introducing Section 16 to the Act. It reads as under:
"16. Legitimacy of children of void and voidable marriages - (1) Notwithstanding that
a marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would
have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid/shall be, legitimate, whether such
child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment)
Act, 1976 (68 of 1976), and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect of
that marriage under this Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void
otherwise than on a petition under this Act.
- 61 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 (2) Where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of a voidable marriage
under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made, who would have been
the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at the date of the decree it had been dissolved
instead of being annulled, shall be deemed to be their legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of
nullity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 35
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
(3) Nothing contained in sub-Section (1) of sub- section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon
any child of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under
Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where,
but for the passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring any
such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents."
By Section 16, what the Parliament intended to do was to remove the stigma of bastardliness
attached to a child born of such void marriage and the child has been relegated the status of a
legitimate child. Therefore, after the amendment Act 1976 which introduced Section 16 into the Act,
the illegitimate son has been given equal status as that of a legitimate son. That is precisely what is
sought to be done under Section 16(1) and (2) of the Act. However, the parliament, was conscious of
the consequences of such status being given to an illegitimate child as it would affect other persons
who are in no way responsible for the birth of an illegitimate child. Therefore, they made it clear by
introducing Section 16(3) to the effect that such an
- 62 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 illegitimate son who is admitted to be a legitimate son by virtue of Section
16(1) and (2), will have a right only in the properties of the parents and none else. Thus, the
conferring of the status did not affect the rights of the persons other than the parents in the
property.
18. The vires of the said provision was challenged before the Supreme Court in the case of
Parayankandiyal Eravath Kanapra Van Kalllaniamma v. K. Devi [(1996) 4 SCC 76.] reported in.
After referring to the old text of Hindu Law which pointed out that marriage according to Hindu
Law is holy union, it is not a contract but a samskara or sacrament, though polygamy was not
permitted, a second marriage was allowed in a restricted sense and that too under stringent
circumstances. It also noticed that Monogamy was the rule and ethos of the Hindu society which
derided a second marriage and rejected it altogether. The touch of religion in all marriages did not
allow polygamy to become a part of Hindu culture. Therefore, noticing the various enactments
which dealt with the marriage through out the length and breadth of this Country, it held that it
became necessary for the parliament to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among
Hindus and that is how the said enactment was passed. After noticing the various provisions in the
said enactment, they also noticed the background in which Section 16 was introduced. Thereafter
dealing with the amendment, this is what the Supreme Court has held:
"The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 is a beneficent legislation and, therefore, it has to be
interpreted in such a manner as advances the object of the legislation. The Act
intends to

legitimacy on a group of innocent children, who are otherwise treated as bastards, is

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
the prime object of Section 16".
"Section 16 was earlier linked with Sections 11 and 12. On account of the language
employed in unamended Section 16 and its linkage with Sections 11 and 12, the
provisions had the effect of dividing and classifying the illegitimate children into two
groups without there being any nexus between the statutory provisions and the object
sought to be achieved thereby. It is to be seen whether this mischief has been
removed".
"Section 16 contains a legal fiction. It is by a rule of fictio juris that the legislature has
provided that children, though illegitimate, shall, nevertheless, be treated as
legitimate notwithstanding that the marriage was void or voidable."
"In view of the legal fiction contained in Section 16, the illegitimate children, for all
practical purposes, including succession to the properties of their parents, have to be
treated as legitimate. They cannot however, succeed to the properties of any other
relation on the basis of this rule, which in its operation, is limited to the properties of
the parents."
19. In fact, the Division Bench of this Court had a occasion to consider the scope of Section 16 in the
case of Patel Chandrappa v. Hanumanthappa [ILR
- 64 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 1989 Kar 2384.] . This Court after reviewing the case law on the point held as
under:
"Thus as far a conferment of right upon a child born out of a marriage which is null
and void or annulled by a decree of nullity in or to the property of this parents is
concerned, there is no change made in the law by Act 68/1976. The same provision
was contained in the old Section as contained in the present Section 16. The words
"any right in or to the property of any person other than the parents" occurring in
sub-Section (3) of Section 16 of the Act are very material for our consideration. From
the aforesaid words, it is clear that it is only in the property of the parents such
children are given a right and not in any other property of any other person.
A coparcenary property cannot in law be construed to be the exclusive property of
any of the coparceners. By sub-Section (3) of Section 16 of the Act, the Parliament has
limited right of a child falling under sub- Sections (1) of (2) of Section 16 to claim
properties. It has limited the right of such a child to the property of his/her parents.
In the absence of sub-Section (3) and in view of conferment of legitimacy upon a
child falling under sub-Section (1) or (2) of Section 16 of the Act, in the case of a male
child, he would have been entitled to be treated in par with the other legitimate sons
of his father as a coparcenet of the joint family of which the father of such a child is a

member. The parliament by a fiction of law having conferred legitimacy on a child
covered by sub-Section (1) or (2) of Section 16 of the Act, keeping in
- 65 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 view the concepts of Hindu Law, has restricted the operation of the fiction
and has made sit operative to the extent of the property of the parents of such child by restricting
the right of such child in or to the property of his/her parents. Therefore, the Court must endeavour
to see that the legitimacy conferred upon a child born out of a void marriage does not exceed its
limitation as laid down in sub- Section (3) of Section 16 of the Act. The reason for the parliament to
restrict the right of a child born out of a void marriage covered by sub- Section (1) or (2) of Section
16 of the Act on whom the legitimacy is conferred, is not far to see. In this context it is necessary and
relevant to remember that the concepts of 'joint family', 'coparcenary property' or joint family
property' and the right of a coparcener to acquire by birth an interest in the joint family or
coparcenary property, are well-known and the Parliament was well aware of these concepts and it
did not want them to be affected. Therefore, keeping in view these concepts, the proviso to old
Section 16 and sub-section (3) of the present Section 16, limited the right of a child falling under
sub-Section (1) or (2) of Section 16 of the Act to the property of his/her parents.
The devolution of coparcenary property is also kept in tact by the Hindu Succession Act, Section 6 of
the Hindu Succession Act specifically provides for devolution of interest in a coparcenary property.
Section 8 of the same Act specifically, provides the Rules of succession to the property of a male
Hindu dying intestate. Coparcenary property devolves
- 66 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 by survivorship whereas the property of a male Hindu devolves by succession
sub-Section (3) of Section 16 of the Act has to be understood, interpreted and applied in the
background of the concepts of joint family coparcener, coparcenary property and Sections 6 and 8 of
the Hindu Succession Act. The conferment of right upon a child born out of a void marriage in or to
the property of the parents is not introduced for the first time by the Marriage Laws (Amendment)
Act, 1976. It was there in the proviso to old Section 16 of the Act. Thus we are of the view that
sub-Sections (1) to (3) of Section 16 of the Act read together, do not confer upon a child born out of a
void marriages falling under sub-sections (1) or (2) of Section 16 of the Act the status of a
'coparcener' and do not entitle him to claim a share in the joint family or coparcenary property."
20. Again yet another Division Bench of this Court in the case of Smt. Sarojamma v. Smt. Neelamma
[ILR 2005 Kar 3293.] , interpreting Section 16 held as under:
"Sub-Section (1) of Section 16 of the Act provides that notwithstanding that a
marriage is null and void under Section 11, any child of such marriage who would
have been legitimate if the marriage had been valid, shall be legitimate whether such
child is born before or after the commencement of the Marriage Laws (Amendment)
act, 1976 (Act 68 of 1976), and whether or not a decree of nullity is granted in respect
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 38
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
of that marriage under the Act and whether or not the marriage is held to be void
- 67 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 otherwise than on a petition under the Act. Sub-Section (2)
further provides that where a decree of nullity is granted in respect of voidable
marriage under Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is
made, who would have been the legitimate child of the parties to the marriage if at
the date of the decree is had been dissolved instead of being annulled, shall be
deemed to be the legitimate notwithstanding the decree for nullity is made.
Sub-Section (3) of the said Section further provides that nothing contained in
sub-Section (1) or sub-Section (2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a
marriage which is null and void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under
Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, but
for the passing of the Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or
acquiring any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his
parents."
21. Similar is the view taken by the High Court of Bombay, Madras and Andhra Pradesh. In the
aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court in (1996) 4 SCC 76, the question involved was, 'what is the
status of a an illegitimate child after the introduction of Section 16?' The said judgment did not go
into the question as to what are the properties in respect of which the said child can claim a share.
That fell for consideration before the Supreme Court in the case of Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram
Manjhi [(2003) 1 SCC 730.] . The argument canvassed before the Supreme Court in the aforesaid
case was that once the children born out of void and illegal marriage have been specifically
safeguarded under Section 16,
- 68 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 as amended by Central act 68 of 1976, there is no justification to deny them
equal treatment on a par with the children born of the wife in lawful wedlock by countenancing
claims for inheritance even in the ancestral coparcenary property. When once Section 16 chose to
legitimate the children born of such void marriages, the prohibition must be held to have been
relaxed and the stigma wiped out so as to render the progency, legitimate for all purposes and
therefore, the provisions of Section 16(3) of the Act also should be construed keeping in view the
totality or circumstances and the object and purpose of the legislation in respect of the right to
inherit property also like the children born out of lawful wedlock.
22. After considering the said argument, the Supreme Court held asunder:
"We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel of either side.
The Hindu Marriage Act underwent important changes by virtue of the Marriage
Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976, which came into force with effect from 27-5-1976.
Under the ordinary law, a child for being treated as legitimate must be born in lawful
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 39
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
wedlock. If the marriage itself is void on account of contravention of the statutory
prescriptions, any child born of such marriage would have the effect, per se, or on
being so declared or annulled, as the case may be, of bastardizing the children born of
the parties to such marriage. Polygamy, which was permissible and widely prevalent
among the Hindus in the past and considered to have evil effects on society, came to
be put an end to by the mandate of parliament in enacting the Hindu Marriage Act,
1955. The legitimate status of
- 69 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 the children which depended very much upon the marriage
between their parents being valid or void, thus turned on the act of the parents over
which the innocent child had no hold or control. But, for no fault of it, the innocent
baby had to suffer a permanent setback in life and in the eye of society by being
treated as illegitimate. A laudable and noble act of the legislature indeed in enacting
Section 16 to put an end to a great social evil. At the same time, Section 16 of the Act,
while engrafting a rule of fiction in ordaining the children, though illegitimate, to be
treated as legitimate, notwithstanding that the marriage was void or voidable chose
also to confine its application, so far as succession or inheritance by such children is
concerned, to the properties of the parents only."
"So far as Section 16 of the Act is concerned, though it was enacted to legitimise
children, who would otherwise suffer by becoming illegitimate, at the same time it
expressly provides in sub-Section (3) by engrafting a provision with a non obstante
clause stipulating specifically that nothing contained in sub-Section (1) or sub-section
(2) shall be construed as conferring upon any child of a marriage, which is null and
void or which is annulled by a decree of nullity under Section 12, "any rights in or to
the property of any person, other than the parents, in any case where, but for the
passing of this Act, such child would have been incapable of possessing or acquiring
any such rights by reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents". In the
light of such an express
- 70 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 mandate of the legislature itself, there is no room for
according upon such children who but for Section 16 would have been branded as
illegitimate any further rights than envisaged therein by resorting to any presumptive
or inferential process of reasoning, having recourse to the mere object or purpose of
enacting Section 16 of the Act. Any attempt to do so would amount to doing not only
violence to the provision specifically engrafted in sub-Section (3) of Section 16 of the
Act but also would attempt to court relegislating on the subject under the guise of
interpretation against even the will expressed in the enactment itself."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 40
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
23. Therefore, it follows that Section 16 of the Act contains a legal fiction. It is by a rule of 'fictio
juris' that the legislature has provided that, children though illegitimate shall nevertheless, be
treated as legitimate notwithstanding that the marriage was void or voidable. However, it is a legal
fiction with limitation. The reason behind such limitation is that the Parliament had no intention of
eclipsing the settled concepts of Hindu Law such as coparcenary, coparcener, coparcenary property,
joint family and joint family property, right of coparcener to acquire by birth and interest in the
coparcenary or joint family property, under Mitakshara Law. Therefore, the object sought to be
achieved by this provision is two fold. Firstly the restoration of status. For the act of the parents over
which the innocent child had no control, and for no fault of it, had to suffer a permanent set back in
life and being called a bastard, an illegitimate child. This social evil was wiped out. For all practical
purposes the child was treated as a legitimate child born out of a lawful
- 71 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 wedlock. Secondly, the cause for such a status of affair was their parents.
Therefore, in the properties of the parents equal rights are given to such children, as that of the
children born of lawful wedlock. After achieving this twin object, the Parliament took care to see that
conferment of status and right to property on the illegitimate child did not invade the rights of
others, who are also innocent and who are in no way responsible for this sorry state of affairs. Thus,
the illegitimate child covered by Section (1) or (2) of Section 16 of the Act, even on conferment of
legitimacy, was not allowed by law to claim equal status under Hindu Law as that of a legitimate
child. Though by the aforesaid provision the illegitimate child has been conferred the status of a
legitimate child, it did not confer the status of a coparcener. Consequently, such a child did not
acquire any right by birth in any property much less coparcenary or joint family property. In the
light of the express words used in the provision which clearly sets out the legislative intent, in
particular sub- section (3) of Section 16, any attempt on the part of the Courts to expand the scope of
the said provision, and confer rights on such child in coparcenary or joint family property amounts
to relegislating on the subject, under the guise of interpretation, against the will of the Parliament
clearly expressed in the enactment itself. It is impermissible.
24. Sri. B.T. Parthasarathy, learned Senior Counsel relying on Section 307 of Hindu Law by Mull a,
contended that every adult co-parcenery is entitled to demand and sue for partition of the co-
parcenary property at any time. Therefore, he contends that in the absence of any prohibition in any
law, a son can maintain a suit against his father for partition of his separate property also.
- 72 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
25. Under the Hindu law, a Hindu son in the area covered by Mitakshara law acquires right in the
co- parcenary property by birth. Therefore, he can maintain a suit against his father in respect of his
right which he acquires by birth. That is what is precisely stated in Section 307 referred to supra.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 41
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
"307. Sons, grandsons and great-grandsons- Every adult coparcener is entitled to
demand and sue for partition of the coparcenary property at any time".
26. The said right is confined to only co-parcenary property and joint family property. The said right
is not extended even in Hindu law to the separate or self acquired property of the father. After the
passing of the Succession Act, the rights of Hindus in respect of the property of the father is
governed by the said enactment. The said enactment was passed to amend and codify the law
relating, intestate succession among Hindus. The word "intestate" has been defined under Section
3(g) meaning, a person is deemed to die intestate in respect of property of which he or she has not
made a testamentary disposition capable of taking effect. In other words, if a person has made a
testamentary disposition of his property and if such testamentary disposition is up held, then his
natural heirs have no right to succeed or to inherit the said property.
27. Section 6 of the Act deals with devolution of interest in coparcenary property. It provides that
when a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death an
interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the property shall devolve by
survivorship upon the
- 73 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 surviving members of the co-parcenary and not in accordance with this Act.
Therefore, it is clear that in respect of a co-parcenary property to which the Succession Act, 1956 is
not applicable, such devolution of interest is governed by the Personal Law of Hindus. Coparcenary
property devolves by survivorship and not by succession.
28. It is Section 8 which deals with the General Rules of succession in the case of males. It provides
that property of a male Hindu dying inte state shall devolve according to the provisions of the
Succession Act. Therefore, under the Succession Act, a legal heir of a person is entitled to property
only on the death of the male dying intestate. In other words, he has no right to claim a share in the
property during the lifetime of the male as defined in Section 8 of the Succession Act. Thus, the
property of a Hindu dying intestate devolves by succession only."
49. There was an argument that children of second wife should also be treated as coparceners along
with children of first wife. Said aspect was considered by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Revanasiddappa Vs. Mallikarjun reported in 2023 SCC Online SC 1087 as referred to supra. The
Hon'ble Apex Court after considering the relevant aspects of the matter, by order dated 01.09.2023,
has ruled that children of second wife cannot be treated as coparceners along with the
- 74 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 legitimate children born to a common propositus. The decision of
Revanasiddappa Vs. Mallikarjun reported in 2023 SCC Online SC 1087 and relevant portion of the
judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 42
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
"56. In terms of Section 10, the division of property of an intestate among the heirs in
Class I is governed by the four Rules extracted above. They stipulate that:
(i) the widow or if there is more than one all of them together shall take one share;
(ii) the surviving sons and daughters and mother shall each take one share; and
(iii) heirs in the branch of each pre-deceased son or each pre-deceased daughter take
between them one share.
57. Rule 2 of Section 10 stipulates that "the surviving sons and daughters and the mother of the
intestate shall each take one share". In using the expression "surviving sons and daughters" the
HSA, 1956 has not made any distinction based on the legitimacy of the child. Parliament, following
well- settled principles of interpretation, would be cognizant of the legitimacy granted by the
provisions of Section 16 of the HMA, 1955 and the widening of the protection by the substitution of
the provision in 1976. There is no reason or justification to qualify the provisions of Rule 2 of
Section 10 with reference to the legitimacy of the child. Hence in dividing the property of an
intestate in terms of Section 10 of the HSA, 1956, no distinction can be made on the basis of such a
classification, once such a child is deemed legitimate under Section 16 of the HMA, 1955. Such
- 75 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 a construction shall also accord with the provisions of sub-section (3) of
Section 16 of the HMA, 1955 which enunciates that the conferment of legitimacy by sub- section (1)
or sub-section (2) shall not confer on a such a child "any rights in or to the property of any person,
other than the parents".
58. Section 10 of the HSA, 1956 provides for the division of "the property of an intestate" among the
heirs in Class I of the Schedule. The expression "property of an intestate'" means property that
belongs to the intestate. The Explanation to sub- section (3) of Section 6 provides for the
ascertainment of the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener which is deemed to be the share in
the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition had taken place immediately before
his death. That share as ascertained in terms of the Explanation to sub-section (3) of Section 6
would devolve on the basis of the principles enunciated in Section 8 and has to be distributed among
the Class I heirs in terms of Section 10.
59. Class I of the Schedule is in the following terms:
"Son; daughter; widow; mother; son of a pre-deceased son; daughter of a
pre-deceased son; son of a pre-deceased daughter; daughter of a pre-deceased
daughter; widow of a pre- deceased son; son of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased
son; daughter of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son; widow of a pre- deceased
son of a pre-deceased son; [son of a pre-deceased daughter of a pre-deceased
daughter; daughter of a pre-deceased daughter of a pre-deceased daughter; daughter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 43
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
of a pre- deceased son of a pre-deceased daughter;
- 76 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 daughter of a pre-deceased daughter of a pre- deceased son]."
60. For the purpose of the distribution of the property of the deceased, Class I uses the expression
"son" and "daughter". The property which falls for distribution is the share of the deceased in the
coparcenary property on the basis of a notional partition having taken place immediately prior to
the death. The property to be distributed is that of the deceased. The Explanation to sub-section (3)
of Section 6 postulates that a notional partition has taken place immediately prior to the death of the
coparcener and his interest is deemed to be the share that would have been allotted to him in such a
partition. The legislature, in other words, has provided for the ascertainment of the share of the
deceased on a notional basis. The expression "share in the property that would have been allotted to
him if a partition of the property had taken place"
indicates that this share represents the property of the deceased. Where the deceased
dies intestate, the property would devolve in terms of Section 8 and the distribution
would be governed by the Rules specified in Section 10.
61. When a Hindu dies after the commencement of the amending Act of 2005, his interest in the
property of a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara law has to devolve by testamentary or
intestate succession and not by survivorship, as stipulated in sub-section (3) of Section 6. The
interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener, for the purpose of sub-section (3) has to be ascertained
on the basis that a notional partition has taken place immediately before his death. The share in the
property that would have been allotted
- 77 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 to the intestate on the basis of such a notional partition is governed by the
General Rules of Succession specified in Section 8, the HSA, 1956. The distribution of the property
among the Class I heirs is governed by the Rules specified in Section
10. In the distribution inter alia the surviving sons, daughters and mother of the intestate take one
share each and likewise the widow (and all the widows together if there was more than one) take one
share. In the distribution of the property of the deceased who has died intestate, a child who is
recognised as legitimate under sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the HMA, 1955 or under sub-section
(2) of Section 16 would be entitled to a share. Since this is the property that would fall to the share of
the intestate after notional partition, it belongs to the intestate. Under Section 16(3), a child
conferred with legitimacy is entitled to the property of their parents only, and does not have any
rights to or in the property of a person other than the parents. Hence, where the deceased has died
intestate, the devolution of this property must be among the children -- legitimate as well as those
conferred with legitimacy by the legislature under Sections 16(1) and 16(2) of the HMA, 1955. Doing
so would not offend or breach the restriction which is specified in sub-section (3) of Section 16.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 44
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
62. Sub-section (3) of Section 6 indicates by a deeming provision what would constitute the interest
of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener. As already discussed, the deeming fiction requires an
assumption of a hypothetical state of affairs in terms of which a notional partition is deemed to have
taken place immediately before the death of the Hindu Mitakshara coparcener.
- 78 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 62.1. Now, let us assume for the sake of example that there are four
coparceners -- C1, C2, C3, and C4. C2 has died. C2 is survived by a widow, a son, and a daughter but
it so transpires that one of the children is born from a marriage which is null and void under Section
11 of the HMA, 1955. C2 would have a 1/4th share in the coparcenary which consisted of him and his
three brothers -- C1, C3 and C4. Now, in order to ascertain C2's share in the property and the
devolution of this shares among C2's heirs, the Explanation mandates an assumption that a
partition took place immediately before C2's death. In such a partition, between him and his
brothers, C2 gets 1/4th share in the larger coparcenary comprising himself and his 3 brothers. Now,
within his own branch, C2, his widow and his child born from a valid marriage would each have a
1/3rd share. In other words, in the notional partition which is deemed to have taken place in terms
of the Explanation the share of C2 is ascertained at 1/3rd.
62.2. In working out the devolution of interest and the distribution of property following the death
of C2, C2's 1/3rd share would be equally distributed between his widow, child born from the
marriage which was valid and the child born from the marriage whose legitimacy is protected by
Section 16(1) of the HMA, 1955 though the marriage was null and void. In other words, such a child
would have a share in the property which would be allotted to his parent (C2) if a partition had
taken place immediately before the death of C2. The widow would take a 1/3rd share (her share in
the notional partition) plus 1/3rd in the 1/3rd share of C2 (her share in succession, as an heir to C2).
The child who was born from the valid marriage would acquire a 1/3rd share plus a 1/3rd share in
C2's 1/3rd share. The
- 79 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 child who has the benefit of Section 16(1) of the HMA, 1955 acquires a 1/3rd
share in the 1/3rd share which was allotted to C2 presuming that the partition had taken place
immediately before the death of C2. This child, unlike the child born from a lawful marriage, is not
entitled to a share in the notional partition itself. After the father's share is determined in such
notional partition, a child whose legitimacy is protected under Sections 16(1) and 16(2) will have a
share in the father's share, along with the surviving widow and the other children. This, in our view,
would be the correct and proper interpretation of the Explanation to Section 6 which mandates the
assumption of a notional state of affairs, namely, a partition immediately before the death of the
Hindu male coparcener.
63. It has been submitted before us that the child who is conferred with legitimacy under Section
16(1) and Section 16(2), would not have a share in the partition of the "larger coparcenary" but
would have a share in the coparcenary that comprises of the child's father and the father's legitimate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 45
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
children. It has been urged that in the latter coparcenary, this child would be on a par with the other
children of the father born from a valid marriage, and that such parity of treatment for the purpose
of coparcenary property is the purpose of the law [ Written synopsis on behalf of the appellant in
Revanasiddappa v. Mallikarjun, (2011) 11 SCC 1 :
(2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 581 by Kiran Suri, Senior Advocate, p. 4.] .
64. We must clarify that it is true that the Hindu law recognises a branch of the family as a
subordinate corporate entity, within the fold of the larger coparcenary comprising many such
branches.
- 80 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 However, even such branches can acquire, hold and dispose of family
property subject to certain limitations. The nature of property held by such a branch, until
partitioned among the members of the branch does not cease to be that of a joint family property of
all the coparceners of the branch. Now, since the child conferred with legitimacy under Section 16 is
not a coparcener, the branch comprises the father and his children born from the valid marriage. As
such, the property, once partitioned from the larger coparcenary, and in the hands of the father, for
his own branch, is not the father's separate property, until the partition happens within the branch.
It continues to be the coparcenary property in which the children from his valid marriage have joint
ownership. Thus, in view of the restriction in Section 16(3), in this property--not being the exclusive
property of the father--a child covered by Sections 16(1) and 16(2) is not entitled. [Vineeta Sharma v.
Rakesh Sharma, (2020) 9 SCC 1 at p. 39, para 36 : (2021) 1 SCC (Civ) 119:"36. In Bhagwan Dayal v.
Reoti Devi, 1961 SCC OnLine SC 52 : AIR 1962 SC 287, it was held that coparcenary is a creature of
law and branch of the family was a subordinate corporate body and discussed the proposition thus :
(AIR p. 304, para
47)'47. ... Coparcenary is a creature of Hindu law and cannot be created by agreement of parties
except in the case of reunion. It is a corporate body or a family unit. The law also recognises a
branch of the family as a subordinate corporate body. The said family unit, whether the larger one or
the subordinate one, can acquire, hold and dispose of family property subject to the limitations laid
down by law. Ordinarily, the manager, or by consent, express or implied, of the members of the
family, any other member or members can carry on business or

on behalf of the family. Such business or property would be the business or property of the family.'
"(emphasis in original and supplied)]
65. The above legal position is supported by a conjoint reading of Section 6, HSA and Section 16,
HMA as well. It is important to notice that while Section 16(1) and Section 16(2) of the HMA confer
legitimacy on children from void or voidable marriages, sub-section (3) has circumscribed the extent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 46
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
of the right to or in property that would be enjoyed by a person who has statutorily been conferred
with legitimacy under sub-sections (1) and (2). Such an individual is not to possess any rights in or
to the property of any person other than the parents. Hence, in working out the share of such an
individual who is entitled to the benefit of the statutory conferment of legitimacy by the two sub-
sections of Section 16, it is important to ascertain what exactly is the property of the parent which
comes up for devolution by intestate succession under Section 6(3) of the HSA, 1956. Where the
parent is a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener, the Explanation mandates that his share in the property
has to be ascertained on the basis of a notional partition having taken place immediately before his
death. The share of the Hindu male coparcener which is ascertained on the basis of a notional
partition immediately before his death would be distributed among his heirs in terms of Section 10
of the HSA, 1956. The individual upon whom legitimacy has been conferred by Section 16(1) or
Section 16(2) of the HMA, 1955 would be entitled to a share in the property that would have been
allotted to their parent assuming a notional partition immediately
- 82 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 before the death of the parent. Such a construction would be in accordance
with Section 6(3) and would harmonise it with the provisions of Section 16(3) of the HMA, 1955.
66. We must also take note of the fact that the HMA, 1955 came into force with effect from 18-5-
1955. Section 16 as it was originally enacted, dealt with the conferment of the legitimacy of children
born from void or voidable marriages, as the case may be. The erstwhile provision had a proviso
which circumscribed the extent of the right in property of a child born from such a marriage. The
HSA, 1956 came into effect on 17-6-1956. Section 6 as it originally stood was substituted by Act 39 of
2005 with effect from 9-9-2005. While Section 4 gives overriding effect to the Act, clause (b) of
sub-section (1) indicates that this is with respect to any other law in force immediately before the
commencement of the Act applicable to Hindus, insofar as it is inconsistent with any of the
provisions of the HSA, 1956. There is no inconsistency between Section 16(3) of the HMA, 1955 and
Section 6(3) of the HSA, 1956 and both have to be harmonised in the manner which has been
indicated above. When Section 6 was incorporated in the text of the HSA, 1956 as it was originally
enacted, Parliament was aware of the pre- existing provisions of Section 16 of the HMA, 1955. When
Section 6 was substituted by Act 39 of 2005, Parliament was aware of the substitution of Section 16
of the HMA, 1955 by Act 68 of 1976 with effect from 27-5-1976.
67. At this stage, it would be material to take notice of the provisions of Section 3(j) of the HSA, 1956
which defines the expression "related" in the following terms:
- 83 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 "3. (j) "related" means related by legitimate kinship:
Provided that illegitimate children shall be deemed to be related to their mother and
to one another, and their legitimate descendants shall be deemed to be related to
them and to one another; and any word expressing relationship or denoting a relative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 47
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
shall be construed accordingly."
68. The proviso to Section 3(j) indicates that illegitimate children "shall be deemed to be related to
their mother and to one another". This provision will not come in the way of an individual who is
protected by Section 16(1) or (2) of the HMA, 1955 in seeking a share in the estate of his or her
parent in terms of Section 6(3) of the HSA in the manner which has been interpreted earlier in this
judgment. Once legitimacy has been conferred upon such an individual under sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the HMA, 1955, the proviso to Section 3(j) which deals with
"illegitimate children" ceases to apply to children covered under Section 16(1) and Section 16(2).
69. The interplay between the provisions of Section 16(3) of the HMA, 1955 and Section 6 of the
HSA, 1956 has been elaborately discussed in an illuminating judgment of a Division Bench of the
Bombay High Court in Shantaram Tukaram Patil v. Dagubai Tukaram Patil [Shantaram Tukaram
Patil v. Dagubai Tukaram Patil, 1987 SCC OnLine Bom 9 : 1987 Mah LJ 179] . R.A. Jahagirdar, J.
speaking for the Division Bench observed : (SCC OnLine Bom para 21) "21. ... We have already held
above that the legitimacy conferred by Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act was there even prior to
the
- 84 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 1976 Amendment. Only it was extended to some more persons. The Hindu
Succession Act is no doubt an Act which is later to the Hindu Marriage Act. One must proceed on
the assumption that Parliament was aware of the provisions contained in Section 16 of the Hindu
Marriage Act -- an earlier law -- and despite this it did not exclude the children who were made
legitimate under Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act from the class of legitimate heirs under the
Hindu Succession Act. In fact one would assume that if Parliament wanted to exclude the
"legitimate children" of Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act from the provisions of the Hindu
Succession Act, it would have definitely provided for that effect. The legitimacy, therefore, created
by Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act must be read into as a part of the definition in Section 3(j)
of the Hindu Succession Act. It would be unreasonable to suppose that Section 3(j) would nullify the
effect of a provision contained in an earlier Act when either by express words or by necessary
implication it does not do so."
The Division Bench held that children born of a void marriage and who are regarded as legitimate by
virtue of the provisions of Section 16 of the HMA are entitled to the rights conferred upon them by
Section 16(3) "irrespective of the apparent restricted definition of Section 3(j) of the Hindu
Succession Act".
50. As such, the division said to have taken place in the year 1972, could not have been a proper and
valid division and it cannot be construed neither as a partition

G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 along the sharers of the joint family nor as a family settlement as is
contended by the plaintiffs.
51. In other words, the very claim of the plaintiffs being based on the partition that has taken place
in the year 1972, the right of the plaintiffs in seeking 1/5th share in respect of suit properties cannot
be countenanced as to law.
52. What is applicable to the plaintiffs would be equally applicable to defendant Nos.1 to 6.
Defendant Nos.1 to 3 are the appellants before this Court and therefore, they cannot maintain a
defence that they have succeeded to the property and they have divided the suit item Nos.1 to 5,
subsequent to the year 1972, 1981, 1983, 1988 and 1993 as they had no right to deal with those
properties in the manner they have dealt with. In other words, very frame of the suit of the plaintiffs
is incorrect.
- 86 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
53. In view of the foregoing discussions, as there could not have been any partition between the
children of first wife and children of second wife of Patel Rudrappa on 30.08.1972, by not making
the parties to the partition of all the sharers of the joint family, it is to be held that Ex.P.1 cannot be
construed as partition deed granting share to plaintiffs and defendants.
54. Resultantly, if the very partition deed dated 30.08.1972 cannot be construed as partition
between the children of first wife and the children of second wife of Patel Rudrappa, the only
remedy for the plaintiffs is to file a proper suit for the partition, impleading all the children of Patel
Rudrappa as parties to the suit and seek their respective shares in the light of principle of law
enunciated by the coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Kenchegowda Vs. K.B.Krishnappa
reported in ILR 2008 KAR 3453 and the principles of law enunciated by Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of
- 87 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953 Revanasiddappa Vs. Mallikarjun reported in 2023 SCC Online SC 1087 as
referred to supra.
55. It is at this stage that both plaintiffs and defendants submit that there is no dispute with regard
to the partition that has taken place between the children of first wife and children of second wife.
The children of first wife have never interfered with the possession and enjoyment of the suit
properties. If it is so, it was always open for the plaintiffs to make the children of first wife as
proforma defendants and proceeded with the suit. If the registered partition deed dated 30.08.1972,
did not settle the rights of the plaintiffs and defendants, as defendant Nos.1 to 3 have categorically
disputed the partition deed dated 30.08.1972, the trial Court ought not to have held issue No.1 in the
'affirmative' and should not have recorded that the suit properties are the joint family properties of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31084243/ 49
G R Somashekharappa S/O Late Patel ... vs A Gurushantappa on 28 November, 2023
plaintiffs and defendants, by virtue of the partition deed dated 30.08.1972.
- 88 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
56. When the very basis of the claim of the plaintiffs losses its significance in holding that partition
deed dated 30.08.1972 marked at Ex.P.1 did not settle the rights of plaintiffs and defendants,
besides being the children of first wife, suit ought not to have been decreed by the trial Court.
57. In view of the foregoing discussions, this Court does not find it necessary to discuss other aspects
of the matter. The decisions relied on by the parties as referred to supra would no doubt enunciate
the correct and proper legal principles. But peculiar facts of the present case especially, the
registered partition deed dated 30.08.1972 marked at Ex.P.1 did not settle the rights of the sharers,
the principle of law enunciated in the decisions relied on by the parties would not improve the case
of the parties and would not advance the cause of the parties to any extent further. As such, detailed
discussion on those decisions are not made in this judgment.
- 89 -
NC: 2023:KHC:42953
58. Accordingly, point Nos.1, 3 and 5 are answered in the negative and point Nos.2 and 4 would not
survive for consideration.
REG.POINT NO.6:
59. In view of the findings of this Court on above point Nos.1 to 5 as above, following:
ORDER i. Appeal is allowed.
ii. Impugned judgment and decree passed in O.S.NO.648/2000, dated 30.06.2005 is
hereby set aside.
iii. Suit is dismissed.
iv. The dismissal of the suit would not come in the way of parties to workout their
remedy in a duly constituted suit in accordance with law.
v. Admissions made by the parties in the present suit shall not be allowed to be
withdrawn in the intended suit.
