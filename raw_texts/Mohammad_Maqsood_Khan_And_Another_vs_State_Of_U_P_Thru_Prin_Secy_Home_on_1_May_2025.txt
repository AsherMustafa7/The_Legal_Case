It appears that on the basis of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the applicants, this
Court vide its order dated 11.08.2023 referred the matter to Mediation Centre of this Court so as to
carve out possibility of amicable settlement of dispute between the parties. The same is quoted
hereinbelow:-
"Heard learned counsel for the applicants, Shri Anirudh Kumar Singh, learned
A.G.A.-I for the State and perused the record.
Instant application under section 482 Cr.P.C. has been filed with the prayer to
quash/aside the impugned summoning order dated 08-05-2023, passed by the Civil

whole proceedings of FIR No. 0023 of 2023, Police Station-Mahila Thana,
District-Bahraich, pending in the court of Civil Judge(Junior
Division)/FTC(Women), Bahraich.
Learned counsel appearing for the applicants submits that this is purely a dispute
civil in nature as there is a matrimonial dispute between the husband and the wife
and due to which the instant FIR has been lodged and criminal proceedings have
been initiated against the applicants. He further added that there is all possibility of
compromise between the parties and this matter may be referred to Mediation and
Conciliation Centre of this Court.

It also appears that in compliance of order of this Court dated 11.08.2023, the applicant no. 1 and
respondent no. 2 had appeared before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre of this Court and a
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT has entered into between applicant/husband and opposite party No.

Principal Secretary and others (2014) 2 SCC 532 and Supreme Court Bar Association Vs. Union of
India (1998) 4 SCC 409, according to which, in given facts, based upon the settlement entered into
between the parties before the Mediation and Conciliation Center of this Court, the criminal
proceedings can be quashed, as also the nature of dispute/crime, this Court is of the view that the
present application is liable to be allowed as chances of ultimate conviction are extremely bleak and
hence no useful purpose would be served by allowing the criminal proceedings to continue.
Accordingly, present application is allowed. Consequently, the entire proceedings, quoted above, are
hereby quashed as far as it is related to the the applicant.
Office/Registry is directed to send the copy of this order to the court concerned through email/fax
for necessary compliance.
