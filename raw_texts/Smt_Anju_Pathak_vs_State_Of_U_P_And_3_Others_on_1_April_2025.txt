394, 34, 302 and 411 of Indian Penal Code, arising out of Case Crime No. 196 of 2013
under Section 302, 394, 411 of Indian Penal Code and 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station
Kotwali, District-Jaunpur,, pending before him and decide the same on day to day
hearing basis, within stipulated time as this Hon'ble Court may specify, and also pass
any other. and further order, which the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and just in the
circumstances and facts of the case."
4. Record shows that in respect of an incident, which is alleged to have occurred on 25/26.09.2013,
a prompt FIR dated 26.09.2013 was lodged by first informant-applicant and was registered as Case
Crime No. 0196 of 2013, under Sections 302, 394, 411 IPC and Sections 3/25 Arms Act, Police
Station-Kotwali, District-Jaunpur. In the aforesaid FIR, three persons namely (1) Sons of Late
Anand Kumar Pathak (Sons of Jeth of first informant), (2) Shera and (3) Shahnawaj have been
nominated as named accused.
5. After aforementioned FIR was lodged, Investigating Officer proceeded with statutory
investigation of concerned case crime number in terms of Chaper-XII Cr.P.C. On the basis of
material collected by him, during course of investigation, Investigating Officer came to the
conclusion that offence complained of is prima facie established. Consequently, he submitted the
charge sheet/police report dated 13.12.2013 in terms of Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. against three persons
i.e. (1) Shera (named in the FIR), (2) Narendra Kumar and (3) Bacha Lal Prajapati, two of the
accused i.e. Shera and Narendra Kumar were charge sheeted under Sections 302, 394, 411 IPC,
whereas one of the accused Bacha Lal Prajapati was charge sheeted under Sections 302, 394, 411
IPC and Sections 3/25 Arms Act.
6. Upon submission of aforementioned police report/charge sheet, cognizance was taken upon same
by the Jurisdictional Magistrate. However, as offence complained of is triable exclusively by the
Court of Sessions, therefore, the Jurisdictional Magistrate, committed the case to the Court of
Sessions. Resultantly, Sessions Trial No. 42 of 2014 (State Vs. Shera and Others), under Sections
under Sections 302, 394, 411 IPC, Police Station-Kotwali, District-Jaunpur came to be registered.
The concerned Sessions Judge proceeded with trial. He framed charges against charge sheeted
accused, vide framing of charge order dated 13.03.2014.
7. Subsequent to above order dated 13.03.2014, the trial procedure commenced. Prosecution in
discharge of it's burden to bring home the charges so framed against charge sheeted accused has
adduced only two witnesses up to this stage.
8. On the above premise, the learned counsel for applicant submits that the trial of charge sheeted
accused commenced in the year, 2014. However, in spite of the fact that a period of more than 10
years has rolled by, the trial of the accused has not yet concluded. The trial is not proceeding at the
required pace but to the contrary, at a snail's pace. As per the charge sheet, there are as many as 38
prosecution witnesses nominated therein. In view of the lackadaisical approach of Court below in
conducting the trial, there is no possibility of the trial getting concluded in near future. At this
juncture, the learned counsel for applicant invited the attention of Court to the order sheet and on
basis thereof, he submits that the case has been adjourned repeatedly either on the ground of non

presence of witnesses before Court below or adjournment/stay was prayed on behalf of accused,
which has been readily granted by Court below. On the above premise, it is thus urged by the
learned counsel for applicant that interest of justice shall be served, in case, a positive direction is
issued by this Court to Court below to proceed with aforementioned trial expeditiously without
granting any unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties, exemption to the accused and further
conclude the trial within a time period fixed by this Court.
8. Per contra, the learned A.G.A. for State-opposite party-1 has opposed the present application.
Referring to the observations made by Apex Court in paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Five Judges Bench
judgment in High Court Bar Association, Allahabad Vs. State of U.P. and Others, 2024 SCC Online
SC 207, the learned A.G.A. submits that no direction for time bound disposal of criminal trial can
now be issued by this Court. However, the Apex Court in aforementioned judgment has itself carved
out an exception that in case, exceptional circumstance exits, the Constitutional Court can direct for
time bound disposal of a criminal case. Referring to the affidavit filed in support of this application,
the learned A.G.A. submits that since no exceptional circumstance has emerged on record,
therefore, no indulgence be granted by this Court in present application.
9. Having heard the learned counsel for applicant, the learned A.G.A. for State and upon perusal of
record, this Court finds that no useful purpose shall be served in keeping this application pending.
10. Accordingly, this application is disposed of finally with a direction to Court below to proceed
with aforementioned Sessions Trial expeditiously without granting any unnecessary adjournment to
either of the parties, stay/exemption to accused except in exceptional circumstance and to take such
measure as are available under the Code (i.e. Cr.P.C.) to secure the presence of the witnesses and
further ensure strict compliance of the mandate of law provided in Section 309 Cr.P.C./Section 346
BNSS.
