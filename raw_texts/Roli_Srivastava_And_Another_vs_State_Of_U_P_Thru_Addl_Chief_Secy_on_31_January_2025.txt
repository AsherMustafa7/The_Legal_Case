6. Accordingly, benefit of judgment and order dated 04.07.2023, passed by this Court in Writ - A

petitioners herein. For the same of convenience, judgment and order dated 04.07.2023, is quoted
herein below :-
"1. Heard Shri Sanjay Misra, learned counsel for the petitioners and Shri Ashwani
Kumar Singh Rathore, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the
State-respondents.
2. The present petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed
seeking grade pay of Rs.2800/- as is being paid to other similarly placed Health
Workers, who were appointed on or before 01.12.2011.
3. The petitioners have been appointed after due selection on the post of Health
Worker (Male and Female) in the Health Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh.
Admittedly, they have been appointed after 01.12.2011. The petitioners are given
same pay scale of Rs.5200-20200/- as is being given to the Health Workers who were
appointed before 01.12.2011. The only difference is fixation of grade pay inasmuch as
the petitioners are being paid grade pay of Rs.2000/- whereas the similarly placed
Health Workers appointed on or before 01.12.2011 are being paid grade pay of
Rs.2800/-.
4. Shri Sanjay Misra, learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that paying
different grade pay to similarly appointed Health Workers on the ground of
difference in their dates of appointment is wholly discriminatory and is in violation of
Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. He further submits that the petitioners
are also entitled to be given the grade pay of Rs.2800/- as is being given to the
similarly placed Health Workers who were appointed on or before 01.12.2011.
5. Shri Ashwani Kumar Singh Rathore, learned Standing Counsel for the
State-respondents submits that the difference in grade pay is being given in
pursuance of the government order dated 19.12.2011 which provides that the Health
Workers appointed after 01.12.2011 would be given grade pay of Rs.2000/-. This
Court asked a specific question to learned Standing Counsel that what was the basis

Roli Srivastava And Another vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy. ... on 31 January, 2025
for paying different grade pay to the Health Workers appointed on or before
01.12.2011 and the Health Workers appointed after 01.12.2011? to which he fairly
submits that no reasoning is discernible in the government order except for cut of
date for fixing the grade pay of Rs.2000/- instead of Rs.2800/-.
6. This Court finds that the executive instructions of the government order is in
violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Government cannot
discriminate in the matter of payment of salary in respect of similarly appointed
Health Workers only on the basis of their dates of appointment.
7. In view thereof, the present petition is allowed. The respondents are directed to
pay grade pay of Rs.2800/- to the petitioners as is being paid to other similarly
placed Health Workers from the date of their appointment. The arrears should be
paid to the petitioners within a period of four months from today."
7. In view of the above, benefit of judgment and order dated 04.07.2023, passed by this Court in the
case of Kamal Deep Nirala and Others (supra), is also extended to the petitioners herein in same
terms.
8. Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed.
9. The respondents are directed to pay Grade Pay of Rs.2800/- to the petitioners as it has been paid
to the other similarly situated persons. The arrears thereof shall be paid to the petitioners within
next four months from today.
10. The petitioners are directed to provide a copy of this order alognwith copy of judgment and
order dated 04.07.2023 to the respondents for compliance of the directions issued by this Court.
