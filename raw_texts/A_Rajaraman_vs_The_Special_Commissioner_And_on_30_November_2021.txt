Again the said property was purchased by the petitioner by a registered sale deed dated 06.12.2006
vide document No.10397 of 2006. Further, by a sale deed dated 18.12.2009 registered vide

comprised in survey No.109/4 from the legal heirs of the deceased V.Mangammal and her husband.
The petitioner also purchased another extent of 1487 sq.ft comprised in survey No.109/4 from one
T.Joseph by a registered sale deed dated 27.12.2006 vide document No.11158 of 2006. Thus, the
petitioner became an absolute owner of the property to an extent of 23110 sq.ft of land comprised in
survey No.109/4, Ward No.1, Village No.31, Kodungaiyur Village, Thiruvottiyur (herein after called
the 'subject property').
4. Thereafter, the petitioner constructed a building and obtained https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
electricity connection and the subject property is also assessed to property tax. The petitioner is in
possession and enjoyment of the same. When the petitioner applied for patta for the subject
property, he was given to understand that the property comes under the Tamil Nadu Urban Land
(Ceiling and Regulations) Act, 1978 (herein after called the 'Act').
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the second respondent did not give any
notice to the owners of the subject land. The notice under Section 7(2) of the Act shall be served to
the land owner to file a statement under Section 7(1) of the Act. As per Section 9 of the Act, the
competent authority prepared a draft statement on the basis of the statement obtained under
Section 7 and served the draft statement to call for objections, after giving a reasonable opportunity
to the owners and pass orders as to declaration of surplus land. Thereafter, as per Section 10(1) of
the Act final statement shall be prepared after disposal of the objections to the draft statement and a
copy of the final statement should be served on the person where such vacant land is held under a
lease or a mortgage or a hire purchase agreement or an irrevocable power of attorney and also on
the owner of the land. However, the petitioner and his predecessors are in continuous possession
and enjoyment of the subject land. No notice had been served https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
either to erstwhile owner of the land or the petitioner. The petitioner is in possession and enjoyment
of the same and as such, the entire acquisition proceedings was lapsed, in view of Section 4 of the
Repealing Act 20 of 1999.
6. That apart, the petitioner or his predecessors were never served notice under Section 11(5) of the
Act to take possession of the subject property. If at all, the land owner denied the possession of the
property then the respondent ought to have invoked the provisions under Section 11(6) of the Act to
take force of possession. However, no notice had been served to take possession of the subject
property. He further submitted that even there is absolutely no whisper about the possession or the
predecessor or the title over the subject property. Therefore, the entire acquisition proceedings was
lapsed. In support of his contention he relied upon the following Judgments :
(i) 2012 (6) MLJ 273 in the case of Government of Tamil Nadu Vs. Mecca Prime
Tannery
(ii) The Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court passed in W.A.No.297 of 2011 dated

7. Per contra, the respondents filed a counter stating that the land comprised in survey No.109/4 to
an extent of 0.77 ½ cents and the land comprised in survey No.109/6 to an extent of 0.04 cents
originally owned by Neelammal and Mannarammal. They did not file any returns under Section 7(1)
of the Act. Hence, notice under Section 7(1) was issued on 30.08.1985. The said notice was served
with one P.S.Varadhan, who is the son of the urban land owner on 12.09.1985. Since no reply was
received from the urban land owner, a notice under Section 9(4) along with a statement under
Section 9(1) of the Act were issued on 18.12.1986, calling for objections, if any, for the proposed
acquisition of 2275 sq.mts of excess vacant land after allowing 1000
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sq.mts (150 sq.mt in survey No.109/6 and 850 sq.mt in survey

Section 11(3) of the Act was issued on 29.05.1991 and published in the Tamil Nadu Government

10. A perusal of the records reveals that though notice under Section 7(2) of the Act was issued in
the name of Neelambal and Mannarammal, the original urban land owners name found in the
revenue records as Neelambal and Mangammal. Admittedly, no notice had sent to the original
urban land owners. That apart, the said notices were received by one P.S.Varadhan on 12.09.1985.
Since no reply was received from the land owners, the notice under Section 9(4) along with a
statement under Section 9(1) of the Act were issued on 18.12.1986. The said notices were affixed on
07.06.1989. There is no record to show that the notices were sent by RPAD to the original land
owners. Subsequent notices such as under Sections 9(5), 10(1), 11(1) and 11(3) were also served only
by affixture. No notice was served on the urban land owners. Finally, the notice under Section 11(5)
of the Act was issued on 30.08.1991. There is absolutely no record to show that the said notices were
served on the urban land owners or interested persons who purchased the subject land. Even today,
the petitioner is in possession and enjoyment of the subject property by putting up building. The
said building was also assessed to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the house tax and obtained
electricity connection. In fact, the petitioner is regularly paying all dues to the revenue authorities
concerned. Thus, it is clear that the respondents had done only desk work, no physical possession
has been taken over even today.
11. Though the petitioner is a subsequent purchaser and the possession and enjoyment of the subject
land is still with the petitioner. In view of Section 4 of the Repealing Act 20 of 1999, if the physical
possession has not been taken over from the urban land owners or the interested persons, the entire
acquisition proceedings initiated under the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulations) Act
stands abated and liable to be declared as null and void. Admittedly, the petitioner is in possession
and enjoyment of the subject land. The provisions of the Tamil Nadu Urban Land (Ceiling and
Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, squarely comes to the benefit of the petitioner.
12. In view of the above, the entire acquisition proceedings have lapsed in respect of the lands
comprised in survey No.109/4 at Ward No.1, Village No.31, Kodungaiyur Village, measuring to an
extent of 23110 sq.ft. situate at No.13/2, Anna Salai, Kodungaiyur, Chennai 600 118. The third
respondent is directed to mutate the entire revenue records in respect of the subject lands in
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the name of the petitioner and issue patta in his favour, within a
period of six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
13. In the result, the writ petition stands allowed. No costs.
