For Appellants : Mrs.S.Srimathy,
Special Government Pleader
(in all the Writ Appeals)
For Respondent No.1 : Mr.S.Chellapandian
(in all the Writ Appeals)
COMMON JUDGMENT
(Judgment of the Court was delivered by M.SATHYANARAYANAN, J.) By consent, all the Writ
Appeals are taken together and are disposed of by this common judgment.
2. Mr.S.Chellapandian, learned Counsel, accepts notice on behalf of the first respondent.
3. Admittedly, the respondents/Writ petitioners are employed in the minority Schools and though
their appointment have been approved, they have not cleared Teachers Eligibility Test (TET)
examination and when the representations submitted on behalf of the educational institutions in

which they are employed, the third respondent vide impugned proceedings had directed the School
management to furnish the details, as to the passing of Teacher Eligibility Test by the private
respondents/Writ petitioners and aggrieved by the same, Writ petitions were filed.

4. The learned Single Judge had taken up all the Writ petitions together and disposed of the same
vide common order dated 26.02.2019 and it is relevant to extract the same hereunder:-
“3.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the learned Special
Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submitted that in similar
circumstances, this Court, by order, dated 26.07.2018 in W.P(MD)No.16428 of 2018,
at paragraph Nos.7 and 8 held as follows:-
“7.In this case also, the petitioner was appointed in the fourth respondent School,
which is admittedly a recognised minority aided School. The appointment also has
been made within the sanctioned strength and the petitioner claimed that, he is
having every qualification to hold the post. When that being the position, as no other
reason has been given in the impugned order, except the reason of TET qualification,
that too, citing the reason that, no guidelines given by the first respondent/Director
to the lower level approving authorities to approve such appointment without TET
qualification, this Court is of the firm view that the impugned order cannot be
sustained and it is liable to be quashed.
8.In the result:-
(i) the impugned order is quashed and the Writ Petition is allowed;
(ii) the matter is remitted back to the respondents, especially, the second respondent,
who shall pass necessary orders with regard to the grant of approval to the
petitioner's appointment, http://www.judis.nic.in W.A.(MD)Nos.791, 794, 795 and
796 of 2020 as no other impediment has been cited in the impugned order, except
the guidelines to be issued by the Director for making approval of the Teachers, who
have been appointed in the minority aided School without TET qualification;
(iii) Such orders of approval shall be passed within a period of four weeks from the
date of receipt of a copy of this order; and
(iv) It is needless to mention that, once the approval is given, the petitioner is entitled
to get all service and monetary benefits, as per the eligibility and the same shall also
be paid to the petitioner forthwith.”
5. The learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the appellants/official respondents would
submit that the fact remains that, the passing of Teacher Eligibility Test is for the benefit of students

The Director Of School Education vs Mrs.J.Prabha Vinothini. ... 1St on 9 September, 2020
for whom the education is important and therefore, it is obligatory on the part of the private
respondents/Writ petitioners to clear the same and the said aspect has not been taken into
consideration and it is also against the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Honourable
Supreme Court in T.M.A.Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors reported in LNIND
2002 SC 740.
6. Per contra, Mr.S.Chellapandian, learned Counsel appearing for the private respondents/Writ
petitioners would submit that in the light of yet another judgment of the Constitution Bench of the
Honourable Supreme Court http://www.judis.nic.in W.A.(MD)Nos.791, 794, 795 and 796 of 2020 in
Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust and others v. Union of India and others reported in 2014
(8) SCC 1 : 2014 4 MLJ 486, passing of Teacher Eligibility Test is not necessary in respect of
Teachers employed in minority institution, especially, religious minority institution and as such, the
common impugned order do not warrants interference.
7. This Court has carefully considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials placed
before it.
8. In Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust and others v. Union of India and others (cited supra),
the Honourable Supreme Court of India in paragraph No.46, observed that “In our view, if the 2009
Act is made applicable to minority schools, aided or unaided, the right of the minorities under
Article 30(1) of the Constitution will be abrogated. Therefore, the 2009 Act insofar it is made
applicable to minority schools referred in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution is ultra vires the
Constitution”. The said judgment has also been followed by this Court in various pronouncements.
9. In the light of the above cited legal position, grounds urged on behalf of the appellants lack
merits. In the result, all the Writ Appeals are http://www.judis.nic.in W.A.(MD)Nos.791, 794, 795
and 796 of 2020 dismissed, confirming the common order dated 26.02.2019 made in W.P.
(MD).Nos.2770, 2771, 2772 and 2773 of 2019. The appellants/official respondents are directed to
comply with the common order dated 26.02.2019, passed in W.P.(MD).Nos.2770, 2771, 2772 and
2773 of 2019, as confirmed in these Writ Appeals within a period of 12 (Twelve) weeks from the date
of receipt of a copy of this order and communicate the decision taken to the concerned educational
institutions. No costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.
