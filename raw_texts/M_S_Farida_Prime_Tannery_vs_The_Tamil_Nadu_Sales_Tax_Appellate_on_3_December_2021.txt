COMMON ORDER
(Order of the Court was made by MOHAMMED SHAFFIQ, J.) The petitioners herein, which are the
two different companies, have come up with these writ petitions challenging the orders passed by
the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chennai. Since the issues involved therein are
inter-connected and inter-twined, all the writ petitions are disposed of by this common order.
2.The brief facts leading to the filing of these writ petitions would run thus:
WP.Nos.20387/2004 and 30959 and 30960/2007 The petitioner is a registered
dealer in hides and skins under the provisions of the TNGST Act, 1959 and CST Act,
1956 on the file of the third https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis respondent. They are
engaged in the business of purchase of raw hides and skins and sale/export of the
same after tanning, besides undertaking the job works of tanning for both local and
other state dealers. For the assessment years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, the
petitioner filed their returns and claimed exemption under section 5(3) of the CST
Act, on the last purchases of raw hides and skins effected for export, after undergoing
the process of tanning, besides claiming exemption on the value of dyes and
chemicals utilised in the process of job works performed for local as well as other
state dealers. According to the petitioner, the dyes and chemicals being consumables,
were exempted from the levy of tax. The original assessments were completed by the
assessing officer / third respondent, rejecting the claim of the petitioner seeking
exemption under section 5(3) of the CST Act. Similarly, the assessing officer
disallowed the deduction claimed on the value of dyes and chemicals used in the
process of job work of tanning for local and other state dealers. Accordingly, the third
respondent levied tax on the entire sales turnover, besides levying penalty.
Challenging the same, the petitioner preferred first appeals to the Appellate Assistant
Commissioner (CT), Vellore / second respondent, who set aside the levy of tax on the
value of dyes and chemicals utilised in the job work for other state dealers, but
restored the order of the assessing officer in respect of the value of dyes and
chemicals utilised in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis the job work for local dealers.
The second respondent also granted the relief in relation to the last purchase of hides
and skins meant for export and granted exemption in respect of second sales
turnover leather, besides setting aside the corresponding penalty. Aggrieved against
the same, the State went on further appeals before the first respondent. The
petitioner filed cross objection challenging the turnover sustained by the first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 3
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
appellate authority. The Tribunal disposed of the appeals and cross objections, by
separate orders dated 23.12.2003 and 06.08.2007. Therefore, these writ petitions by
the assessee.
WP.No.36852 of 2006:
The petitioner is a registered dealer in hides and skins and also an exporter of the
finished leather. During the course of such business, he received purchase orders
from the foreign customer and therefore, placed orders on the local dealer for the
purchase of raw skins to comply with the said foreign export order. According to the
petitioner, in view of section 14 r/w section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, the
purchase of raw skins are exempted from payment of tax, if they are purchased
pursuant to the foreign export order. They filed its returns for the assessment year
1991-92 disclosing the last purchase of raw skins pursuant to the export order as
exempted in view of section 5(3) of the Central Sales Tax Act. It is the further case of
the petitioner https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis that the respondents are not at all
empowered to treat the raw and the finished hides and skins as two different
commodities to visit the petitioner with liability under the Central Sales Tax Act.
However, the first respondent rejected the plea and passed the order of assessment
dated 31.08.1995 imposing tax on the last purchase of raw hides and skins treating it
as different commodities. Challenging the same, the petitioner filed an appeal before
the Appellate Assistant commissioner in AP No.1419 of 1995, which was allowed in
favour of the petitioner by order dated 18.09.1997. However, the State went on
further appeal before the second respondent on the ground that the raw hides and
skins are different and the petitioner has to satisfy the ingredient of section 5(3) to
claim exemption. However, the second respondent rejected the contention of the
petitioner and allowed the appeal by order dated 19.12.2003. As against the said
order, the petitioner preferred tax case before the Tamil Nadu Taxation Special
Tribunal and the same was returned and represented before this court, in view of the
abolition of the Special Tribunal by Act 32/2004. Therefore, this writ petition.
3.Thus, the questions that arise for consideration in these writ petitions are viz.,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
(i). Whether the petitioners are entitled to claim the benefit of section 5(3) of the Central Sales Tax
Act,1956 (hereinafter referred to as “CST Act, 1956”) in respect of purchase of raw hides and skins
which are being converted to dressed hides and skins before exported?
(ii). Whether the dyes and chemicals used in the execution of works contract of tanning are liable to
tax under Section 3B of the TNGST Act, 1959?
Question No.1
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 4
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
4.According to the respondents / revenue, for a sale/ purchase to fall within the ambit of section
5(3) of CST Act,1956, the penultimate sale/ purchase preceding the export and the actual export
must be of the very “same goods”. The goods on which the exemption is claimed under section 5(3)
of the CST Act, 1956 are raw hides and skins, while the goods exported being dressed hides and
skins, which are commercially different. Therefore, the petitioners' claim under Section 5(3) of the
CST Act, 1956 is unsustainable. In support of the same, the learned Special Government Pleader
appearing for the respondents placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of K.A.K. Anwar & Co Vs The state of TN reported in (1998) 108 STC 258 ( SC) wherein it was
held that “the raw https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis hides and skins are commercially different from
dressed hides and skins”. The relevant paragraph reads as follows:
“The words “ hides and skins, whether is a raw or dressed state” in a Section 14(iii) of
the Central Sales Tax Act clearly seem to indicate that the legislature recognised that
raw hides and skins was an item different from dressed hides and skins, As has
already been noticed herein above it is after undergoing a manufacturing process
involving various stages that raw hides and skins becomes dressed hides and
skins.........In the present case dressed hides and skins in a separate commercial
commodity which emerges after hides and skins has been subjected to manufacturing
process and therefore, Section 14(iii) deals with two different types of goods which
unlike the case of pulses referred to in Section 15(d), is not regarded by the Act as one
and the same commodity.” A reading of the above decision would clearly demonstrate
that raw hides and skins, which are the subject matter of the penultimate
sale/purchase, in respect of which the benefit under Section 5(3) of CST Act, 1956 is
claimed, are commercially different from that of dressed hides and skins, which
emerge after they are subjected to various manufacturing processes before being
exported. It is thus contended by the learned counsel for the revenue that as the
penultimate sale/purchase and the goods that are actually exported, are
commercially different, the same would go out of the sweep of Section 5(3) of the CST
Act, 1956 and the petitioners are not entitled to the benefit of section 5(3) of the CST
Act, 1956.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
5.The relevancy and applicability of the “same goods” theory, while examining a claim under Section
5(3) of CST Act, 1956, came up for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and stood
resolved by the Constitutional Bench in the case of State of Karnataka Vs Azad Coach Builders
Private Limited and Another reported in (2010) 9 Supreme Court Cases 524. Before the issue was
decided by the Constitutional Bench, the matter was referred by a Division Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court which felt that the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sterling Foods and
Vijayalakshmi Cashew Co., reported in (1986) 3 SCC 469 needs a fresh look, in the light of the later
judgment of the Supreme Court in K. Gopinathan Nair and hence, the matter was referred to a
larger bench. The larger bench thereafter placed the matter before the Constitutional Bench.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 5
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
6.The Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Karnataka Vs Azad
Coach Builders Private Limited and Another reported in (2010) 9 Supreme Court Cases 524 ,
considered the claim of an assesee, who had effected sales of bus bodies to an exporter, who had
exported completed buses to foreign buyers. Importantly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court found, as a
matter of fact, that the assessee therein by name M/s. Azad Coach Builders was requested to build
bus bodies by the exporter, Tata Engineering https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Locomotive Co., Ltd
in accordance with the specifications provided by the foreign buyers, Lanka Ashok Leyland Ltd.,
Colombo. It was found that the specimen copy of the purchase order dated 11.07.1988 placed on the
assessee by the exporter revealed that the assessee therein was asked to fabricate bus bodies on the
chassis supplied by the exporter in accordance with the specifications given by the foreign buyer. In
one of the communications received from the foreign buyer, it was stipulated that the steel and
aluminum panels of the bus bodies be built by M/s.Azad Coach Builders, since the customers in Sri
Lanka preferred them. M/s.Azad Coach Builders accordingly manufactured the bus bodies, in
accordance with the specifications stipulated by the foreign buyer and mounted the same on the
chassis made available by the exporter making it as a complete bus ready for export. It was urged
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court that to claim the benefit under Section 5(3) of the CST Act,1956,
it is essential that the goods sold/purchased under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956 and the goods
actually exported must retain the commercial identity. This submission was made on the basis of
what was called as “same goods” theory, which was applied by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Sterling Foods vs. State of Karnataka reported in (1986) 3 SCC 469 and in the case of
Vijayalakshmi Cashew Co. vs. CTO reported in (1996) 1 SCC 468.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
7.The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sterling foods, while examining the claim of exemption
under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956, in respect of purchase of prawns, shrimps and lobsters,
which were exported after removal of heads and tails, peeling, deveining and cleaning etc., held that
even after the prawns are subject to the above process, it retained its commercial identity and
therefore, was entitled to the benefit under section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Vijayalaxmi Cashew Co., while examining the question as to whether the cashew
kernels obtained out of raw cashew nuts would be entitled to the benefit of section 5(3) of the CST
Act,1956, held that the cashew kernels which was exported was commercially different from raw
cashew nuts purchased and thus, would not be entitled to the benefit of section 5(3) of the CST Act.
8.The Constitutional Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Karnataka vs. Azad
Coach Builders Private Limited and another reported in (2010) 9 SCC 524, on analyzing the above
decisions, in the light of the Statement of objects and reasons of the amended Act 103 of 1976
introducing Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956, observed as follows:-
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis • To constitute a sale in the course of export there
must be an intention on the part of both the buyer and the seller to export.
• There must be obligation to export and there must be an actual export.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 6
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
• The obligation may arise by reason of statute, contract between the parties, or from
mutual understanding or agreement between them, or even from the nature of the
transaction which links the sale to export.
To occasion export there must exist such a bond between the contract of sale and the
actual exportation, that each link is inextricably connected with the one immediately
preceding it, without which a transaction sale cannot be called a sale in the course of
export of goods out of the territory of India.
"27.“The phrase” sale in the course of export comprises in itself three essentials (i)
that there must be a sale (ii) that goods must actually be exported and (iii) that the
sale must be a part and parcel of the export. The word “occasion” is used as verb and
means “to cause" or “to be the immediate cause of”. Therefore, the words
“occasioning the export” mean the factors, which were the immediate cause of export.
The words “to comply with the agreement or order" mean all transactions which are
inextricably linked with the agreement or order occasioning that export. The
expression "in relation to" are words of comprehensiveness, which might both have a
direct significance as well as an https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis indirect
significance, depending on the context in which it is used and they are not words of
restrictive content and ought not be so construed. Therefore, the test to be applied is,
whether there is is an inseverable link between the local sale or purchase and export
and if it is clear that the local sale or purchase between the parties is inextricably
linked with the export of the goods, then a claim under Section 5(3) for exemption
from State sales tax is justified, in which case, the same goods theory has no
application.
(Emphasis supplied) Thus, the above decision of the Constitutional Bench of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court would show that to claim the benefit under Section 5(3) of
the CST Act, 1956, an enquiry has to be conducted to ascertain whether there exist
such a bond between the penultimate sale/purchase and the actual export that both
transactions are inextricably connected. There must be an inseverable link between
the sale/purchase claimed to be under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956 and the
actual export. If an assessee is able to demonstrate the existence of such an
inextricable link, then the “same goods” theory would not apply while examining a
claim under section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956.
9.Such being the position of law, we find that the Tribunal has accepted the case of the revenue only
on the premise that raw hides and skins are https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis commercially
different and therefore, the benefit under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956 cannot be extended.
However, subsequent to the decision of the Tribunal, the Constitutional Bench of Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of Karnataka Vs Azad Coach Builders Private Limited and Another
reported in (2010) 9 SCC 524 has held that the benefit of Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956, cannot
be denied on the ground that the goods purchased and the goods exported were different. In other
words, if there exist an inseverable link between the local sale/ purchase and export and it is clear
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 7
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
that both are inextricably connected, then the benefit under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956 cannot
be disallowed applying the “same goods” theory. As stated earlier, the Tribunal had not made any
enquiry as to whether the goods purchased and exported in respect of which the benefit of section
5(3) of the CST Act, 1956 claimed, are inextricably connected with the actual export. Such enquiry is
essential to decide the claim of the petitioners under Section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956.
10.Therefore, the orders of the Tribunal are set aside to that extent and the matters are remanded
back to the Assessing Officer for passing fresh orders, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the
petitioners and permitting them to lead requisite evidence to establish such inextricable link
between the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis sale/purchase of the raw hides and skins in question
and the export of dressed hides and skins by the petitioners, keeping in view the law laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of Karnataka Vs Azad Coach Builders Private
Limited and Another reported in (2010) 9 SCC 524. The first question raised in all the writ petitions
is decided accordingly. Question No.2
11.This question, as to whether the dyes and chemicals used in the execution of works contract of
tanning are liable to tax under Section 3B of TNGST, 1959, raised for determination only in the writ
petition bearing Nos.20387/2004 and 30959 and 30960/2007 filed by M/s.Farida Prime Tannery,
Thuthipet. In the orders which are impugned herein, the Tribunal held that the dyes and chemicals
used in the process of tanning leather are liable to tax, in view of Section 3B of TNGST Act, 1959.
The said order has been challenged by the petitioner on the ground that the dyes and chemicals are
consumables and getting washed away and thus, there is no transfer of property in the dyes and
chemicals used in the process of tanning.
12.The above issue now stands resolved by the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Unique traders
vs. Commercial Tax Officer reported in 2020 (19) GSTR 48, 2020 (5) CTC 68 wherein the following
question was framed:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis “whether the purchase of ink for printing polythene
rolls is taxable in terms of Section 3-B of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959
/ Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act.”
13. The Full Bench noticed the divergent views expressed by this Court, after referring to the
decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Tamil Nadu, rep. by the Deputy
Commissioner (Commercial Taxes), Salem Tax Vs. Tvl.S.S.M.Processing Mills,Case (Revision)
Nos.69 of 2009, 80 and 81 of 2011, wherein it was held that “there is transfer of property in dyes and
chemicals used in the works contract of bleaching”. As could be seen from the paragraph 43 of the
full bench decision, after extracting the observation of the Division Bench in the case of
S.S.M.Processing Mills, the Full Bench affirmed the same at paragraph 57 in affirmative. The
relevant portion of the Division Bench judgment reads as under:
“The fact that the chemicals used for bleaching is washed away in the process, by
itself, would not be a justifiable ground to accept the case of the assessee that there
was no transfer of property of any goods. The very fact of the yarn being bleached by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3245732/ 8
M/S Farida Prime Tannery vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 3 December, 2021
a chemical process, by applying the chemical, will clearly point out that there is
transfer of property of the chemical, hence, bleaching contract attracts sales tax as in
the case of dyeing contract, when the chemicals are purchased from outside the state.
Consequently, this Court allow the Tax Case (Revisions)
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis filed by the state.” The Full Bench affirmed the
above decision in the case of SSM Processing Mills, as would be clear from the
following:
“The learned Single Judge whose order is under appeal before us has applied the
correct position of law by relying on Tvl.S.S.M. Processing Mills, (referred supra),
and on the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court in Enviro Chemicals v. State of
Kerala.(referred supra).” Thereafter, the Full Bench proceeded to conclude that dyes
used in printing is exigible to tax. The following portion of decision is relevant:-
“The correct position of law as repeatedly and consistently pointed out by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, finally in (2015) 78 VST 451 (SC), State of Karnataka Vs Pro Lab &
Ors, is “to sum up, it follows from the reading of the aforesaid judgment that after
insertion of clause 29-A in Article 366, the Works Contract which was indivisible one
by legal fiction, altered into a contract, is permitted to be bifurcated into two: one for
"sale of goods" and other for "services", thereby making goods component of the
contract exigible to sales tax. Further, while going into this exercise of divisibility,
dominant intention behind such a contract, namely, whether it was for sale of goods
or for services, is rendered otiose or immaterial. It follows, as a sequitur, that by
virtue of clause 29-A of Article 366, the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis State
Legislature is now empowered to segregate the goods part of the Works Contract and
impose sales tax thereupon. It may be noted that Entry 54, List II of the Constitution
of India empowers the State Legislature to enact a law taxing sale of goods. Sales tax,
being a subject-matter into the State List, the State Legislature has the competency to
legislate over the subject.” Accordingly, the Full Bench of this Court answered the
reference in favour of the Revenue, holding that the purchase of ink for printing is
eligible to tax in terms of Section 3-B of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act,1959.
14.Thus, the question, as to whether the dyes and chemicals used in the execution of
works contract including tanning are liable to tax, is answered in favour of the
Revenue, beyond pale of any doubt in view of the decision of the Full Bench as
referred to above. In view of the same, the orders of the Tribunal impugned in
WP.Nos.20387/2004 and 30959 and 30960/2007 insofar as it relates to levy of tax
of dyes and chemicals used in the execution of works contract including tanning,
stand confirmed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
15.In fine, all the writ petitions are partly allowed to the extent as indicated in paragraph 10 of this
order, as regards the exemption claimed by the petitioners under section 5(3) of the CST Act, 1956.
