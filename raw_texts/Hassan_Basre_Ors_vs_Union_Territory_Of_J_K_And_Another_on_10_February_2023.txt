mandate of Talaq-e-Hassan to respondent No.2 on 20.02.2018 but due to the intervention of elder
family members of both the parties the issues between the two was reconciled and the said Talaq
was never acted upon; that respondent No.2 thereafter refused to stay at her matrimonial home and
threatened her husband that he had to choose either her or his parents. Consequently, the parents of
the petitioner in order to save the matrimonial knot and seeing the constant harassment of their son
at the hands of respondent No.2, separate provisions were made at the ground floor of the house so
that the issues between them may be amicably resolved/settled; that not only the brother of the
petitioner but the whole family tried their levelbest to save this matrimonial knot but the hostile and
adamant behavior of respondent No.2 towards her husband as well as with the old aged parents of
the petitioner took an ugly turn when the petitioner on 26.06.2020 was visiting her paternal home

with her family members started threatening and abusing them and not only verbal but physical
assault was also done by the family members of respondent No.2; that constrained by the criminal

members at Police Station, Rajouri on 18.08.2020; that in order to shield their criminal
acts,respondent No.2 with mala-fide intention filed a false and frivolous complaint as a counterblast
before Police post, City Rajouri on the very next date i.e 27.06.2020;
It has been stated in the petition that the petitioner is a physical Education Teacher posted at Govt.

Rajouri lodged by the brother of the petitioner against respondent No.2 under Sections 341, 323,
504, 427, 382 of IPC and the same is nothing but gross abuse and misuse of the process of law and
an attempt to victimize the innocent petitioner and his family members time and again in one
frivolous complaints or other; that the said Hassan Basre was always estranged towards the brother
of the petitioner after the marriage and only after few weeks, started harassing by filing numerous
frivolous claims, suit and criminal complaints against her in-laws at that point of time which cannot
be narrated in detail in the instant petition for the sake of brevity and keeping in mind the very
purpose of the instant petition and now respondent No.2 at the behest of her sister and owing to her
matrimonial issues once again is making another false and frivolous complaint to harass and
victimize the petitioner and his family members to settle the scores while misusing the law; that
during pendency of all these petitions a compromise was arrived at between the petitioners and the

have entered into a compromise and also sought time to file compromise deed before the Court with
liberty to the parties to record their statements before the Registrar Judicial of this Court. In this
regard, the Registrar Judicial has recorded the statements of both the petitioners, the same are
placed on record which read as under:-
Statement of Abdul Majeed Wani (respondent No.2 in CRM(M) No. 246/2020), Age:
78 years; S/o Mohd. Abdullah R/o H. No. 6, Wani Market, Ward No. 8, Rajouri on
oath today i.e 19.12.2022;
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with all the petitioners

22.10.2022, duly registered and attested on 09.11.2022 by Notary Public Rajouri, has
also been executed between my son-Tahir Iqbal Wani and Hassan Basre (petitioner
No.1). Further, I have no grievance against the petitioners. In view of our
compromise, I have no objection in case Hon'ble Court quashes FIR No. 428/2020
dated 18.08.2020 lodged at Police Station Rajouri against the petitioners for
commission of offences under Sections 452, 382, 323, 147, 504 and 506 IPC.
Statement of Hassan Basre (respondent No.2 in CRM(M) No. 271/2020), Age:35;
D/o Mohd. Rafiq Mir R/o A/p Ward No.8, Near Zabah Khana, Rajouri on oath today
i.e. 19.12.2022:
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with Shazia Wani
[petitioner in CRM(M) No. 271/2020] and other persons mentioned in the FIR No.
410/2020 dated 08.08.2020 lodged at Police Station Rajouri. A deed of divorce by
mutual consent/Mubarat dated 22.10.2022, duly registered and attested on
09.11.2022 by Notary Public Rajouri, has also been executed between brother of
petitioner-Tahir Iqbal Wani and me. Further, I have no grievance against the
petitioner and other persons mentioned in the FIR. In view of our compromise, I
have no objection in case Hon'ble Court quashes FIR No. 410/2020 dated
08.08.2020 lodged at Police Station Rajouri for commission of offences under
Sections 498-A and 109 IPC.
5. Bare perusal of the statements of petitioners placed on record demonstrates that the parties have
entered into a compromise whereby they have settled their differences.
6. The Apex Court in the case of B. S. Joshi & others Vs State of Haryana and another, reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 675 while discussing the ambit and scope of inherent powers of High Courts under
Section 482 CPC in paras 1, 14, 15 and 16 held as under :
"1. The question that falls for determination in the instant case is about the ambit of
the inherent powers of the High Courts under Section 482, Code of Criminal
Procedure (Code) read with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to
quash criminal proceedings. The scope and ambit of power under Section 482 has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128016671/ 4
Hassan Basre & Ors vs Union Territory Of J&K And Another on 10 February, 2023
been examined by this Court in catena of earlier decisions but in the present case that
is required to be considered in relation to matrimonial disputes. The matrimonial
disputes of the kind in the present case have been on considerable increase in recent
times resulting in filing of complaints by the wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC
not only against the husband but his other family members also. When such matters
are resolved either by wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or mutual
separation of husband and wife and also mutual settlement of other pending disputes
as a result whereof both sides approach the High Court and jointly pray for quashing
of the criminal proceedings or the First Information Report or complaint filed by the
wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC, can the prayer be declined on the ground
that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code and,
therefore, it is not permissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR
or complaint.
14. There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section
498A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband
or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a
husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives
to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be
counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object
for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of
inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent
women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal
Code.
15. In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section
320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.
16. For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment and allow the
appeal and quash the FIR above mentioned."
7. The ratio of judgment of B. S. Joshi's case (supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear
that the High Court has inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice if the parties have settled their disputes amicably
by a compromise. The ratio of judgments (supra) is clearly applicable to the case in hand.
8. In the case in hand the parties have arrived at a compromise, so there would be no chance of
conviction in near future in case trial is held and concluded.
9. In view of the above, these petitions stand allowed.
10. Consequently, FIR No.428/2020 dated 18.08.2020, registered at Police Station, Rajouri against
the petitioners under Sections 452, 382, 323, 147, 504 & 506 IPC, the same being counter blast to
