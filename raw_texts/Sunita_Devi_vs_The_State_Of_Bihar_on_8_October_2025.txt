Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 1
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
Pakribarawan P.S. Case No. 21 of 2007, whereby Respondent
No.2 has been acquitted by the learned Trial Court from the
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025
2/15
charge of Section 302/201 of the Indian Penal Code.
3. Vide order dated 22.07.2025, Trial Court records
was called for, which was received on 25.08.2025.
4. Vide order dated 12.08.2024, notice was issued to
the Respondent No.2, upon which he appeared by filing
Vakalatnama through learned Advocate, Mr. Rang Nath
Choubey.
5. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on
24.02.2007
, the informant Baleshwar Yadav gave statement before the Police that two days before, his sons,
namely, Manoj Yadav and Upendra Yadav quarreled on the issue of selling of paddy. Upendra Yadav
had sold sixty mounds of paddy and on 22.02.2007, he went to khalihan for taking care of the paddy
but when did not return till the next morning, the informant as well as his family members tried to
search him but failed. On 23.02.2007, the purchaser of the paddy took away purchased paddy. On
the next day, the informant and other villagers went towards khalihan and found the dead body of
Upendra Yadav lying under straw. Manoj Yadav fled away and on suspicion, the informant lodged
the F.I.R. against respondent No.2 and other unknown accused.
6. On the basis of the written report by the informant, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of
2022 dt.08-10-2025 Pakribarawan P.S. Case No.21 of 2007 was instituted under Section 302/201 of
the Indian Penal Code and investigation was taken up by the Police. The Police, after investigation,
submitted charge-sheet against Respondent No.2 and, accordingly, cognizance was taken.
Thereafter, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions. Charges were framed against the
accused person to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
7. During the trial, the prosecution examined altogether eight prosecution witnesses, i.e., PW1-
Sunita Devi, PW2- Trigun Kumar Yadav, PW3- Sadhu Yadav @ Sahdev Yadav, PW4- Sothi Prasad
Mahto, PW5- Parwatiya Devi, PW6- Jamuna Yadav, PW7- Mukul Lal and PW8- Dr. Ramchandra
Prasad. The prosecution has also produced certain documents which were marked as 'Exhibits', i.e.,
Ext.1- Signature of Trigun Kumar Yadav on inquest report, Ext.2- Signature of Md. Nasim Ahmed
on F.I.R., Ext.2/1- Writing and signature of Police Inspector Yogendra Baitha on fardbeyan, and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 2
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
Ext.3- Writing and signature of Dr. Ramchandra Prasad on Postmortem. No witness has been
examined on behalf of the defence. After closure of prosecution evidence, the statement of the
accused person was recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. and after conclusion of trial, learned
Trial Court has Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 acquitted the
accused person.
8. The learned Trial Court on the basis of the materials available on record, and the evidence
produced before the Court, acquitted respondent No.2 observing that the witnesses have not
supported the case of the prosecution as the version in the evidence of the witnesses is
contradictory. The FIR was lodged only on the basis of suspicion. Further, the deceased went to
khalihan alone in the night. Hence, the story of the last seen principle projected by the prosecution
cannot be believed. Hence, there is no other circumstantial evidence to suggest the participation of
the accused.
9. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that learned Trial Court had not examined the
informant Baleshwar Yadav as he died before the Trial although, he specifically alleged that Manoj
Yadav had killed his elder son, Upendra Yadav and fled away. He further submits that the learned
Trial Court has acquitted the accused persons without considering the depositions of PW-1 & PW-4,
who have fully supported the case of the prosecution.
10. The learned counsel for the State as well as the learned counsel for Respondent No.2 have
submitted that there is no perversity in the judgment of the learned Trial Court, and Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt
of the accused before the learned trial court. Therefore, the order of the learned Trial Court requires
no interference in the present case.
11. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant, learned APP for the State and the learned
counsel appearing for the Respondent No.2 and have also gone through the records of the case.
12. The sole question that requires consideration by this Court is whether the impugned judgment
requires any interference by this Court.
13. Upon a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence available on record, this Court finds that the
entire prosecution case is founded solely on suspicion and circumstantial evidence, without any
direct proof connecting the accused with the commission of the offence.
14. The First Information Report (FIR) was admittedly lodged only on the basis of suspicion, as
there was no eye-witness to the incident nor any direct knowledge of the accused's involvement. It is
a well-settled proposition of law that "suspicion, however strong, cannot take the place of proof"
as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Basheera Begam vs. Mohammed Ibrahim
and Ors. reported in (2020) 11 SCC 174, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of
2022 dt.08-10-2025 in paragraph 189 of the judgment which reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 3
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
"189. It is well settled, suspicion however strong cannot substitute proof beyond
reasonable doubt. Enmity as a result of property related disputes may give rise to
suspicion. However, conviction can never be based on suspicion unless the
prosecution clearly proves circumstances conclusively and all circumstances proved
should only point to the guilt of the accused. Possibility of any conclusion other than
the conclusion of guilt of the accused would vitiate a conviction."
15. In the present case, the FIR, being based on mere suspicion, cannot by itself form the foundation
of a conviction unless supported by credible and cogent evidence.
16. The prosecution has sought to rely on circumstantial evidence, but the chain of circumstances
necessary to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt remains incomplete and inconsistent. It has
come on record that there was a quarrel between the deceased and the accused regarding the sale of
paddy; however, no material has been produced to show that such quarrel led to the death of the
deceased. The existence of motive alone, without any connecting link between the accused and the
act of killing, is insufficient to convict.
17. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022
dt.08-10-2025 Maharashtra reported in (1984) 4 SCC 116, the Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the
five golden principles governing cases based on circumstantial evidence, that the circumstances
must be fully established, consistent only with the guilt of the accused, and must exclude every
hypothesis of innocence, as observed in paragraphs 152 and 153 of the judgment which reads as
under:
"152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the High Court we would like to cite a
few decisions on the nature, character and essential proof required in a criminal case
which rests on circumstantial evidence alone. The most fundamental and basic
decision of this Court is Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh [(1952) 2 SCC 71 :
AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 :
1953 Cri LJ 129] . This case has been uniformly followed and applied by this Court in
a large number of later decisions up-to-date, for instance, the cases of Tufail (Alias)
Simmi v. State of Uttar Pradesh [(1969) 3 SCC 198 : 1970 SCC (Cri) 55] and
Ramgopal v. State of Maharashtra [(1972) 4 SCC 625 : AIR 1972 SC 656] . It may be
useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has laid down in Hanumant case [(1952) 2 SCC 71 :
AIR 1952 SC 343 : 1952 SCR 1091 : 1953 Cri LJ 129] :
"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,
the circumstances from which the conclusion of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be
fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the
hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a
conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every
hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a chain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 4
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion
consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that
within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused."
153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled
before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:
(1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned "must or should"
and not "may be" established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between "may
be proved" and "must be or should be proved" as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade
v. State of Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC 793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the
observations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807:
SCC (Cri) p. 1047] Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025
"Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be
guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between 'may be' and 'must
be' is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions."
(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt
of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis
except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive
nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the
one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to
leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the
accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by
the accused."
18. In the present case, the circumstances do not form such a complete chain. On the contrary, they
leave open several gaps and possibilities consistent with the innocence of the accused.
19. Further, the "last seen" theory is not attracted in this case. The evidence shows that the deceased
went alone to the Khalihan on the night of the occurrence. No witness has Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 deposed to having seen him in the company of the accused
either before or after the incident. In Bodhraj @ Bodha v. State of Jammu & Kashmir reported in
(2002) 8 SCC 45, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed in paragraph 31 as under:
"31. The last-seen theory comes into play where the time-gap between the point of
time when the accused and the deceased were last seen alive and when the deceased
is found dead is so small that possibility of any person other than the accused being
the author of the crime becomes impossible. It would be difficult in some cases to
positively establish that the deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 5
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
long gap and possibility of other persons coming in between exists. In the absence of
any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused and the deceased were last
seen together, it would be hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases..."
20. It is also pertinent to note that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are contradictory
and inconsistent. Some witnesses have exaggerated facts beyond the FIR, while others have
contradicted their earlier statements before the Police. One witness stated that the accused left the
village in anger and went to Rajasthan, another claimed that they caught hold of accused in another
village, where he admitted that he Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025
has got the deceased kidnapped. Such discrepancies and contradictions severely affect the credibility
of the prosecution's version.
21. In criminal jurisprudence, the presumption of innocence of the accused is a cardinal principle,
and the burden of proof lies entirely on the prosecution. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kali Ram v.
State of Himachal Pradesh, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 808, observed that if two views are possible,
one pointing towards guilt and the other towards innocence, the view favourable to the accused
must be adopted, as observed in paragraph 25 of the judgment, which reads as under:
"25. Another golden thread which runs through the web of the administration of
justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in
the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the
view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. This principle has a
special relevance in cases wherein the guilt of the accused is sought to be established
by circumstantial evidence. Rule has accordingly been laid down that unless the
evidence adduced in the case is consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the
accused and is inconsistent with that of his innocence, the Court should refrain from
recording a finding of guilt of the accused. It is also an Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 accepted rule that in case the Court entertains
reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused, the accused must have the
benefit of that doubt..."
22. In the present case, the prosecution has not been able to prove the charge beyond all reasonable
doubts. The chain of circumstances is broken, the witnesses are unreliable, and the foundational
FIR is based only on suspicion. The possibility that some other person or factor might have been
responsible for the death cannot be ruled out.
23. Accordingly, this Court finds that the learned Trial Court has correctly observed that the
prosecution failed to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused
is entitled to the benefit of doubt.
24. We find that the findings recorded by the learned Trial Court do not suffer from any illegality
and perversity. In a criminal case, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the
accused beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Wherever, any doubt is cast upon the case of the
prosecution, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt.

25. In criminal appeal against acquittal what the Appellate Court has to examine is whether the
finding of the learned court below is perverse and prima facie illegal. Once the Patna High Court CR.
APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 Appellate Court comes to the finding that the grounds on
which the judgment is based is not perverse, the scope of appeal against acquittal is limited
considering the fact that the legal presumption about the innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by the finding of the Court. At this point, it is imperative to consider the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrinal Das vs. State of Tripura reported in(2011) 9 SCC 479,
paragraphs 13 & 14 of which read as under:
"13. It is clear that in an appeal against acquittal in the absence of perversity in the
judgment and order, interference by this Court exercising its extraordinary
jurisdiction, is not warranted. However, if the appeal is heard by an appellate court, it
being the final court of fact, is fully competent to reappreciate, reconsider and review
the evidence and take its own decision. In other words, the law does not prescribe any
limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and the appellate court
is free to arrive at its own conclusion keeping in mind that acquittal provides for
presumption in favour of the accused. The presumption of innocence is available to
the person and in criminal jurisprudence every person is presumed to be innocent
unless he is proved guilty by the competent court. If two reasonable views are
possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb
the findings of acquittal.
14. There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence
upon which the order of acquittal is found and to come to its own conclusion. The
appellate court Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 can
also review the conclusion arrived at by the trial court with respect to both facts and
law. While dealing with the appeal against acquittal preferred by the State, it is the
duty of the appellate court to marshal the entire evidence on record and only by
giving cogent and adequate reasons set aside the judgment of acquittal. An order of
acquittal is to be interfered with only when there are "compelling and substantial
reasons" for doing so. If the order is "clearly unreasonable", it is a compelling reason
for interference.........."
26. In the case of Ghurey Lal versus State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2008) 10 SCC 450 in
paragraph 75, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
"75. The trial Court has the advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses
who have given evidence, therefore, the appellate court should be slow to interfere
with the decisions of the trial court. An acquittal by the trial court should not be
interfered with unless it is totally perverse or wholly unsustainable."
27. Thus, an order of acquittal is to be interfered with only for compelling and substantial reasons.
In case if the order is clearly unreasonable, it is a compelling reason for interference. But where
there is no perversity in the finding of the impugned judgment of acquittal, the Appellate Court must
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/117287691/ 7
Sunita Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 8 October, 2025
not take a different view only because another view is possible. It is because the trial Court has the
privilege of seeing the demeanour of witnesses and, therefore, its decision must not be Patna High
Court CR. APP (DB) No.629 of 2022 dt.08-10-2025 upset in absence of strong and compelling
grounds.
28. In view of the above, we do not find any illegality and perversity in the findings recorded by the
Trial Court.
29. Accordingly, the present appeal is dismissed.
30. Pending applications(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
31. This Court records the appreciation for the able and articulate submissions made by Mr. Abhinav
Shrivastava, senior advocate acting as amicus curiae in the present case. The clarity and depth of the
arguments have significantly contributed to the comprehensive understanding of the complex legal
issues involved in this matter.
