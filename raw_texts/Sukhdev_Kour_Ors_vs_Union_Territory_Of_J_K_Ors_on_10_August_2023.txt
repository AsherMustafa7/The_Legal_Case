JUDGMENT
1. By invoking the inherent powers jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(hereinafter referred as to the 'Code'), petitioners by instant petition seek quashment of FIR No.
78/2021 dated 18.08.2021 registered against them in Police Station Sunderbani for the commission
of offence punishable under sections 458, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC on the complaint of respondent
No.4 directing respondent No.3 not to harass the petitioners in a false and frivolous case and also
produce the reports in the FIR No. 68/2021 dated 18.07.2021 registered against Noor Hussain,
Afasra Bi and others conducted during earlier investigation and to disclose before this Court as to
what steps were taken by him during investigation before registering FIR against the petitioners
after receipt of false and frivolous complaint filed by Afsra Bi.
2. Brief facts of the case are, that petitioner No.1 is elected Sarpanch of Panchyat Halqa Marchola
Block Siot, petitioner No.2 is Ph.D research Scholar and petitioner No.3 is B.Sc Radiology were
implicated in a false and frivolous case filed by one Afsra Bi and respondent No.3 without
conducting any enquiry lodged impugned FIR under sections 458, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC against
the petitioners on instigating by respondent No.5 (ex-sarpanch) to respondent No.7; that the
petitioners and respondents 4 to 7 are residents of same Panchyat and had rivalry on issues of

Sukhdev Kour & Ors vs Union Territory Of J&K & Ors on 10 August, 2023
election contested by petitioner No.1 and wife of respondent No.5 being reserved constituency for
women; complainant Afsra Bi and her family recently resident of Surankote Drabha now putting up
in Panchyat Marchola on Forest Land are neighbors of respondents 5 to 7 and have land disputes
over a piece of Forest land which was illegally occupied by Noor Hussain; petitioner No.1 being
Sarpanch of the area having every right to inform the Govt. officials regarding the activities held in
the Panchyat; with that revenge full mindset Afsra Bi filed as application against petitioners before
respondent No.3, who had lodged FIR No. 78 dated 18.08.2021 for the commission of offences
punishable under sections 458, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC against the petitioners in order to drag them
into false litigation with a revenge on the issues of election contested, whereas the police has already
looking into the matter in FIR No. 68/2021 dated 18.07.2021 lodged by petitioner No.1 against
respondent No. 4 and others; the grounds projected in the application are false and vague as such on
the false grounds mentioned in the application which is a false story and allegations projected in the
application by Afsra Bi on the instructions of Vipon Paul @ Veepttu i.e respondent No.5 seems not
to be genuine and justified against the petitioner which causes un due harassment to the petitioners.
3. Being aggrieved of the impugned FIR and the investigation being carried out by respondent No.3
in the said case, petitioners have challenged the same on the following grounds:
a) that allegation leveled against the petitioners in a complaint filed by Afsra Bi is an
abuse of the process of law, inherently improvable and suffers from legal defects,
flaws.
b) that impugned FIR No. 78/2021 under Sections 458, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC has
been registered by the respondent No.1 in a manner which is unknown to the
criminal jurisprudence, the same, therefore, deserves to be quashed.
c) that the respondent No.3 is fully apprised about the commission of crime which
has already been investigated with regard to crime which was not committed by the
petitioners despite being made aware of the actual circumstances under which the
Afsra Bi has filed a false and concocted complaint against the petitioners, the police
of Police Station Sunderbani conducted investigation against the petitioners found
nothing incriminating evidences against the petitioners. The concerned SHO
although committed an irregularity of conducting the investigation against the
petitioners is concerned.
d) the petitioners have no concern with the incident and the said Afsra Bi has falsely
implicating them due toearlier forest land dispute, election rivalry with respondent
No.5 and is trying to produce the false witness.
e) that from bare perusal of the story as projected in the complaint clearly shows that
the petitioners are no manner involved in any of the alleged incident nor was present
at the alleged place of occurrence, despite that they have been unnecessarily roped
into the alleged crime. It clearly shows that the respondent No.3 has used the
complaint filed by Afsra Bi as a tool to harass and cause prejudice to the petitioners.

Sukhdev Kour & Ors vs Union Territory Of J&K & Ors on 10 August, 2023
This aspect of the case has also not been appreciated or looked by the respondent
No.3 which renders the impugned FIR totally illegal and liable to be quashed.
f) that the respondents 5 to 7 are highhandedness persons having links with higher
officials on their instruction FIR was lodged against the petitioner, they are involved
in many illegal activities and had LB-6-432 (400K) forest land was occupied by them
but they are not implicated in any offence due to their higher approach inasmuch as
they run a illegal Gun Factory in the name and style Umer Din Gun Factory
Marcholla, transports illegal Arms, recently in Gujarat some persons were arrested
having in possession of illegal Arms which was prepared by them and they are master
mind behind lodging of FIR against the petitioners.
4. During pendency of this petition a compromise was arrived at between the petitioners and
respondent No.4. In view of the amicable outside court settlement and compromised they have
decided to close the cases against each other.
5. The instant petition supported by an affidavit of the petitioner.
6. Pursuant to the order dated 24.04.2023, contesting parties were directed to record their
statements before the Registrar Judicial of this Court in view of the compromise arrived at between
them. In this regard, the Registrar Judicial has recorded the statements of petitioners 1 & 3 and
respondent No.4, the same are placed on record which read as under:-

R/o Ward No. 7, Marcholla, Tehsil Sunderbani, District Rajouri on oath today i.e

Sukhdev Kour & Ors vs Union Territory Of J&K & Ors on 10 August, 2023
Stated, that I have amicably resolved all disputes and issues with Sukhdev Kour
(petitioner no.1), Gurjinder Kour (petitioner no.2) and Harneek Singh (petitioner
no.3). Further, I have no grievance against the petitioners and I do not want to
pursue the FIR filed by me against the petitioners. In view of our amicable
settlement, I have no objection in case Hon'ble Court quashes FIR No. 78/2021 dated
18.08.2021 registered by me against petitioners at Police Station Sunderbani, Rajouri
by Afsra Bi (respondent no.4) for commission of offences under section 458, 323,
405, 506 and 427 IPC
7. Bare perusal of the statements of petitioners placed on record demonstrates that the parties have
entered into a compromise whereby they have settled their differences. A question, in view of the
aforesaid factual position, has arisen as to whether this Court has power to quash the proceedings,
particularly when some of the offences alleged to have been committed by the petitioners, are
non-compoundable in nature.
8. The Apex Court in the case of B. S. Joshi & others Vs State of Haryana and another, reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 675 while discussing the ambit and scope of inherent powers of High Courts under
Section 482 CPC in paras 1, 3, 13, 14, 15 and 16 held as under :
"1.The question that falls for determination in the instant case is about the ambit of
the inherent powers of the High Courts under Section 482, Code of Criminal
Procedure (Code) read with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to
quash criminal proceedings. The scope and ambit of power under Section 482 has
been examined by this Court in catena of earlier decisions but in the present case that
is required to be considered in relation to matrimonial disputes. The matrimonial
disputes of the kind in the present case have been on considerable increase in recent
times resulting in filing of complaints by the wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC
not only against the husband but his other family members also. When such matters
are resolved either by wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or mutual
separation of husband and wife and also mutual settlement of other pending disputes
as a result whereof both sides approach the High Court and jointly pray for quashing
of the criminal proceedings or the First Information Report or complaint filed by the
wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC, can the prayer be declined on the ground
that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code and,
therefore, it is not permissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR
or complaint.
3.The High Court has, by the impugned judgment, dismissed the petition filed by the
appellants seeking quashing of the FIR for in view of the High Court the offences
under Sections 498A and 406 IPC are non-compoundable and the inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code cannot be invoked to bypass the mandatory provision
of Section 320 of the Code. For its view, the High Court has referred to and relied
upon the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan Lal & Ors. [1992
Supp.(1) SCC 335]; Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35784642/ 4
Sukhdev Kour & Ors vs Union Territory Of J&K & Ors on 10 August, 2023
and Surendra Nath Mohanty & Anr. v. State of Orissa [AIR 1999 SC 2181].
11.In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Ors. v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre & Ors.
[(1988) 1 SCC 692], it was held that while exercising inherent power of quashing
under Section 482, it is for the High Court to take into consideration any special
features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in
the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. Where, in the opinion of
the Court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful
purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the
court may, while taking into consideration the special facts of a case, also quash the
proceedings.
14.There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section
498A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband
or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a
husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives
to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be
counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object
for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of
inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent
women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal
Code.
15.In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section
320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.
16.For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment and allow the
appeal and quash the FIR above mentioned."
9. Ratio of the judgment of B. S. Joshi's case (supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear
that the High Court has inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice if the parties have settled their disputes amicably
by a compromise. Ratio of judgment (supra) is squarely applicable to the facts of the case in hand.
10. In the case in hand the parties have arrived at a compromise, so there would be no chance of
conviction in near future in case trial is held and concluded.
11. In view of the above, the instant petition stands allowed. Consequently, FIR No. 78/2021 dated
18.08.2021 registered against the petitioners in Police Station Sunderbani for the commission of
offence punishable under sections 458, 323, 504, 506, 427 IPC is hereby quashed, in view of
compromise arrived at between the parties.
12. Copy of this order be sent to SHO Police Station, Sunderbani for compliance.
