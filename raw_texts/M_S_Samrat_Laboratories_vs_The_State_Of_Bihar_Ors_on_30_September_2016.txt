JUDGMENT AND ORDER
C.A.V.
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date: 30-09-2016
In these six writ petitions, the petitioners challenge
the authority of the State Government to prohibit their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 3
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
business in and with regard to denatured spirit, which is unfit
for human consumption. Specifically, the challenge is (i) to
the notification, dated 04.02.2016, issued by the State
Government, in so far as it prohibit distilleries, in the State, to
manufacture rectified spirit after 29.02.2016 and further
wherever, in course of manufacture of Ethanol/Extra Neutral
Alcohol (ENA), whatever denatured spirit or any other bye-
product is produced, it shall be compulsorily destroyed; and
(ii) that part of the letter, dated 17.03.2016, issued by the
Commissioner Excise, Bihar, Patna, which directs the
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
-4-
Collectors-cum-District Magistrates of Bihar not to renew
licences, wholesale or retail, for dealing in denatured spirit and
not to grant new licences in respect thereof. Consequential
challenge is to the consequences thereof.
2. Petitioners of the first two writ petitions
(C.W.J.C. Nos. 5795 of 2016 and 6054 of 2016), namely, M/s
Samrat Laboratories and M/s Shiva Laboratories Private
Limited are industrial units engaged in the production of
organic chemicals, namely, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, acetic
anhydride, vinyl acetate, organic solvents, formaldehyde and
surgical spirits. These are basically lacquer, sealant, paint
remover, thinner, premixed varnish and surgical spirits. The
main raw material for this industry is rectified spirit/ethyl
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 4
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
alcohol (ethanol) (industrial grade), methyl alcohol (methanol)
(formaldehyde).
3. It may be noted that before rectified spirit/ethyl
alcohol is issued from various distilleries to the petitioners(cid:128)
industry, it is added with specified denaturants rendering it
unfit for human consumption. Upon its being denatured, it is
termed as denatured spirit/special denatured spirit. Both these
units have permission to store over one lakh bulk liters of
special denatured spirit on monthly basis, which is the basic
raw material for the industry by orders of the Excise
Commissioner, Bihar. In respect of these units, they held
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
-5-
licences, in Form No.24, granted by the respective Collectors
of the districts in which the industry is situated.
4. Section 90 of the Bihar Excise Act, 1915 (in
short, â€žthe Act(cid:128)) empowers the Board of Revenue to frame
rules and, in exercise of that power, the Board of Revenue
issued notification No.23-137-2, dated 29.04.1919, published
in the Bihar and Orissa Gazette, dated 07.05.1919, a set of
rules. Rule 63 to Rule 71 thereof deals with denatured spirit.
Rule 63 thereof provides for substances, which may be used as
"denaturants". Rule 64 of the Rules provides that spirit may
be denatured only under licences issued by the Collector at the
distilleries or excise warehouse. Rule 65 provides for licence to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 5
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
denatured spirit at distillery. For this, distilleries are issued
licences in Excise Form No.25. Rule 69 further provides that
distilleries shall, ordinarily, not manufacture denatured spirit
exceeding 10% of the total portable quantity and denatured
spirit from the distilleries are to be delivered to any person
only on production of export or transport pass. Rule 69 further
provides for regulating the sale and purchase of denatured
spirit by wholesale or retail licensee.
5. The Board of Revenue has issued executive
instructions referable to, apart from others, Section 38 (1) (b)
of the Act, with regard to the process of denaturing, storage
and issuance of denatured spirit and various licenses in respect
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
-6-
thereof. Paragraph 192 thereof provides for limit of retail sale.
Paragraph 193 thereof provides for licences including licence in
the prescribed From No.24 for possession of denatured spirit in
excess of limit of retail sale. Licence in Form No.24 are
prescribed under these executive instructions and licence in
Form No.24, which these two industries hold, for storing
denatured spirit in bulk quantities, are issued by the respective
district Collectors. From this, it would be seen that denatured
spirit being the basic raw material for these industries, a
licence in Form No.24 is a pre-requisite as per executive
instructions issued by the Board of Revenue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 6
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
6. Thus seen, if the distilleries, which produce
denatured spirit, are prohibited from selling denatured spirit or
to be compulsorily destroyed as per the impugned notification,
dated 04.02.2016, and the licences, in Form No.24, of these
two industries not having been renewed, pursuant to the
impugned letter, dated 17.03.2016, of the Excise
Commissioner, it would amount to complete closure of the two
industries, whose basic raw material is denatured spirit.
Effectively, down stream products like industrial thinner,
varnish, surgical spirits and several other organic chemicals
cannot be manufactured and sold in Bihar. This action of the
State has brought these two industries to this Court
challenging the actions of the State in this regard.

7. The next two writ petitions, namely, C.W.J.C.
Nos.7411 of 2016 and 7550 of 2016 are by wholesalers and
retailers of denatured spirit, who have licences in Form No.22
and 23 as prescribed under the executive instructions issued
by the Board of Revenue. Consequent to the impugned letter,
dated 17.03.2016, of the State Government, their licences
have not been renewed, thereby totally stopping their business
in denatured spirit.
8. The last two writ petitions, namely, C.W.J.C.
Nos. 7634 of 2016 and 10598 of 2016 are by the same
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 7
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
company. It is licensed to manufacture Extra-Neutral Alcohol
(ENA) and is a grain based distillery situated, at Amarpur, in
the district of Banka, having been set up with the approval of
Department of Commerce and Industries, Government of
India, with an investment of over Rs.200 crores. It has
licences in Form No.28 A and Form No.25. In the process of
manufacturing ENA, the manufacturing of which is not
prohibited in this State, about 7 to 10% impure spirit is
produced, which is denatured and sale thereof as denatured
spirit gets them extra revenue of about Rs.1.50 crores. It has
a stock of about 2 lakh bulk liters of denatured spirit. The
grievance of the distillery is that by virtue of the Government
notification, dated 04.02.2016, they are required to destroy
the entire stocks of denatured spirit and, in future, whatever
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
-8-
stocks are produced shall also be compulsorily destroyed.
Thus, they are aggrieved by this part of the notification as it
amounts to virtual confiscation of denatured spirit produced in
the course of production of Ethanol/ENA.
9. In the last writ petition, namely, C.W.J.C. No.
10598 of 2016, the petitioners have made a further grievance
that even the ENA or ethanol, as legitimately produced by
them, are concerned, they are not being granted export
permits merely because they have chosen to challenge the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 8
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
Government notification as aforesaid, even though they have
ready buyers from outside the State. Other distilleries, who
have not come to this Court, are being granted export permits,
the result being that the petitioners(cid:128) distilleries have to be shut
down. The action, in this respect, it is submitted, is
contemptuous and designed to thwart judicial redressal before
this Court.
10. The basic submission, on behalf of the writ
petitioners, as made by Mr. Satyabir Bharti, learned Counsel,
is that denatured spirit, undisputedly, being unfit for human
consumption and being industrial alcohol, though can be
regulated, in a limited manner by the State, its production and
usage, as an industrial raw material, cannot be prohibited by
the State being beyond its legislative competence. Further,
the notification, dated 04.02.2016, as issued by the State
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
-9-
Government, not being issued under, or with respect to, any
legislation of the Central Government or the State
Government, but with reference to the New Excise Policy,
2015, of the State Government, would be clearly ultra vires
the powers and authority of the State Government. Further,
the notification, dated 04.02.2016, and the letter, dated
17.03.2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 9
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
, amounting to total prohibition of manufacturing, sale, possession and use of denatured spirit,
would clearly be an unreasonable and arbitrary restriction on the rights to carry on business and
trade in rectified /denatured spirit and, that too, could not be done by mere executive fiat.
11. To the contrary, Mr. Lalit Kishore, learned Principal Additional Advocate General, submits that
by virtue of provisions of the Bihar Excise Act, 1915, denatured spirit is included with the definition
of â€žintoxicant(cid:128) and the State has competence not only to legislate in respect of intoxicant, but to
prohibit its manufacturing and trade therein, notwithstanding the fact that the so called
â€žintoxicant(cid:128) may be industrial alcohol unfit for human consumption. Having prohibited the trade in
denatured spirit, its possession would be illegal and, therefore, orders for its compulsory destruction
would not amount to confiscation.
12. First, we would like to take up the issue, as raised by the learned Principal Additional Advocate
General, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 10 -
that denatured spirit is an â€žintoxicant(cid:128), as defined under the Bihar Excise Act, 1915, and, that being
so, State has the legislative competence and jurisdiction to regulate, to the extent of prohibiting
possession, sale or usage thereof, as no person has a fundamental right to deal in intoxicant. The
first thing to be noted is that we are dealing with the provisions of the Bihar Excise Act, which was
framed, issued and enforced in the year 1915, several decades prior to the Constitution of India. At
that time, there was no such division of legislative fields as between the Union and the State and
there were no such restrictions, on legislative powers, as provided for under the Constitution of
India. However, we may note the provisions first. The relevant provisions would be, as per definition
clause, as under:
"2 (19) "spirit" means any liquor containing alcohol obtained by distillation, whether
it is denatured or not;
2 (5) (a) "denaturant" means any substance prescribed by rule made in this behalf
under clause (3) of Section 90, for admixture with spirit in order to render the
mixture unfit for human consumption, whether as a beverage, or internally as a
medicine, or any other way whatsoever;
(b) "to denature" means to mix spirit with one or more denaturants in such manner
as may be prescribed by rule made in this behalf under clause (3) of Section 90, and
"denatured Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 11 -
spirit" means spirit so mixed;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 10
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
2(14) "Liquor" includes all liquids consisting of or containing alcohol, such as spirits of wine, spirit,
wine, fermented tari, pachwai and beer, and also unfermented tari, and also any other substance
which the State Government may, by notification, declare to be liquor for the purposes of this Act;
2 (12a) â€žintoxicant(cid:128) means-
(i) any liquor, or
(ii) any substance from which liquor may be distilled and which is declared by the
State Government by notification in the Official Gazette to be intoxicant for the
purpose of this Act, or
(iii) intoxicating drug, or
(iv) medicinal preparation as defined under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations
(Excise Duties) Act, 1955."
(Emphasis is supplied)
13. On the strength of the aforesaid definitions, the learned Principal Additional Advocate General
submits that "spirit" includes "denatured spirit" and "liquor" includes "spirit" and therefore, "liquor"
would include "denatured spirit".
"Intoxicant" means any "liquor" and thus would include "denatured spirit" even
though by the definition of "denaturant" and to "denature", it is clear that once spirit
is denatured, it is rendered unfit for human consumption. In other words, he submits
that notwithstanding denatured spirit, by nature of thing being unfit for human
consumption, it Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 12 -
nevertheless remains, for the purposes of the Act, an intoxicant.
14. Our first answer to this submission would be that the very definition of intoxicant clause clearly
states that the definition is for the purposes of the Act, which, as noted above, is a pre-constitutional
Act. By artificially extending the meaning of a commodity, to what it is not, the State cannot usurp
the legislative competence, which it, now, lacks after the Constitution of India was adopted and
enforced. The extended meaning would only be for the purposes of the Act and only to the extent to
which the State would have the constitutional jurisdiction and not beyond that.
15. Thus, there is no gainsaying that the Act defines intoxicant to include something, which is unfit
for human consumption and not an intoxicant, the State can assume jurisdiction or legislative power
treating non-intoxicant as intoxicant. If the State lacks legislative competence in respect of
industrial alcohol, which includes denatured spirit, then, by this extended definition or artificial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 11
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
definition of intoxicant, the State cannot assume legislative competence.
16. Mr. Satyabir Bharti, learned Counsel for the petitioners, has referred to two decisions of the
Supreme Court on the issue that rectified spirit, from which denatured spirit is obtained, both
inclusive, are non-potable alcohol and are, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 13 -
therefore, industrial alcohol, which is beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature to
legislate upon.
17. With regard to the above, we may, first, note that in the case of Synthetics and Chemicals Limited
and others Vs. State of U.P. and others, reported in (1990) 1 Supreme Court Cases 109, the question,
before the seven Judge Constitution Bench, was the power and authority of the Government of Uttar
Pradesh to demand certain fees in relation to denatured spirit being supplied to the Company. In
paragraph-19 of the report, their Lordships have noted the definition of foreign liquor, in the light of
the notifications, issued under the Uttar Pradesh Excise Act, 1910, which expression would include
rectified, perfumed, medicated and denatured spirits. Notwithstanding that extended definition,
later, in the judgment, their Lordships clearly held that the rectified spirit and denatured spirit are
industrial alcohol unfit for human consumption and, thus, not potable liquor and, as such, beyond
legislative competence of the State.
18. Similarly, again, in Mohan Meakin Limited Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh and others, reported
in (2009) 3 Supreme Court Cases 157, this is what their Lordships held, in paragraph-15 :
"15. The Act is a pre-constitutional statute. Section 3 (18) of the Act defines spirit and
Section 3 (14) thereof defines liquor. These Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 14 -
definitions cover even denatured spirit. They are broadly worded pre-constitutional
definitions.... "
19. Notwithstanding the aforesaid extended definition, their Lordships clearly held, in Mohan
Meakin Limited (supra), that industrial alcohol or spirit/denatured spirit, not being alcoholic liquor
for human consumption, cannot be subject matter of any regulation or control by the State.
20. We may, now, refer to the decision of State of U.P. and others Vs. Vam Organic chemicals
Limited and others, reported in (2004) 1 Supreme Court Cases 225, wherein, while dealing with
denatured spirit/rectified spirit, this is what their Lordships held, in paragraph-29:
"29.The State(cid:128)s power is thus limited to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 12
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
(i) the regulation of non-potable alcohol for the limited purpose of preventing its use
as alcoholic liquor, and (ii) the charging of fees based on quid pro quo. ....."
21. We may hasten to add, lest it may be misunderstood, that here â€žregulation(cid:128) would not include
â€žprohibition(cid:128), because we are not dealing with potable liquor, but industrial alcohol, where
considerations are totally different.
22. Thus, in our view, there is no gainsaying that merely because an artificial extended definition, in
the Bihar Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 15 -
Excise Act, 2015, is given to the expression intoxicant, the State, by virtue of this extended
definition, automatically assume legislative competence, even over rectified spirit and/or denatured
spirit, which are inherently non-potable and unfit for human consumption. The State(cid:128)s contention
is, thus, rejected.
23. Now, we may refer to the relevant part of the impugned notifications/letter as issued by the State
Government, being notification, dated 04.02.2016, and the relevant part being clause-3 of the letter
being Excise Department(cid:128)s letter, dated 17.03.2016, the English translation whereof are quoted
hereunder:
"English translation of Clause (4)
(iii) of notification, dated 04.02.2016.
4 (iii) Working distilleries in the State shall not produce rectified spirit after 29.02.2016 from 1st
April, 2016. The molasses based distilleires shall utilize 100% of its capacity, in manufacture of
Ethanol. This Ethanol shall be supplied to Oil Companies for blending in Petrol/Diesel. From 1st
April, 2016, the grain based distilleries shall utilize 100% of its capacity, in manufacture of ENA.
During the course of manufacture of Ethanol/ ENA, whatever Denatured spirit or any other
bye-product is produced, shall be compulsorily destroyed.
English Translation of Clause (3) of
the Excise Department's letter, dated
17.03.2016
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 16 -
3. All wholesale and retail denatured spirit licenses in the State, shall not be renewed and the
licenses issued under the MNTP Act, 1955 in the State shall not be renewed and new licenses shall
not be granted. The department(cid:128)s letter dated 18.01.2016, shall be deemed to be modified to the
above extent."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 13
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
24. The effect of these two is, firstly, the distillery is to destroy its stocks of denatured spirit and
whatever is produced thereafter is also to be destroyed. Thus, not only affecting the industry with a
bye-product, which is converted into denatured spirit that has commercial value, but also drying up
the sole raw material for industry based on denatured spirit closing, thus, those industries too.
Similarly, the letter, in terms, brings about absolute prohibition in trade of denatured spirit in the
State.
25. On behalf of the petitioners, Sri Satyabir Bharti, learned Counsel, submits that in view of the
decision of the Constitution Bench, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra) followed by Vam
Organic chemicals Limited (supra) and Mohan Meakin Limited (supra), the Supreme Court has
been consistent in holding that rectified spirit and denatured spirit, being industrial alcohol and
unfit for human consumption, State lacks legislative competence in respect thereof, it being
products of a controlled industry and in view of the provisions of the Industries (Development and
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 17 -
Regulation) Act, 1951, State cannot, thus, restrict and/or prohibit the production, storage and usage
of rectified spirit or denatured spirit. The impugned notification and the impugned letter, therefore,
are beyond the legislative competence of the State. He further submits that the aforesaid impugned
notification and the impugned letter have the effect of directly impinging upon and restricting the
fundamental rights of the distilleries, the industry and the dealers, though no restriction on the
fundamental rights can be imposed by executive fiat. The notification, not being with reference to
any law, as made by the legislature, and the letter, being merely executive instructions, cannot, in
any way, restrict or abridge the fundamental rights. Such action would be clearly arbitrary and
unreasonable; so contends Mr. Bharti.
26. To the contrary, the learned Principal Additional Advocate General submits, with reference to
the Constitution Bench decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji and others Vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and
others (AIR 1956 Supreme Court 676), that notwithstanding fermentation industries and products
thereof being within the declaration in terms of Entry 52 of List I of the 7th Schedule to the
Constitution, under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (hereinafter, in short,
referred to as â€žthe IDR Act(cid:128)), the products of such an industry would fall under Patna High Court
CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 18 -
Entry 33 of List III of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution. Thus, the State would have concurrent
jurisdiction in relation thereto with the Union Government and unless there is specific legislation by
the Union, factually and actually occupying the field of legislation in relation to the products of such
an industry, the legislative competence of the State cannot be taken away.
27. It is the contention of the learned Principal Additional Advocate General that the State
legislation cannot be said to be repugnant to the Central legislation unless there is actual conflict
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 14
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
between the two legislations. Thus, according to learned Principal Additional Advocate General, the
State has the necessary legislative competence to prohibit production, sale, trade and commerce in
those goods, i.e., rectified spirit/denatured spirit. Learned Principal Additional Advocate General
places further reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court, in Ishwari Khetan Sugar Mills (P) Ltd.
and others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others, reported in (1980) 4 Supreme Court Cases 136 =
AIR 1980 Supreme Court 1955. He further submits that the Constitution Bench decision, in
Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), has been doubted by three Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court, in State of Uttar Pradesh and others Vs. Lalta Prasad Vaish, reported in (2007) 13 Supreme
Court Cases 463, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 19 -
and the reference is, now, pending consideration before nine Judge Bench of the Supreme Court for
reconsideration of Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra). Learned Principal Additional
Advocate General almost urges the Court not to feel, in the light of the facts of the present case,
bound by the decision in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra).
28. First, we may refer to Article 246 of the Constitution of India, which is quoted hereunder:
"246. Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States -
(1) Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power
to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated to List I in the seventh
Schedule.
(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and, subject to clause (1), the
Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the
matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule.
(3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to
make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters
enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule.
(4) Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the
territory of India not included (in a State) notwithstanding that such matter is a
matter Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 20 -
enumerated in the State List."
29. Then, we may quote Article 254 of the Constitution of India:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 15
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
"254. Inconsistency between laws made by Parliament and laws made by the
Legislatures of State. -
(1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any
provision of a law made by Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to
any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the
Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by
Parliament, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of such
State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by the
Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.
(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters
enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the
provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to
that mater, then, the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall, if it has been
reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent, prevail in the
State:
Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any
time Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 21 -
any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying
or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State."
30. Now, we may come to the relevant Entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution:
"Seventh Schedule List I - Union List
52. Industries, the control of which by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to
be expedient in the public interest.
54. Regulation of mines and minerals development to the extent to which such

medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in
sub-paragraph (b) of this Entry.
66. Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in
any court.
List III - Concurrent List
33. Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of, -

(a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is
declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of

the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products;
(b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils;
(c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates;
(d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and
(e) raw jute.
42. Acquisition and requisitioning of property.
47. Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in any court."
31. The first thing to be noted is, as is well established, that the entries, in the 7th Schedule to the
Constitution, are entries demarcating the legislative fields conferring jurisdiction on the respective
legislature to enact laws. Article 246 (1) gives prominence and dominance to the Parliament in
respect of legislative fields as enumerated in List I of the 7th Schedule. Sub-clause (2) thereof deals
with concurrent powers in respect of legislative fields, as enumerated in List III of the 7th Schedule,
but it makes the power of the State subject to power of the Parliament. Sub- clause (3) clearly
stipulates that State has exclusive powers in respect of legislative fields covered by List II. The
scheme, thus, gives dominance to the Parliament, which has superior Patna High Court CWJC
No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 24 -
efficacy in the matter.
32. We may, then, refer to Article 254, which clearly refers to the concurrent list and, again, gives
dominance to the parliamentary legislation with an exception that in any case of repugnancy
between the parliamentary law and the State law, the State law can only be valid if it has been
reserved for consideration of the President and has received its assent.
33. When we come to the legislative fields, we find that the expression â€žindustries(cid:128) is mentioned
both in Entry 52 List I and Entry 24 List II; but plainly, Entry 52 List I stipulates that industries, in
respect of which declaration of expediency in public interest is made by the Union, would fall within
Entry 52 List I and, accordingly, Entry 24 List II would, to that extent, stand denuded of its
legislative competence and, therefore, making the provisions, in Entry 24 List II, subject, inter alia,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 18
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
to Entry 52 List I.
34. We may, now, refer to Entry 33 (a) List III, which clearly stipulates that once an industry is
declared in terms of Entry 52 List I, the products of such an industry would come within the
concurrent jurisdiction. We may, then, refer to Entry 26 and 27 of List II, which, again, are subject
to the provisions of Entry 33 List III.
35. Thus, simply put, the scheme is that, in Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 25 -
absence of a declaration in terms of Entry 52 List I, industries would be a field of legislation
available to the State in terms of Entry 24 List II and trade and commerce, production, supply and
distribution of goods associated with such industry would also fall within the legislative field
reserved for the State in terms of Entry 26 List II and Entry 27 List II; but no sooner any legislation
is made by the Parliament with a declaration in terms of Entry 52 List I in respect of an industry,
such an industry goes out of the legislative field of the State from Entry 24 List II. Consequent to
such a declaration, the trade and commerce and the production, supply and distribution of the
goods of the declared industry, would, then, come in Entry 33 of List III, taking it out of Entry 26
and 27 respectively of List II. In such an event, if the Parliamentary legislation, in respect of any
industry, covers the field of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution of goods of
such an industry, then, by virtue of Article 254 of the Constitution of India, the parliamentary
legislation would prevail unless the State legislation, in respect thereof, has been reserved for
consideration of the President and received his assent.
36. We may, now, first, refer to the decision of the Constitution Bench, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), on
which strong reliance is placed by learned Principal Additional Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of
2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 26 -
Advocate General. The Constitution Bench decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), dealt with the
competence of the U.P. State Legislature to enact law with regard to sugarcane. In terms of Entry 52
of List I and the declaration contemplated therein, the Parliament had enacted IDR Act, 1951. In the
Schedule thereto, Entry 25 was "sugar" meaning thereby "sugar industry". The contention was that
sugar industry, having been declared, in terms of Entry 52 of List I, the State legislation, with regard
to sugarcane, the raw material of the sugar industry, was beyond competence of the State
Legislature. The Court rejected the argument.
37. In paragraph 24 of Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), the Court has clearly held that in view of the
declaration in terms of Entry 52 List I, both sugar and sugarcane would not fall within Entry 52 List
I as they are product and raw material of the industry. As a raw material, sugarcane would fall in
Entry 27 List II and sugar would fall in Entry 33 List III. But sugarcane being foodstuff would, then,
come to Entry 33 List III and both the Parliament and the State Legislature would operate in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 19
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
concurrent fields. Clearly, what the Constitution Bench meant, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), was that
sugarcane did not form part of the industry, as envisaged under Entry 52 List I, sugarcane being the
raw material for the industry, which manufactures sugar and the Union declaration cover sugar and
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 27 -
not sugarcane.
38. With regard to the above, we may note what was said in paragraph 18 if it is read with paragraph
23 of the decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), in relation to sugarcane. What is said is that sugarcane
is the raw material and not the finished product of sugar industry and, therefore, though sugar
would come under Entry 33 List III, being product of controlled industry, sugarcane does not fall in
it. Sugarcane, being raw material and not product of the industry, would, then, come under Entry 27
of List II; but Entry 33 List III was amended to include foodstuffs. The effect of this amendment to
Entry 33 of List III would be that, now, sugarcane would come within the scope of Entry 33 List III
and, as such, State would have concurrent legislative powers in respect of both sugarcane and sugar.
In paragraph 34 of the report, their Lordships, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), took note of Section 18 G
of the IDR Act to hold that IDR Act was not applicable to the raw material like sugarcane and, thus,
sugarcane was not covered under the IDR Act. That being so, the field of legislation of the IDR Act
and the Uttar Pradesh Act were different. Thus, the State legislation was upheld not because
sugarcane fell within the legislative field under List II, but because it fell within the legislative field
of Entry 33 List III.
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 28 -
39. Here, Mr. Satyabir Bharti, learned Counsel for the petitioners, points out that there is a basic
difference or distinction. Firstly, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra), while dealing with sugar industry, the
product sugar was held to fall within Entry 33 of List III, that is, the concurrent jurisdiction, but
when we come to the present case, the Entry, in the Schedule of IDR Act, is Entry 26 "fermentation
industry", which is quoted hereunder:
"The First Schedule
26. Fermentation Industries:
(1) Alcohol (2) Other products of fermentation industries."
40. Therefore, the declaration, in terms of Entry 52 of List I, is also in respect to products of such a
fermentation industry. This is a vital distinction. We will advert to this again.

M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
41. The learned Principal Additional Advocate General, then, argued that the concept of repugnancy,
as contemplated in Article 254 of the Constitution of India, is actual and factual repugnancy as
between the statutes of the Parliament and the State. According to him, unless there is a
Parliamentary legislation, rules or statutory orders issued by the Parliament to which the State
legislation is in direct conflict, being repugnant and the two legislations, one made by Parliament
and the other by a State Legislature, cannot Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 29 -
stand together, the legislative act of the State cannot be questioned. We regret our inability to accept
this proposition, for, this has been clearly considered and answered by two Constitution Benches
judgments of the Supreme Court.
42. We may, first, refer to the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Hingir-Rampur Coal Co.
Ltd. and others Vs. The State of Orissa and others (AIR 1961 Supreme Court 459). Here, the
question for consideration was the challenge to the validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development
Fund Act, 1952, the State enactment, the validity of which was challenged, as being repugnant to the
Central legislation, being Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948. The Central
Act had declaration in terms of Entry 54 List I, which is similar to Entry 52 List I. What their
Lordships held, in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the report, being relevant, are reproduced hereinbelow:
"23. ..........If Parliament by its law has declared that regulation and development of
mines should in public interest be under the control of the Union to the extent of
such declaration the jurisdiction of the State Legislature is excluded. In other words,
if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by Parliament as
required by Entry 54, and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the
impugned Act, the impugned Act would be ultra vires, not because of any repugnance
between the two statutes but Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 30 -
because the State Legislature had no jurisdiction to pass the law........
24. ....... Section 6 of the Act, however, empowers the Central Government to make
rules by notification in the official gazette for the conservation and development of
minerals. Section 6(2) lays down several matters in respect of which rules can be
framed by the Central Government. This power is, however, without prejudice to the
generality of powers conferred on the Central Government by S.6(1). Amongst the
matters covered by S. 6(2) is the levy and collection of royalties, fees or taxes in
respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated or collected. It is true that no rules
have in fact been framed by the Central Government in regard to the levy and
collection of any fees; but, in our opinion, that would not make any difference.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 21
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
............................... Therefore, if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of
providing for the conservation and development of minerals, and if it contains the
requisite declaration, then it would not be competent to the State Legislature to pass
an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration. In order that
the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or
enforced; ...................... In such a case the test must be whether the legislative
declaration covers the field or not."
(Emphasis is added)
43. We may, now, refer to the case of State of Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 31 -
Orissa Vs. M.A. Tulloch & Co., (AIR 1964 Supreme Court 1284), which was, again, a case dealing
with Entry 54 List I. The contention of the State is noted in paragraph 10. We would be concerned
with the first and the second question so framed being (i) that the object and purpose of the State
Act and its provisions were quite different and distinguished from the object and purpose of the
Central Act with the result that the two enactments could validly co-exists, since they covered
different fields and, (ii) even if the Central Act covers the same field, there would be no conflict
unless rules were made effective and operative under the Central Legislation covering the field
occupied by the State Act. The contention of the respondent, as noted in paragraph 11 of the report,
was that the extent of parliamentary law had to be taken from the declaration made about its
expediency in terms of Entry 54 List I. In paragraph 13 of the report, the contention of the State,
with reference to the decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji (supra) and, in particular, to the statement therein
that the possibility of an order under Section 18 G being issued by the Central Government could not
be enough, was that the existence of such an order would be the essential pre-requisite before any
repugnancy could even arise. The Court rejected the contention as noted in paragraph 14 of the
reports and held that the law had been settled, in Hingir-Rampur Coal Patna High Court CWJC
No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 32 -
Co. (supra), the relevant observations, appearing at paragraph 14, read as follows:
"14. ...... In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules
should be made or enforced. All that this required is a declaration by Parliament that
it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines
under the control of the Union. In such a case, the test must be whether the
legislative declaration covers the field or not."
(Emphasis is supplied)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 22
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
44. Their Lordships further held, in paragraph 15 of Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. (supra), thus:
"15. ......The test of two legislation containing contradictory provisions is not,
however, the only criterion of repugnancy, for, if a competent legislature, with a
superior efficacy, expressly or impliedly, evinces by its legislation an intention to
cover the whole field, the enactments of the other legislature, whether passed before
or after, would be overborne on the ground of repugnance. Where such is the
position, the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of
provisions of the two statues, but by the mere existence of the two pieces of
legislation........"
(Emphasis is supplied)
45. It may be noted that in Ishwari Khetan Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 33 -
Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court has held that Entry 52 (I) and Entry 54 (I) of the 7th
Schedule are substantially in pari materia.
46. Thus, the contention of the learned Principal Additional Advocate General has twice been
rejected by the Constitution Bench, both with regard to necessity of subordinate legislation and the
concept of repugnancy. [See Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. (supra) and M.A. Tulloch & Co. (supra)].
47. Then, the learned Principal Additional Advocate General referred to the case of Ishwari Khetan
Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. (supra). In this case, which is a Constitution Bench judgment as well, the
question was with regard to the validity of U.P. Sugar (Undertaking Acquisition) Act, 1971. One of
the main grounds of challenge was that this legislation related to sugar industry, which was a
declared industry and, as such, in view of the provisions of the IDR Act and the declaration, in terms
of Entry 52 of List I, contained therein, State had no power to legislate. The State legislation was
upheld not because of its competence under List II of the 7th Schedule, but only because it related to
legislation referable to Entry 42 List III, which was â€žacquisition and requisition of property(cid:128).
48. In our view, the decision, in Ishwari Khetan Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. (supra), does not help the State
in any Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 34 -
manner. The learned Principal Additional Advocate General also referred to the decision of Supreme
Court, in Lalta Prasad Vaish (supra), wherein a Bench of three Judge has doubted the correctness of
the seven Judge Constitution Bench decision in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra).
49. All we can say is that this is only an order of reference. In the light of the fact that Article 141 of
the Constitution of India makes the law, declared by the Supreme Court, binding on all Courts
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 23
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
within the territory of India and the seven Judge Constitution Bench decision, in Synthetics and
Chemicals Limited (supra), remains intact, to which we shall refer to, we are bound by the law as
declared by the Supreme Court, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), which, in clear and
unambiguous terms, holds that the State has no legislative competence in respect of, inter alia,
rectified spirit and/or denatured spirit, which is unfit for human consumption and, that being so,
there is no escape from the fact that the notification and the letter of the State, as impugned, are
constitutionally invalid and unenforceable.
50. At this stage, we may point out that the learned Principal Additional Advocate General has
endeavored hard to persuade us to take the view that by virtue of the decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji
case (supra), the products of fermentation industry, namely, rectified spirit and denatured Patna
High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 35 -
spirit, would fall under Entry 33 List III of the Constitution and the State would have concurrent
jurisdiction to legislate in respect of them. So far so good. But the problem, in our view, is that we
cannot ignore the fact that unlike sugar industry, the entry, in the Schedule of IDR Act, is different
there. Item No. 26 of the first schedule of the IDR Act, 1951, is exhaustive inasmuch as it reads, as
already reproduced above, thus, "26. Fermentation Industries: (1) Alcohol (2) Other products of
fermentation industries." From the fact that fermentation industry include alcohol ad other
products, the fermentation industry, coupled with the provisions of Section 18 G of the IDR Act,
clearly confer power on the Central Government to issue notified orders, provide for regulating
supply and distribution of articles relatable to Scheduled industries, trade and commerce therein.
Sub-section (2) thereof specifically refers to licence, permits, possession and consumption as also
other incidental and supplementary matters.
51. Apparently, taking help from Ch. Tika Ramji's case (supra), it was urged by the learned Principal
Additional Advocate General that the Central Government, not having notified any order under
Section 18 G, the legislative field was open and available to the State Government. This contention
has been negatived by the two Constitution Bench decisions, in Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of
2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 36 -
M.A. Tulloch (supra) and Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. (supra), wherein, having taken note of the
decision, in Ch. Tika Ramji's case (supra), their Lordships clearly held that the power being there,
the field is occupied and the rules or notifications thereunder are not necessary. Thus, the whole
argument of the learned Principal Additional Advocate General on this line cannot be accepted. The
State lacks the legislative power to legislate and, consequently, issue notifications, such as, the
impugned ones. The impugned notification as also the impugned letter are, therefore, clearly ultra
vires the Constitution.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 24
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
52. To sum up, in our judgment, the effect in so far as we are concerned, in the present case, of the
declaration contained in Section-2 of the IDR Act, 1951, in terms of Entry 52 List I of the 7th
Schedule of the Constitution, in relation to â€žfermentation industry(cid:128) with â€žalcohol(cid:128) and â€žother
products of fermentation industry(cid:128), as appearing in Entry 26 of the first Schedule of the said Act
read with Section 18 G of the said Act and the decisions, in Tika Ramji's case (supra), M.A. Tulloch
(supra) and Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. (supra), is that the field of legislation, in respect of
â€žfermentation industry(cid:128) including â€žalcohol(cid:128) and â€žother products of the fermentation industry(cid:128),
being covered by the declaration for expediency to control, would entirely fall within the legislative
field reserved Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 37 -
for the Parliament. By virtue of Article 246, State Legislature would be denuded of this entire
legislative field. Thereafter, the products of such an industry would fall within Entry 33 of List III.
Again, in view of the declaration in terms of Entry 52 List I, read with Section 18 G of the IDR Act,
the Union evincing its intention to cover the field of legislation in respect of supply, distribution,
trade and commerce of the products relatable to the Scheduled industry by virtue of Article 246 (2)
and Article 254 of the Constitution, the concurrent power of the State under Entry 33 List III stands
denuded too. The significance of Article 246 (2) is to be gathered from the use of the expressions
"Notwithstanding anything in Clause (3)", i.e., notwithstanding exclusive legislative field of State
legislature, and "subject to clause (1)", i.e., subject to exclusive field of Union Legislature, the Union
Legislature has overriding power to legislate in respect of matters enumerated in List III, the
Concurrent List denuding, thus, the State Legislature of the legislative field covered by Union
Legislation. The repugnancy, in terms of Article 254 of the Constitution of India herein, arises not
because of any conflict, actual and factual, between statutes made by the Parliament and the State,
but because State has no field left in that regard to legislate. This is what has been ultimately held, in
the seven Judge decision of the Supreme Court, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited Patna High
Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 38 -
(supra). State(cid:128)s legislative field is, then, limited by virtue of Article 246 (3) to intoxicating liquors by
virtue of Entry 8 List II only. Thus, alcohol unfit for human consumption, including spirit and
denatured spirit, which is not intoxicating liquor, remains within the exclusive domain of the Union
Parliament and State is denuded of the said field of legislation.
53. Here, we may notice yet another argument advanced by the learned Principal Additional
Advocate General. He has submitted that if this Court takes the view that State has no power to
legislate in respect of denatured spirit or rectified spirit, then, there would be no licence that could
be granted by the State in respect of rectified spirit or denatured spirit and, in absence of licence, no
trade or business could be done nor could any industry in respect thereof be set up.
54. Our simple answer is we are, now, governed by the Constitution, which gives fundamental rights
to trade or do business, unless regulated by law made by competent Legislature. If no licence is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 25
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
provided, then, its free trade. Gone are the days that no business could have been done without
licence. Even where regulation by licences is provided, it has to be tested on the touchstone of
reasonableness under Article 19 (6) and non-arbitrariness under Article 14.
55. Now, we may refer to another argument of the learned Principal Additional Advocate General on
behalf of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 39 -
State. The argument is that to prevent possible misuse of denatured spirit, which is otherwise unfit
for human consumption, in view of the prohibition policy of the Government, it became necessary to
prohibit its possession or use in any form. The answer to this is to be found in the Constitution
Bench judgment of the Supreme Court, in State of Bombay and another Vs. F.N. Balsara, (AIR 1951
Supreme Court 318). In that case, pursuant to the Bombay Prohibition Act and in furtherance of the
State policy under Article 47 of the Constitution of India, restriction was imposed on, apart from
alcoholic beverages, on all liquids consisting of or containing alcohol, which included toilet or
medicinal preparations containing alcohol. The Bombay High Court held the restrictions imposed to
be unreasonable and void, which decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court and the plea of
possibility of abuse justifying prohibition was not accepted. It is for this reason that we are of the
opinion and we have already held that the power of the State extends only to regulate such products
to prevent possible abuse; but cannot, in any case, extend to prohibition as these products are unfit
for human consumption and would neither fall within the object of Article 47 of the Constitution of
India nor would it be res extra commercium.
56. Now, before adverting to the decisions of the Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 40 -
Supreme Court in relation to alcohol, unfit for human consumption (rectified spirit/denatured
spirit), it would be necessary to note the industrial process, which is not disputed by the parties.
Distilleries are basically of two types. Molasses based or grain based. Initially, water and yeast are
added to the aforesaid to produce fermented wash, which is, then, distilled, the product obtained as
rectified spirit, containing 95% ethyl alcohol or ethanol. This is by itself unfit for human
consumption as it is. When this rectified spirit is diluted by water, we get what we called country
spirit/liquor, which is, then, potable. The second usage of rectified spirit, as such, is by adding
denaturants to it, rendering it unfit for human consumption. This denatured spirit or special
denatured spirit, both unfit for human consumption, then, go to organic chemical industries for
manufacturing various other products. Rectified spirit, which is natural alcohol, may further be
distilled for purity, which, then, produces Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), which by itself is, again, not
fit for human consumption. It is, then, used after certain dilution processes to manufacture Indian
made foreign liquor or exported from the distilleries, as such, to other units.

57. The question that arose is, as to what is the point, where State gets legislative competence and to
what extent the State(cid:128)s regulatory power or power to impose tax Patna High Court CWJC No.5795
of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 41 -
and fee extends. So far as taxes are concerned, the fields of legislation are clear. The Union
Government has taxing powers, as per taxing entries, specified in List I to the 7th Schedule to the
Constitution with residuary power in Entry 97 of List I. Entry 84 of List I is the field of legislation in
respect of excise duties; but it specifically excludes alcoholic liquor for human consumption. When
we come to List II, the taxing entry is Entry 51 List II in respect of alcoholic liquor for human
consumption. List III, the Concurrent List, does not contain any taxing entry. So far as fee is
concerned, the relevant entries are Entry 96 in List I, Entry 66 in List III and Entry 47 in the
Concurrent List; but there is Entry 8 in List II dealing specifically with intoxicant liquor including
production, manufacture, possession, transport, purchase and sale thereof.
58. We have already noted earlier that the IDR Act, 1951, was enacted by the Parliament with the
requisite declaration in terms of Entry 52 List I to the 7th Schedule to the Constitution. In the
Schedule thereto, Entry 26 is fermentation industry and it is specified as alcohol and products of
fermentation industries. Section 18 G of the IDR Act confers authority on the Central Government
to, inter alia, regulate the supply and distribution of trade and commerce in relation to any article
relatable to any scheduled industries. Sub-section (2) thereof provides for regulation by licence,
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 42 -
permit, transportation, disposal, acquisition, possession, use or consumption of any such article. It
cannot be disputed that these are very wide powers in relation to fermentation industry. The
products of such industries, including alcohol, is covered by the declaration.
59. The first decision, we would like to refer to, is the seven Judge Constitution Bench decision, in
Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra). The questions involved are noted in paragraph 2, the
relevant part thereof is reproduced hereinbelow:
"2. ......The questions with which we are mainly concerned are the following :
(i) whether the power to levy excise duty in case of industrial alcohol was with the
State legislature or the Central legislature?
(ii) what is the scope and ambit of Entry 8 List II of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution?
(iii) whether, the State Government has exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing,
selling, distributing, etc. of alcohols including industrial alcohol. In this connection,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 27
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
the extent, scope and ambit of such right or privilege has also to be examined."
60. Their Lordships(cid:128) observations made in paragraph 4, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited
(supra), being relevant, are reproduced hereinbelow:
"4. ....... It is essential that there should Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 43 -
be uniformity in the industry so that these are free from the vagaries and arbitrary
and differential treatment meted out from State to State and even in the same State
from time to time......"
61. As noted in paragraph 53 of the reports, one of the contentions of the State was that it is all sorts
of alcohol that would come within the control of the State as the State has exclusive right to deal in
liquor. The Constitution Bench, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), did not accept this
argument and held, in paragraphs 53 and 54, as follows:
"53. ........These submissions have been made on the assumption that industrial liquor
or ethyl alcohol is for human consumption. It is important to emphasise that the
expression of Constitution must be understood in its common and normal sense.
Industrial alcohol as it is, is incapable of being consumed by a normal human being.
The expression â€žconsumption(cid:128) must also be understood in the sense of direct
physical intake by human beings in this context. It is true that utilization in some
form or the other is consumption for the benefit of human beings if industrial alcohol
is utilized for production of rubber, tyres used. The utilization of those tyres in the
vehicle of man cannot in the context in which the expression has been used in the
Constitution, be understood to mean that the alcohol has been for human
consumption.
54. We have no doubt that the framers Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 44 -
of the Constitution when they used the expression â€žalcoholic liquor for human
consumption(cid:128) they meant at that time and still the expression means that liquor
which as it is, is consumable in the sense capable of being taken by human beings as
such as beverage of drinks. ......."

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 28
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
62. This is what their Lordships further held, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), at
paragraph 74:
"74. It has to be borne in mind that by common standards ethyl alcohol (which has 95
per cent) is an industrial alcohol and is not fit for human consumption. The
petitioners and the appellants were manufacturing ethyl alcohol (95 per cent) (also
known as rectified spirit) which is an industrial alcohol. ISI specification has divided
ethyl alcohol (as known in the trade) into several kinds of alcohol. Beverage and
industrial alcohols are clearly and differently treated.
Rectified spirit for industrial purposes is defined as "spirit purified by distillation having a strength
not less than 95 per cent of volume by ethyl alcohol". Dictionaries and technical books would show
that rectified spirit (95 per cent) is an industrial alcohol and is not potable as such. It appears,
therefore, that industrial alcohol which is ethyl alcohol (95 per cent) by itself is not only non-potable
but is highly toxic. The range of spirits of potable alcohol is from country spirit to whisky and the
ethyl alcohol content varies between 19 to Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 45 -
about 43 per cent. These standards are according to the ISI specifications. In other words, ethyl
alcohol (95 per cent) is not alcoholic liquor for human consumption but can be used as raw material
input after processing and substantial dilution in the production of whisky, gin, country liquor, etc.
In many decisions, it was held that rectified spirit is not alcohol fit for human consumption......."
(Emphasis is added)
63. Their Lordships answered the question with regard to the scope of Article 47 of the Constitution
of India and clearly held, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), that Article 47 would cover
only intoxicant drinks. Their Lordships further elaborated this in paragraph 80, which reads thus:
"80. It was submitted that the activity in potable liquor which was regarded safe and
exclusive right of the State in the earlier judgments dealing with the potable liquor
were sought to be justifiable under the police power of the State, that is, the power to
preserve public health, morals, etc. This reasoning can never apply to industrial
alcohol manufactured by industries which are to be developed in the public interest
and which are being encouraged by the State. In a situation of this nature, it is
essential to strike a balance and in striking the balance, it is difficult to find any
justification for any theory of any exclusive right of a State to deal with Patna High
Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 46 -
industrial alcohol......."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 29
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
64. Their Lordships, then, in paragraph 85 of the reports, as quoted hereunder, considered the IDR
Act and this is what their Lordships held:
"85. After the 1956 amendment to the IDR Act bringing alcohol industries (under
fermentation industries) as Item 26 of the First Schedule to IDR Act the control of
this industry has vested exclusively in the Union. Thereafter, licences to manufacture
both potable and non- potable alchohol is vested in the Central Government.
Distilleries are manufacturing alcohol under the central licences under IDR Act. No
privilege for manufacture even if one existed, has been transferred to the distilleries
by the State. The State cannot itself manufacture industrial alcohol without the
permission of the Central Government. The States cannot claim to pass a right which
they do not possess. Nor can the States claim exclusive right to produce and
manufacture industrial alcohol which are manufactured under the grant of licence
from the Central Government. Industrial alcohol cannot upon coming into existence
under such grant be amenable to States(cid:128) claim of exclusive possession of privilege.
The State can neither rely on Entry 8 of List II nor Entry 33 of List III as a basis for
such a claim. The State cannot claim that under Entry 33 of List III, it can regulate
industrial alcohol as a product of the scheduled industry, because the Union, under
Section Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 47 -
18-G of the IDR Act, has evinced clear intention to occupy the whole field......"
65. From the decision, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), what can safely be gathered is
that the Union, having, in exercise of power under Section 18 G of the IDR Act, evinced its clear
intention to occupy the whole filed of fragmentation industries, the State cannot impose any
prohibition on the manufacturing and trading of industrial alcohol, though it may have, in respect of
non- potable alcohol or industrial alcohol, regulatory power so that non-potable alcohol is not
misused or used as potable alcohol. This aspect becomes more than evident, when we come to the
observations made, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), at paragraph 86, in relation to
non-potable alcohol, which read as follows:
"86. The position with regard to the control of alcohol industry has undergone
material and significant change after the amendment of 1956 to the IDR Act. After
the amendment, the State is left with only the following powers to legislate in respect
of alcohol:
(a) ......
(b) It may lay down regulations to ensure that non-potable alcohol is not diverted and
misused as a substitute for potable alcohol..........."

M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
- 48 -
66. From the decision of the Constitution Bench, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), it is,
now, undisputedly, clear that in spite of the fact that rectified spirit could, later, be converted into,
and used as, potable spirit, it cannot be termed as alcohol fit for human consumption. Thus, once
denaturants are added to rectified spirit, it renders it permanently unfit for human consumption
and both, spirit and denatured spirit, are not within the legislative competence available to the State
except for the purpose of exercising regulatory power.
67. Next, we may refer to the case of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited (supra). A similar dispute was,
again, raised and this is what their Lordships held, in paragraph 22, of the reports:
"22. Article 246 gives to Parliament exclusive power to make laws with respect to the
matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule. Entry 84 of List I and Entry 51
of List II were construed by this Court in Synthetics case to hold that Parliament
alone has the exclusive power to legislate and levy excise tax in respect of industrial
alcohol. It is unnecessary to refer to the law with regard to the comparative
competence of the Union and the States with regard to levy of excise, regulation and
control of industrial alcohol prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench in
Synthetics. Whatever the law was earlier, the Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of
2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 49 -
decision in Synthetics now holds the
field......"
(Emphasis is supplied)
68. Situated thus, it becomes transparent that the decision of the Constitution Bench,
in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), is binding on all the Courts and is,
therefore, binding on this Court too.
69. It appears that a question was raised that as industrial alcohol is the basis for
manufacturing alcoholic liquor, State would have the jurisdiction. The reply, which
appears in paragraph 23 of Vam Organic Chemicals Limited (supra), reads as follows
:
"23. The principle was succinctly reiterated in State of U.P. v. Modi Distillery where it
was said that the State(cid:128)s power to levy excise duty was limited to alcoholic liquor for
human consumption and that the framers of the Constitution, when they used the
expression "alcohol liquors for human consumption", meant, and the expression still
means, that liquor which, as it is, is consumable in the sense that it is capable of
being taken by human beings as such as a beverage or drink. ...Dictionaries and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 31
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
technical books showed that rectified spirit (95 per cent) was an industrial alcohol
and not potable as such....Therefore even if ethyl alcohol (95 per cent) could be used
as a raw material or input, after processing and substantial dilution, in the
production of whisky, gin, country liquor etc. Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of
2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 50 -
nevertheless, it was not "intoxicating liquor" which expression meant only that liquor
which was consumable by human beings as it was.
Thus the State cannot legislate on industrial alcohol despite the fact that such
industrial alcohol has the potential to be used to manufacture alcoholic liquor."
(Emphasis is added)
70. From the observations made above, in Vam Organic Chemicals Limited (supra), it becomes
more than abundantly clear that the State cannot legislate on industrial alcohol, though the
industrial alcohol has the potential for use in manufacturing alcoholic liquor.
71. Then, we may refer to the decision of Mohan Meakin Limited (supra), where, once again, similar
dispute arose. The question for consideration is to be found in paragraph 10 of the reports and this
is what their Lordships held, in paragraphs 24, 25 and 26:
"24. The State has to make distinction between a malt spirit of overproof strength
and potable liquor. Entries 8, 51 and 66 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution of India confer jurisdiction upon the State only to exercise its legislative
control in respect of matters which are covered thereby. Industrial alcohol or spirit
having regard to Entry 52 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
India cannot be the subject-matter of any regulation or control by the Patna High
Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 51 -
State, it being not alcoholic liquor for human consumption. The question is well
settled in view of the decision of a seven-Judge Bench of this Court in Synthetics and
Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P.......
25. The doctrine of res extra commercium as applied by this Court in respect of
potable alcohol in its various judgments including Khoday distilleries Ltd. v. State of
Karnataka and State of Punjab v. Devans Modern Breweries Ltd. would have no
application to industrial alcohol which is produced in an industry controlled and
regulated in terms of Entry 52 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 32
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
26. If manufacture and transport of industrial alcohol and/or malt spirit of overproof
strength is not res extra commercium in view of the binding decisions of this Court in
Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd., it is axiomatic that the provisions of Article 301 of the
Constitution of India shall apply in relation to inter-State trade. The State(cid:128)s power to
exercise control of inter-State transport which is within the exclusive legislative
competence of Parliament having regard to Entry 42 of List I of the Seventh Schedule
of the Constitution of India would, thus, be limited. Its power to impose
compensatory tax and/or fee would also be limited as envisaged by Article 304 (b) of
the Constitution of India."
(Emphasis is supplied) Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 52 -
72. Thus seen, the judicial authorities and the binding precedents are galore and clear that so far as
industrial alcohol is concerned, i.e., rectified spirit and denatured spirit, it is completely covered by
the field of legislation reserved for the Union. In view of the provisions of the IDR Act and the
declaration contained therein, the power of the State is only regulatory not prohibitory. It may be
noted that once rectified spirit, which could be used for alcoholic liquor, though itself is unfit for
human consumption, is added with denaturants, it is rendered permanently unfit for human
consumption taking it away, thereafter, from State(cid:128)s legislative field.
73. To conclude, we would only refer to the decision of the Supreme Court, in Khoday Distilleries
Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in (1995) 1 Supreme Court Cases 574, and, in particular, what
their Lordships have held, in paragraph 60 of the reports, the relevant part whereof is reproduced
hereinbelow:
"60. ...........
The State cannot prohibit trade or business in medicinal and toilet preparations
containing liquor or alcohol. The State can, however, under Article 19 (6) place
reasonable restrictions on the right to trade or business I the same in the interests of
general public.
(l) Likewise, the State cannot
prohibit trade or business in industrial
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 53 -
alcohol which is not used as a beverage but used legitimately for industrial purposes.
The State, however, can place reasonable restrictions on the said trade or business in
the interests of the general public under Article 19 (6) of the Constitution.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 33
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
(m) The restrictions placed on the trade or business in industrial alcohol or in
medicinal and toilet preparations containing liquor or alcohol may also be for the
purposes of preventing their abuse or diversion for use as or in beverage."
(Emphasis is added)
74. Considered in the light of the above observations made, in Khoday Distilleries Ltd. (supra), there
can be no escape from the conclusion that State cannot prohibit trade and commerce in industrial
alcohol although, as already indicated above, State can place reasonable restrictions on such trade or
commerce in the interest of general public under Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India. Logically
extended, one cannot escape from holding, and we do hold, that neither the impugned notification,
dated 04.02.2016, nor the impugned letter, dated 17.03.2016, has any legal sanctity and validity
much less enforceability.
75. There remains yet some subsidiary issues. The first is with regard to the notification, dated
04.02.2016, insofar as compulsory destruction of denatured spirit or bye- Patna High Court CWJC
No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 54 -
product by distilleries has been ordered. These are commercial products of an industrial unit, they
are industrial alcohol. Apart from the State(cid:128)s lacking the legislative jurisdiction in respect thereof,
the compulsory destruction would amount to its confiscation. It is commercial product, having
commercial value, notification by the executive would not be law or procedure established by law as
contemplated under Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, for, any deprivation of property, in
terms of Article 300-A, has to be by law. A notification issued, not under any law, cannot take away
property rights even though it is not a fundamental right. It is constitutionally protected right in
terms of Article 300-A. There is no gainsaying as urged by the learned Principal Additional Advocate
General that as liquor for human consumption has been banned, concept of confiscation could not
apply. Denatured spirit is legitimately produced as a commercial commodity and the State has no
competence to ban it. Thus, on this count also, the impugned notification, dated 04.02.2016, or the
impugned letter, dated 17.03.2016, cannot be sustained.
76. We may usefully refer to the decision of the Supreme Court, in K.T. Plantation Private Limited
and another Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in (2011) 9 Supreme Court Cases 1, wherein scope of
Article 300-A and Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 55 -
the necessity to pay compensation, which must be just, fair and reasonable, has been discussed, in
absence whereof, even the law, made by the legislature, cannot be upheld valid.
77. The last question is as to whether any restriction on the fundamental right to carry on trade or
business can be imposed by executive fiat or mere executive notification or letter. The straight
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 34
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
answer must be no. Once it is accepted that right to manufacture industrial alcohol and to deal with
industrial alcohol is a right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g), where Article 47 of the Constitution
has no application, the rights, under Article 19 (1) (g), can only be restricted or regulated in a
reasonable manner by law [Article 19 (6)]. Article 13 of the Constitution clearly provides that any
law, which is inconsistent to the rights contained in Part III, would be void. The law, in this context,
could be the "law" made by the legislature or under authority of the legislature and not by executive
fiat or executive instructions. We may only quote what was said, in paragraph 21, by a Division
Bench of this Court, in State of Bihar and others Vs. M/s Oswal Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd. and
others, (AIR 2001 Patna 184), which is reproduced hereunder:
"21. The law is well settled by catena of judgments of the Supreme Court that
restrictions to the freedom guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution must be
by a law or order having statutory force and not by executive Patna High Court CWJC
No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 56 -
instructions."
78. We may further, with regard to the above, refer to the decision of the Supreme Court, in State of
Bihar and others Vs. Project Uchcha Vidya, Sikshak Sangh and others, reported in (2006) 2
Supreme Court Cases 545, and, in particular, what was held by their Lordships, in paragraph 69 of
the report, which read as follows:
"69. The right to manage an institution is also a right to property. In view of a
decision of an eleven-Judge Bench of this Court in T.M.A. Pai foundation v. State of
Karnataka establishment and management of an educational institution has been
held to be a part of fundamental right being a educational institution has been held to
be a part of fundamental right being a right of occupation as envisaged under Article
19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. A citizen cannot be deprived of the said right except in
accordance with law. The requirement of law for the purpose of clause (6) of Article
19 of the Constitution can by no stretch of imagination be achieved by issuing a
circular or a policy decision in terms of Article 162 of the Constitution or otherwise.
Such a law, it is trite, must be one enacted by the legislature."
(Emphasis is supplied)
79. Thus seen, both, the impugned notification, dated 04.02.2016, and the impugned letter, dated
17.03.2016, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 57 -
cannot be held to be valid as they would clearly be unreasonable restrictions falling foul with Article
19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.

80. In the last writ petition, being C.W.J.C. No.10598 of 2016, which, as noted above, has been filed
by a grain based industry, the grievance of the petitioner is that solely because it has dared to file
another writ petition, being C.W.J.C. No.7634 of 2016, challenging the notification of the State
Government, dated 04.02.2016, with regard to compulsory destruction of denatured spirit, the
petitioner is being deprived of export permit in respect of its main product ENA, which is unfit, as
such, for human consumption. The petitioner has brought on record the counter affidavit of the
State filed in the writ petition, being C.W.J.C. No.7634 of 2016, wherein, State has admitted, in
paragraph 15, that as other distilleries had not challenged the decision of the Government and were
acting pursuant to directions and orders of the Government, it was thought necessary to grant
permit to them for export of ENA. It admitted that as some breweries challenged the prohibition
policy, the Government decided to withhold the export permit. In paragraph 16 of the counter
affidavit, as appended, this is what the Government(cid:128)s stand is, the relevant part whereof is
reproduced hereunder:
"16. ........ Since, the matter relating to destruction of denatured spirit and other allied
Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 58 -
matters were sub judiced in C.W.J.C. No.7634 of 2014, it was found not desirable to
issue necessary permit for export of ENA in favour of petitioner till the final disposal
of the said writ petition."
81. The petitioner has also annexed a copy of the export permit granted to another distillery,
namely, M/s S.C.I. India Limited, by the State, as late as on 22.06.2016.
82. It was, accordingly, submitted that the sole basis, on which the petitioner(cid:128)s industry is virtually
being driven to closure by the State, by not permitting to export its main product, ENA, which is
neither taxable nor any export permit fee is levied in the State, is on account of the fact that the
petitioner has chosen to challenge the authority of the State in respect of compulsory destruction of
denatured spirit. This is, according to the petitioner, nothing, but an attempt to thwart or stifle bona
fide litigation by mala fide means, which is, in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court, in
Pratap Singh and another Vs. Gurubaksh Singh, (AIR 1962 Supreme Court 1172) clearly a criminal
contempt.
83. We asked the State to file that a counter affidavit. The counter affidavit, so filed, clearly
admitted, again, in paragraph 9, that as the matter in relation to destruction of denatured spirit was
sub judice, it was decided, in good faith, not to issue export permits for ENA to the petitioner,
awaiting the decision of the Court on petitioner(cid:128)s Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016

M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
writ petition, being C.W.J.C. No.7634 of 2016. In paragraph 16 of the counter affidavit, the State has
admitted that it has granted export permit in favour of S.C.I. India Limited, which had not litigated
any matter in this Court.
84. A supplementary affidavit was, then, filed by the writ petitioner bringing on record the notings
of the Principal Secretary of the Department, clearly showing that it is only because this petitioner
has chosen to challenge the Government policy, it is being deprived of the export permit. This was in
spite of recommendation of the other authorities that export permit be granted.
85. The matter was, then, taken up by the Court on 05.08.2016, where we took a serious note of the
events, which were undermining the authority of the Court and was destructive of the principles of
judicial review, by trying to punish a person, who comes to the Court for redressal of his grievances.
We adjourned the matter for State to reconsider the matter.
86. From further supplementary affidavit that has, now, been filed along with an application made,
on behalf of the writ petitioner, for amendment of additional prayer, order of the Government, dated
06.08.2016, has been brought on record to show that after the matter was adjourned by the Court,
State, now, has issued direction that all companies, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 60 -
which manufacture Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) including beer as also ENA, would be
required to give a bank guarantee of Rs. one crore in favour of the Government. By amendment
petition, the authority of the State to demand bank guarantee, valid for a period of one year of an
amount of Rs. one crore, from exporters of ENA has been challenged. We have allowed the
amendment. The prayer, sought for by the amendment, is to invalidate the said condition in so far
as ENA export is concerned.
87. A counter affidavit has, now, been filed by the State stating that in the month of February, 2016,
a truck, loaded with beer, in course of transit from Bihar to State of Jharkhand, was hijacked in
Aurangabad district. Now, with prohibition having been introduced with effect from 05.04.2016,
apprehensions are greater with regard to misuse or looting of ENA. It is in the light of this that the
companies, which have to export IMFL or ENA, are required to furnish bank guarantee of Rs. one
crore. It is not that the petitioner alone has been asked to do so. Enclosed are two letters of the State
Government, dated 04.07.2016, and, the later part of this impugned letter, dated 06.08.2016. It is
further submitted that all other distilleries are complying with the order of furnishing bank
guarantee and, in view of statutory rules made by the State, under Section 89 of the Excise Act,

1915, vide notification No.471-F, dated 15.01.1990, Rule 10 B (1), which deals with export of foreign
liquor to other provinces in India, there being provisions for bond, the demand of bank guarantee is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 37
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
valid.
88. We have considered the matter. The first thing we would like to point out is that ENA was never
considered as intoxicant, fit for human consumption. State has no jurisdiction nor has the State ever
sought to exercise any jurisdiction to tax the production or sale of ENA. There is no excise duty
liability. There was a nominal export pass fee. This apart, the State(cid:128)s stand is, that after imposition
of prohibition, as a purported incentive to manufacturers and exporters of ENA, even this export
pass fee has been waived. Thus, the State is not to gain any revenue out of ENA; then, why this bank
guarantee of Rs.one crore, which would, undoubtedly, require the industry to make substantial
deposits with the bank as collateral to cover the bank guarantee causing it great financial strain. This
is understandable for IMFL or beer as they are revenue earners for State.
89. Mr. Satyabir Bharti, learned Counsel for the petitioners, further points out, that already the
entire assets of the distillery and the distillery itself are virtually pledged to the State and that the
only reason for imposing such a condition is to justify its otherwise mala fide action. The
submission, on Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 62 -
behalf of the petitioners, as noted above, cannot be said to be unfounded.
90. The State, first, stated that, in April, 2016, a truck of beer was hijacked. Who is the loser would
be the question? The excise duties and taxes were paid and it is the brewery that lost its stocks, not
the State. Be that as it may, in spite of this, after 05.04.2016, as late as on 26.06.2016, other
distilleries were issued export permit for ENA, but on the spacious plea that petitioner had
challenged government Notification, dated 02.04.2016, with regard to denatured spirit, the export
permit for ENA was denied to the petitioners. Thereafter, on 04.07.2016, the condition of bank
guarantee of Rs. one crore was imposed only in relation to beer industry. As apparent from the
State(cid:128)s own counter affidavit, which is understandable, because beer is a State excisable
commodity; but, then, only when, on 05.08.2016, we adjourned the matter, taking a very serious
view of the events, on 06.08.2016, general direction was issued imposing condition of bank
guarantee of Rs. one crore on all exporters of IMFL, beer and ENA.
91. We may note that, now, probably, there is no IMFL manufacturer left in Bihar. The justification
is Rule 10 B (1) of the Rules, as noted above. A plain reading of the Rule shows that it applies only to
export of foreign liquor, which is Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 63 -
an excisable commodity in this State, Rule 10B(1) has no application, nor can it have any
application, to non-potable industrial alcohol like ENA.
92. We may, now, note the argument of the learned Principal Additional Advocate General repeated
once again, as noted and rejected earlier, that as spirit means any liquor containing alcohol [Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 38
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
2 (19)], liquor includes spirit [Section 2 (14)] and intoxicant for the purpose of the Act means any
liquor [Section 2 (12a)], ENA is an intoxicant and, therefore, State has jurisdiction over ENA and it
can impose such a condition to safeguard against loss of ENA in transit.
93. Firstly, we have already answered the question whether State has jurisdiction over ENA or not. It
has been settled by the Supreme Court, in Synthetics and Chemicals Limited (supra), that ENA is
unfit for human consumption, it is industrial alcohol and State cannot tax it. Then, the question is, if
the State has no pecuniary interest in ENA unlike IMFL or beer, and so was understood by the State
itself, till we adjourned the matter, on 05.08.2016, then, why, on 06.08.2016, the condition of bank
guarantee, as required for IMFL and beer, was extended to ENA, which was never there earlier. Rule
10 B (1), which is a pre-Constitutional Rule, cannot be extended to non-potable liquor like ENA.
94. We are, thus, constrained to hold, especially, Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of 2016
dt.30-09-2016
- 64 -
in view of the facts and situations noted above, that the condition of bank guarantee, as imposed for
facilitating exports, is a colourable exercise of power, only to spite the industry, which has
challenged the authority of the State and, to justify its, otherwise, mala fide and contemptuous
action. We will deal with this aspect of contempt, as we prima facie opine that the defence is only a
pretence to avoid consequences, separately in an independent proceeding to be instituted. We
would, accordingly, in this regard, hold that the asking for bank guarantee as a condition for
issuance of export permit, for export of ENA, is wholly illegal and not to be enforced. We would
further direct that as the industry is at a standstill, for, they are unable to sell and dispatch their
products, the State government shall, immediately, issue export permits without the onerous
condition of bank guarantee in respect of ENA.
95. In the end, we enquired from the learned Principal Additional Advocate General as to under
what authority were the impugned notification and the letter issued or under what law or with
regard to what law as made by the legislature? All that the learned Principal Additional Advocate
General could say was that the impugned notification was issued pursuant to the New Excise Policy,
2015, of the State government and the impugned letter is also pursuant to the Patna High Court
CWJC No.5795 of 2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 65 -
said policy. We are surprised how such action could have at all been taken, because policy by itself is
not law. Merely because the State has legislative competence, executive instruction, in absence of
law as made by the legislature, impinging upon fundamental rights, cannot be issued.
96. Thus, we have no difficulty in noting that the impugned notification, dated 04.02.2016, and the
impugned, letter dated 17.03.2016, as referred to above, to the extent it is challenged, are wholly
ultra vires the Constitution and ultra vires the powers of the State and its executive. They are,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91417082/ 39
M/S Samrat Laboratories vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 30 September, 2016
accordingly, declared null and void and are quashed as such. It is held that the impugned
notification, dated 04.07.2016, and the impugned letter, dated 06.08.2016, are not enforceable.
Consequently, the distilleries are not required to destroy the stocks of denatured spirit or what is
produced by them and would be entitled to sell the same and the State cannot restrict the sale,
except in accordance with law, as we have indicated above. Also the decision, not to grant and/or
renew licences for use, possession and sale of denatured spirit cannot be upheld. The State cannot,
therefore, cancel, refuse to grant or renew any licence for manufacture of industrial alcohol or
denatured spirit. Consequently, the District Collectors would be obliged to renew/grant the same, as
was being done in the past, and the authorities concerned are Patna High Court CWJC No.5795 of
2016 dt.30-09-2016
- 66 -
restrained from interfering with the said business, trade and industry.
97. The writ applications are accordingly allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.
