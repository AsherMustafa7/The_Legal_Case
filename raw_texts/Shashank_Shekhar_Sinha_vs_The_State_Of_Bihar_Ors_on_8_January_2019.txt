CORAM: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE

ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 08-01-2019 Heard Sri Rajeev Roy, learned
counsel for the petitioner, and Sri Samir Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the High Court
holding brief of Sri Piyush Lal and Sri Mrigendra Kumar, learned counsel for the State of Bihar.
The challenge raised in this petition is to the refusal of the High Court to entertain the
representation filed by the petitioner in respect of the discrepancies said to exist in the evaluation of
Theory Paper-I of the main written examination of District Judge (Entry Level), Direct from Bar
Exam-2016. The Patna High Court CWJC No.17768 of 2018 dt.08-01-2019 contention raised is that
the trend of awarding marks by the examiner in the answer book clearly indicates that the examiner
had awarded higher marks, but while totalling the same, some interpolations have been made on the
first page, as a result whereof, the marks of the petitioner as awarded have been substantially
reduced and, even otherwise, the manner of marking also suffers from discrepancies. For this, it has

Shashank Shekhar Sinha vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 8 January, 2019
been urged that if the marking of the evaluator and the marks awarded are carefully perused
particularly with regard to question no.1(b), question no.10, question no.11, question no.14(a) and
question no.22, then it would be apparent that the discrepancies clearly exist and the manner in
which the marks have been awarded leave no room for doubt that it has been done casually. Apart
from the evaluation being decrepit, the ultimate awarding of marks also suffers from an incorrect
calculation.
On the said premise, learned counsel submits that if the discrepancies are clearly established, then
the answer book requires a re-checking and re-evaluation.
The petitioner applied for the photostat copies of the answer book that was given to him, whereafter
he filed his representation and the High Court on the administrative side on 11th July, 2018 resolved
as follows :-
Patna High Court CWJC No.17768 of 2018 dt.08-01-2019 "The Committee
considered the representations dated 24.05.2018, 08.06.2018 and letter dated
11.07.2018 of Sri Shashank Shekhar Sinha, Sri Daya Shankar Prasad Gupta and Sri
Kumar Keshav respectively, the unsuccessful candidates of District Judge (Entry
Level), Direct from Bar Exam-2016, praying therein for rechecking/scrutiny of their
answer sheets. The Committee found that no answer is left unevaluated nor there is
any variation in marks on re-totaling. Further, there is no provision of re- checking or
re-evaluation of the answer-sheets and, thus, the representations aforestated are
rejected".
Not being satisfied, the appellant, after having obtained the photostat copies of the
answer book, has filed this writ petition contending that the evaluation as well as the
calculation of the answers by the examiner being deficient the relief prayed for
deserves to be granted.
Learned counsel for the respondent-High Court and the State have urged that since
re-checking and re-evaluation are not permissible under the rules, therefore, even
otherwise, no such relief can be granted and apart from this a counter affidavit has
been filed stating therein that the discrepancies as pointed out by the petitioner are
not borne out from the record. It is urged that the contentions raised, therefore, fall
beyond the pale of judicial Patna High Court CWJC No.17768 of 2018 dt.08-01-2019
review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the writ petition does not
deserve to be entertained.
A rejoinder affidavit to the counter has been filed rebutting the claim set up in the
writ petition and contending that the counter affidavit does not disclose any valid
reason even while rejecting the representation nor does it attend to the grievances as
raised specifically on behalf of the petitioner, particularly with regard to the mode
and manner of evaluation of the answers referred to hereinabove in Theory Paper-I of
the 2016 examinations.

Shashank Shekhar Sinha vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 8 January, 2019
We have considered the submissions raised and we have also perused the photostat
copy of the answer book that has been filed along with the writ petition. As against
the questions that have been referred to by the petitioner, marks have been awarded.
As against Answer No.10, the figure of 12 has been encircled below the answer but the
same does not appear to be the marks awarded inasmuch as the question itself is of 7
marks. So far as Answer No.12 is concerned, 4 marks have been awarded.
In this view of the matter, if the marks are calculated as awarded, then there does not
appear to be any discrepancy either in the totalling nor does there appear to be any
discrepancy in the award of marks. Learned counsel has insisted that certain answers
Patna High Court CWJC No.17768 of 2018 dt.08-01-2019 bear the endorsement of a
circle without any marks endorsed therein and, therefore, the same amounts to
having not been evaluated. In our opinion, the aforesaid inference is incorrect,
inasmuch as such as, the answers have been crossed and, it appears, zero marks have
been awarded.
In the light of what has been concluded hereinabove, the discrepancies pointed out by
the learned counsel for the petitioner do not appear to be borne out from the record
and, consequently, the decision of the High Court to reject the representation of the
petitioner also does not suffer any legal infirmity.
The writ petition lacks merit. The same is dismissed.
