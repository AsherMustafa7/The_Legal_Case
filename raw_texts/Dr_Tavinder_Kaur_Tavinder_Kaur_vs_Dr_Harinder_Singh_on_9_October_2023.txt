JUSTICE M.S. RAMAN
ORDER
09.10.2023 Order No.
08. I.A. No.5252 of 2023 and W.A. No.1007 of 2023
1. This matter is taken up through hybrid mode.
2. This is an application filed by the Respondent contending that the writ appeal is not maintainable
on the plea that the interlocutory order passed by the Family Court was challenged in the writ
petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and against the order passed in the writ
petition, the present writ appeal has been filed.
3. To substantiate his contention, Sri P.K. Nayak, learned counsel appearing for the Respondent has
placed reliance on the decisions of the apex Court in Sh. Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji v. State of
Gujarat and others, AIR 2015 SC 3623 = 2015 (II) OLR (SC) 509 and Radhey Shyam and another v.
Chhabi Nath and others, AIR 2015 SC 3269 = (2015) 5 SCC 423 = 2015 (I) OLR (SC) 804, ratio of
which has been followed by the Division Bench of this Court in Jyotshna Mohapatra v. State of
Odisha, 2018 (II) OLR 1, in which one of us (Dr. B.R. Sarangi, ACJ.) was a Member.
4. In view of aforesaid facts and circumstances, Mr. Sanjeev Udgata, learned counsel appearing for
the Appellant contends that the Family Court is not a court in the eye of law and, therefore, against
the said order of the Family Court, the Appellant had approached this Court by filing writ petition
and against the order passed by the learned Single Judge, he has filed the present writ appeal. The

Dr. Tavinder Kaur @ Tavinder Kaur vs Dr. Harinder Singh on 9 October, 2023
memo of objection to the I.A. has been filed by the Appellant.
5. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on going through the records, it appears that the
decisions of the apex court in Sh. Jogendrasinhji Vijaysinghji (supra) and Radhey Shyam (supra)
has been followed by this Court in Jyotshna Mohapatra (supra), and it is held that in an intra-Court
appeal, order passed by the Civil Judge is only amenable to be scrutinized by the High Court in
exercise of jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. Once it is exclusively
assailable under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, no intra-Court appeal is maintainable.
Therefore, jurisdiction under Article 227 is distinct from the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution. A letters patent appeal or an intra-Court appeal in respect of an order passed by the
learned Single Judge dealing with the order arising out of proceeding from the Civil Court would not
lie before the Division Bench. Reference can also be made to Rabindranath @ Rabindranath Jena v.
Bijaya Kumar Bhuyan, 2016 (II) ILR-CUT 28, Mahammed Saud v. Dr. (Maj) Shaikh Mahfooz, AIR
2009 Ori 46 (FB) affirmed by the Supreme Court reported at (2010) 13 SCC
517.
6. The High Court in exercise of the power under Article 226 of the Constitution exercises original
jurisdiction, though the said jurisdiction shall not be confused with the ordinary civil jurisdiction of
the High Court. Jurisdiction, though original in character as contrasted with its appellate and
revisional jurisdictions, is exercisable throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises
jurisdiction and may, for convenience, be described as extraordinary original jurisdiction and
jurisdiction under Article 227 is distinct from jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and,
therefore, a letters patent appeal or an intra-Court appeal in respect of an order passed by the
learned Single Judge dealing with an order arising out of a proceeding from a Civil Court would not
lie before the Division Bench. Therefore, no letters patent appeal would be maintainable.
7. In view of the above position, since the order has been passed by the Family Court and the same
has been tested by learned Single Judge and against the said order of the learned Single Judge, the
present writ appeal is not maintainable, in view of the principle laid down by the apex Court
followed by this Court in the decisions cited supra.
8. In view of such position, this Court is not inclined to entertain the present appeal, as the same is
not maintainable. Accordingly, the I.A. stands allowed. Consequentially, the writ appeal stands
dismissed. The interim order passed earlier stands vacated.
