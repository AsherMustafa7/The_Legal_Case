Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 2
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
that of a third country/foreign origin but according to the learned
counsel for the petitioner, the seizure list nowhere discloses the
name of the country from which the goods have been originated.
Further that how the customs officials formed a belief that the
goods were of foreign origin.
4. Learned counsel submits that the goods have been
seized with reference to Notification No. 09 /1996-Cus (NT) dated
22.01.1996
issued under Section 11 of the Customs Act read with Section 3(2) of the Foreign Trade
(Development and Regulation) Act, 1992. The notification prohibits the imports of goods from
Nepal which has been exported to Nepal from other country in India.
5. Learned counsel assailed the seizure on the ground that seizure of goods and conveyance has been
done without having any reason to believe that the conveyance was carrying on any smuggled goods
or the impugned goods were in any way liable for confiscation under the Customs Act, 1962. He has
referred Section 106 of the Customs Act, 1962 to show that the power for search of conveyance
would be available only in case the proper officer has reason to believe that any vehicle is being used
in the smuggling of any goods and in the carrying of any goods which has been smuggled. It is
submitted that the Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 respondent authorities
have asserted that they had specific information received from their Additional Commissioner over
telephone that the Betel Nuts of third country or origin were being transported from Gauhati to
Karnataka and getting upon the said information the Truck was intercepted. It is submitted that
there was no authentic information that the respondent authorities which could be deemed to be
actionable and upon which they proceeded to search of truck in question. It is further submitted that
the internal information, if any, was required to be recorded in Form DRI-1. It's authentication were
required to be verified and then only action should have been taken.
6. Further learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the description given by the customs
officials that the Areca Nuts are appearing as small and round shaped and light brown in colour
which are the character of "Malasian" origin is not correct and has no basis. It is submitted that by
seeing the shape and colour of Betel Nut their country of origin cannot be determined. Further it is
submitted that even samples sent by the respondent authorities to 'ADRF' have failed to determine
it's country of origin. In this regard learned counsel refers Annexure 'R/4' and 'R/5' to the counter
affidavit.

M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
7. Further relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of Rara
Brotheres Vs.M.L. Dey reported under [2000 (126) E.L.T. 425 (425)], Angou Golmei Vs Vizovolie
Chakha Sang reported under [1996 (81) E.L.t. 440 (Pat.)] and that by the Division Bench of Bombay
High Court in the case of M.G. Abrol, Additional Collector of Customs., Bombay Vs. Amichand
Vallamji reported under [2002 (149) E.L.T. 32 (Bom.)]. Learned counsel submits that when the
respondents are not able to fulfil the legal requirement of valid search and seizure, having resorted
to the contention that the sample of seized Areca Nuts were tested and found to be unsafe for food
and human consumption and those are not confirming the standards under the Regulation No. 2.12
and 2.3.47 (5) of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards & Food Additives)
Regulations, 2011.
8. Learned counsel relied upon Section 47 of the Foods Safety and Standards Act, 2006 read with
Rule 2.4 of the Rule 2011 whereunder the Food Safety Officer has to give notice in writing about
intention to take samples to get it analyzed to the person from whom the samples are being taken. It
is submitted that the Officers of Customs have not been appointed as Food Safety Officer under the
Act and also the procedures as regards taking the Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019
dt.05-09-2019 sample under the Said Act and Rules have not been followed.
Thus, the entire procedure is without authority.
9. As regards the reliance placed upon Circular No. 03 of 2011 of the Customs dated 06.01.2011 and
Circular No. 58/2011- Customs Dated 25.10.2001 it is contended that these circulars are applicable
to imported goods prior to custom clearance. The submission is that in the instant case there is
neither any belief to show that the impugned goods are smuggled or imported nor there is anything
to show that the respondent authorities had any jurisdiction to cause "customs clearance" of the said
goods.
10. Learned counsel further relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Salsar Transport
Company Vs. The Union of India in M.J.C. No. 2185 of 2013 vide order dated 24.07.2013.
11. On the other hand learned counsel for the Union of India has contested the writ application on
the various grounds which have been taken note of by this Court in detail while considering the
connected writ application bearing C.W.J.C. No. 10109 of 2019. The contention of the learned
counsel for the Union of India has been discussed in detail in the said judgment.
The same are not being reiterated hereunder. Paragraph '8' and '9' Patna High Court CWJC No.6563
of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 of the counter affidavit are however, reproduced hereunder for a ready
reference:
"7. That to ascertain the country of origin of the seized Dried Areca Nuts, samples
were sent to- (1.) Arecanut Research & Development Foundation, Varanashi Towers,
Mission Street, Mangalore, Karnataka and (2.) Central Food Laboratory, Kolkata,
Extension Centre Raxual, Bihar.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 4
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
8. That the Arecanut Research & Development Foundation, Mangalore vide their
letter ARDF/CUS/FBG/18-19/ 1524 dated 14.02.2019 provided test report :
"The Arecanuts are of assorted in size, shape and harvested at tender stage with
different age of maturity, dehusked, boiled, light to dark brought in colour. Smoky in
taste. As the nuts are harvested in tender nut stage it is difficult to identity the
country of origin".
9. That the final conclusion is that the sample of Arecanuts provided by the Assistant Commissioner,
Office of the Assistant Commissioner, Customs (Prev.) Division, Goriyare Chowk, Forbesganj, Araria
Bihar vide letter C.No. VIII(10) 319/Cus/Seiz/DPU/FBG/18-19/1524 dated 07.02.2019 under its
seal has been tested and find that it is difficult to identify the country of origin.
10. That Central Food Laboratory, Kolkata, Extension Centre Raxaul, Bihar in vide their Certificate
No. INF/CFL/KOL/RXL/19/FEB-70 provided the test report:
"The sample of Betel Nut were tested as per Standard Food Safety norms falling
under regulation No. 2.12 & 2.3.47 (5) of Food Safety Standards (Food Products
Standards & Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 and found non-conforming to the
standards due to presence of Damaged Betel Nuts and presence of Insects. Thus the
sample is 'unsafe food' under Section 3(I)(ZZ)(ix) of Food Patna High Court CWJC
No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards &
Food Additives (FSS) Act, 2006.".
11. That to ascertain the country of origin of the seized goods, further investigation viz. verification
of buyer/seller and their actual work profile from jurisdictional Commissionerate, verification of
documents submitted by the truck driver at the time of interception of the tuck etc. are being done
by the Division office, Forbesganj."
12. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel representing the Union
of India, this Court finds that the submissions of learned counsel for the parties are identical to the
submissions raised in C.W.J.C. No. 10109 of 2019 which has been disposed of today itself. The
consideration and operative part of the judgment in C.W.J.C. No. 10109 of 2019 are quoted
hereunder:
"20.Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as for the Union of India,
this Court finds that the whole argument of the petitioner for purpose of quashing of
the seizure list revolves around the provision of Section 110 of the Customs Act.
Section 110 of the Customs Act is quoted hereunder for a ready reference:
"110. Seizure of goods, documents and things. -(1) If the proper officer has reason to
believe that any goods are liable to confiscation under this Act, he may seize such
goods :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 5

Provided that where it is not practicable to seize any such goods, the proper officer
may serve on the Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 owner of
the goods an order that he shall not remove, part with, or otherwise deal with the

soon as may be after its seizure under sub-section (1), be disposed of by the proper
officer in such manner as the Central Government may, from time to time, determine
after following the procedure hereinafter specified.
(1-B) Where any goods, being goods specified under sub-section (1-A), have been
seized by a proper officer under sub-section (1), he shall prepare an inventory of such

[110-A. Provisional release of goods, documents and things seized pending adjudication.- Any
goods, documents, or things seized under section 110, pending the order of the 3[adjudicating
authority], be released to the owner on taking a bond from him in the proper form with such
security and conditions as the 3[adjudicating authority] may require.]"
21. In the facts of the present case, the counter affidavit of the respondents states that
the Cut Dried Arecanuts is of dark pink colour which are not the characteristics of
Indian origin Arecanuts because the Arecanuts of Indian origin are normally Oval in
shape. In order to ascertain the country of origin of the seized cut dried Arecanuts,
samples were sent to the two Laboratories. The test report of ARDF, Mangalore reads
as under:
" The sample of areca nuts contain very small cut pieces (Chips), boiled, dried and
coated with some colouring material. The colour is red and very shiny. It is not the
natural colour of arecanut or its extract. They suspect that the arecanut pieces are
coated with some artificial colouring materials".
22. Further the test report of the 'CFL' reported reads as under:
"The sample of Betel Nut were tested as per Standard Food Safety norms failing
under regulation No. 2.12 &
1. substituted by Act 25 of 2014,S. 78, for "Commissioner of Customs" (w.e.f.
1-10-2014).
2. Inserted by Act 29 of 2006 (w.e.f. 13-7-2006).
3. Substituted by Act 8 of 2011, S. 47, for "adjudicating officer" and "Commissioner of
Customs".
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 2.3.47 (5) of Food Safety and Standards
(Food Products Standard & Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 and found non-conforming to the
standards due to presence of Damaged Betel Nuts and Added Colouring matter. Thus the sample is
'unsafe food' under section 3(I)(ZZ)
(ix) of FSS Act, 2006".
23. The respondents have come out with a statement that in order to ascertain the country of origin
of the seized goods further investigation is going on. So far as the two test reports are concerned,
this Court finds that those are not saying about the country of origin of the Betel Nuts.
24. In the case of M/s Ayesha Exports Vs. The Union of India (C.W.J.C. No. 7589 of 2018), this
Court has recorded the views of the learned co-ordinate Bench of this Court in M.J.C. No. 2185 of
2013 which had in fact been challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 7
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
Appeal (Civil) No. CC7331 of 2014 but the same was dismissed on 08.05.2014 keeping the question
of law open.
25. This Court reiterated that in absence of there being any standardized laboratory test for tracing
the country of origin, established under some statute and unless such Labs have been accredited by
the competent authority and that the Labs could have the scientific method to come to a conclusion
that the Betel Nut is of a particular country's origin, it would not be in the interest of justice to direct
the petitioner to pay the custom's duty.
26. This Court finds that in the present case the request of the petitioner to release the Betel Nuts
have been rejected on a totally different ground. In paragraph 26 of the counter affidavit
respondents have come out with the following statements:
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 "26. That in the view of the
statements made in paragraph no. 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61,
62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 and 68 of the writ petition under reply, it is humbly stated and
submitted that it is pertinent to mention that facts and circumstance of the instant
case are not identical to the facts and circumstances for the cases referred by the
petitioner in his application. In the instant case respondent has placed reliance upon
the test report given by the two test labs, in which it has been reported that "the
sample is 'unsafe food' for human consumption; while in any of the cases referred by
the petitioner no such report was available at that point of time. In view of the same it
would not be appropriate to release the seized goods for human consumption."
27. Learned counsel for the Union of India has placed before this Court a
Government of India's Circular No. 3 of 2011 issued by Ministry of Finance in the
Department of Revenue, Central Board of Excise and Customs on 6th January, 2011.
The Circular provides detailed guidelines for examination and testing of food items
prior to its testing and clearance by Customs Officers under the provisions of
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 ( in short 'PFA Act, 1954'). It is submitted
that in terms of the said Circular dated 6 th January, 2011, the Custom Officers are
competent to get the samples tested from the nearest Central Food Laboratory or a
Laboratory authorized for such testing by DGHS or FSSI.
Circular No. 3 of 2011 is reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference:

Subject: Import of edible / food products - regarding.
*** Sir / Madam, Attention is invited to Board Circular No.58/2001-Cus dated
25.10.2001 which provides detailed guidelines for examination and testing of food
item prior to its testing and clearance by Customs officers under the provisions of
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (PFA Act, 1954).
2. Further, in terms of Para 8 of Chapter I A (General Notes Regarding Import Policy)
of the ITC (HS) Classification of Export and Import items, import of all such
edible/food products including tea, domestic sale and manufacture of which are
governed by Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, shall be subject to all the
conditions laid down in the aforesaid Act. Import of all these products will have to
comply with the quality and packaging requirements as laid down in the Act.
Compliance of these conditions is to be ensured before allowing customs clearance of
the consignment.
3. To consolidate the laws relating to food and to provide for a systematic and
scientific development of Food Processing Industries, the government has enacted
The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act, 2006). Under the Act, the Food
Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been established to lay down
standards and regulate/monitor the manufacturing, import, processing, distribution
and sale of food. Section 97 of the FSS Act, 2006 provides that the existing Acts and
Orders relating to food items such as PFA Act, 1954; Food Products Order, 1955;
Meat Food Products Order, 1973; Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019
dt.05-09-2019 Vegetable Oil Products (Control) Order, 1947; Edible Oils Packaging
(Regulation) Order, 1988; Solvent Extracted Oil, Deoiled Meal, and Edible Flour
Control (Order), 1967; Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992 etc shall be repealed from
a date to be notified.
4. The FSSAI has taken over PHO functions at select ports such as Nava Sheva and
Mumbai with effect from 13.09.2010 with the stipulation that the existing rule and
procedures will continue to be followed without any change till FSSAI regulations are
notified. Thus, FSSAI has replaced PHO with its authorized officers at
abovementioned ports in terms of section 47 (5) of the FSS Act, 2006.
5. Difficulties have been reported to Board by certain importers regarding delay in
testing of samples and clearance of goods consequent upon implementation of FSS
Act, 2006 at select ports.
6. It is also noted that vide Policy Circular 25(RE-2003)/2002-007 dated 28.01.2004
and 37(RE-2003)/2002-2007 dated 14.06.2004, the DGFT has modified the

M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
procedure for sampling of imported edible/Food Products.
7. Accordingly, the procedure of clearance of food articles has been revisited by the
Board, and following modified procedure has been prescribed:
(a) All consignments of high risk food items, as listed in DGFT Policy Circular No.
37(RE-2003)/2002-2007 dated 14.06.2004 (as may be modified from time to time),
shall be referred to Authorised Representative of FSSAI or PHOs, as the case may be,
for testing and clearance shall be allowed only after receipt of the test report as per
the instructions contained in the Customs Circular No. 58/2001-Cus, dated
25.10.2001.
(b) All consignments of perishable items like fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, cheese,
etc., will continue to be handled in terms of the guidelines contained in Para 2.3 of
the Board's Circular No.58/2001-Customs dated 25.10.2001.
(c)In respect of food items not covered under (a) and (b) above, the following
procedure would be adopted in addition to the general checks prescribed under Para
2.1 of the Circular No. 58/2001-Cus, dated 25.10.2001:
(i)Samples would be drawn from the first five consecutive consignments of each food
item, imported by a particular importer and referred to Authorised Representative of
FSSAI or Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 PHOs, as the case
may be, for testing to ascertain the quality and health safety standards of the
consignments.
(ii) In the event of the samples conforming to the prescribed standards, the Customs
would switch to a system of checking 5% -
20% of the consignments of these food items on a random basis, for checking conformity to the
prescribed standards. The selection of food items for random checking and testing would be done by
the Customs taking into consideration factors like the nature of the food products, its source of
origin as well as track record of the importers as well as information received from FSSAI from time
to time.
(iii In case, a sample drawn from a food item in a particular consignment fails to meet the
prescribed standards, the Customs would place the import of the said consignment on alert,
discontinue random checking for import of such food items and revert to the procedure of
compulsory checking. The system of random sampling for import of such food items would be
restored only if the test results of the samples drawn from the 5 consecutive consignments
re-establish that the food items are in conformity with the prescribed standards.
8.Authorised Officers of FSSAI will ascertain that for the imported pre-packaged good items, the
language and other major requirements of the label like mention of best before date, nutrition

M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
information etc. should comply the labeling provisions under PFA Rules, failing which sample may
not be drawn from such consignment for testing.
9.It is also clarified that Risk Management System (RMS) module for import consignments of edible
/ food items, presently does not provide for random sampling as it is one of its CCR (Compulsory
Customs Requirements) targets. Accordingly, Risk Management System (RMS) shall take necessary
steps to modify the RMS module to conform to the new requirements. Till such time, this
modification is carried out, Customs shall take appropriate decision to waive the CCR requirements
in respect of food items not covered under Para 7 (a) and 7 (b) above and to the extent mentioned
under Para 7 (c) above. In terms of Circular No.43/2005-Cus dated 24th November, 2005 such a
course of action shall, however, be taken only with the prior approval of the jurisdictional
Commissioner of Customs or an officer authorized by him for this purpose, who shall not be below
the rank of Addl./Joint Commissioner of Customs, and after recording the reasons for the same. A
brief remark on the reasons and the particulars of Commissioner/ADC/JC authorization should be
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 made by the officer examining the goods in
the departmental comments in the EDI system.
10.Further, as per Para 13 of Chapter I A (General Notes Regarding Import Policy) of the ITC (HS)
Classification of Export and Import items, import of all such edible/ food products, domestic sale
and manufacture which are governed by PFA Act, 1954 shall also be subject to the condition that at
the time of importation, the products are having a valid shelf life of not less than 60% of the original
shelf life. Shelf life of the product is to be calculated based on the declaration given on the label of
the product, regarding its date of manufacture and the due date for expiry. Therefore, Customs shall
ensure that this condition is complied with before allowing clearance of such consignments.
11. It is clarified that at certain ports / airports / ICDs / CFSs where Port Health Officers (PHO)
under PFA, 1954 or Authorised officers under FSS Act, 2006 are not available, the samples will be
drawn by Customs and the same may be got tested from the nearest Central Food Laboratory or a
laboratory authorized for such testing by DGHS or FSSAI.
12. RMD shall develop an application software that incorporates the stipulation of testing of
imported foodstuff and alerts the Customs officer to the effect the number of past shipments already
tested and found fit warrants future shipments need not ordinarily be tested. This should apply
regardless of port of import so long as the importer, supplier and item of import do not change. In
other words, if such a shipment is imported say, at Mumbai and the previous 5 shipments imported
at, say, Delhi have passed the test, then the next shipment at Mumbai need not be tested. A suitable
data base would also be prepared at each Custom House to indicate the compliance history of
importers.
13. The Board Circular 58/2001-Cus dated 25.10.2001 stands modified to above extent.
14. These instructions may be brought to the notice of all concerned by way of issuance of suitable
Public Notice / Standing Order.

30. The Government of India, Ministry of Finance has issued Circular No. 30 of
2017-cus dated 18 th July, 2017 which provides for a detail guidelines for re- testing
of the samples, the same is produced hereunder:
"Circular No.fe /2017-Cus F.No. 450/15/2017-Cus IV Government of India Ministry
of Finance Department of Revenue (Central Board of Excise & Custom) **********
New Delhi, dated the/18th July, 2017 To, All Principal Chief Commissioners/Chief
Commissioners of Customs / Customs(Preventive), All Principal Chief
Commissioners/Chief Commissioners of Customs and Central Excise, All Directors
General, All Principal Commissioners/Commissioners of Customs / Customs
(Preventive), All Principal Commissioners/ Commissioners of Customs and Central
Excise.
Sir/Madam, Sub: Detailed guidelines for re-testing of samples- reg.
World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiated Trade Facilitation Agreement
(TFA),which aims at simplifying the trade processes and bringing down barriers to
trade has come into force w.e.f 22nd February, 2017. India is a signatory to this
agreement. Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019
2) India has placed a number of trade related measures negotiated under the TFA in
Category A. Article 5.3.1 envisages granting an opportunity for a second test in case
the first test result of a sampletaken upon arrival of goods declared for importation
shows an adverse finding. Further Article 5.3.3makes it obligatory to consider the
result of the second test, if any, for the release and clearance of goods, and, if
appropriate, may accept the results of such test. The aforementioned Articles have
been placed incategory A. In order to have uniformity in approach among the field
formations with regard to re-testing of samples, the following procedure is
prescribed:
a. Customs officers may draw the samples from import consignments for testing in
case of consignments wherever needed. The results of all test reports, adverse or
otherwise, shall be communicated to the importer or his authorized representative/
Customs Broker immediately on its receipt. b. In case the importer or his agent
intends to request the Additional/ Joint Commissioner of Customs for a re-rest, then
the same shall be made in writing to the said officer within a period of ten days from
the receipt of the communication of the test results of the first test. Customs officers
may take a reasoned view in case the importer or his authorized representative
Customs Broker is unable to do so for reasons beyond his control.
c. Where the Additional/Joint Commissioner of Customs grants an opportunity for a
second test, he must clearly indicate in writing the name and address of the
laboratory/institution where the second test can be carried out. Such referral for
re-testing may be made only after being reasonably sure that the desired re- testing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 14
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
facilities exist at the laboratory/ institution.
d. Re-test should be made only on the remnants of the samples originally tested or on
duplicate representative sealed samples in the custody of the Customs. Further, to
avoid delays, samples for second tests shall be marked as "immediate" before sending
to the laboratory. In a case it may so happen that fresh samples have to be drawn,
then such sampling should be done in the presence of the importer or his
representative/customs broker. e. The requests for re-test of samples on the ground
that the original sample was not representative should be entertained only if the
consignment is still in Customs control. At the time of drawing the samples, the
importer or his representative shall be present and certify that the samples drawn are
representative. f. The competent authority shall consider the results of the re-test
without prejudice to the results of the first test. In case there is a variation in the
results of the first test and the re-test,the competent authority shall take the decision
relying upon either of the tests specifying the grounds in writing for the decision so
taken. In case the competent authority is unable to decide whether to rely upon the
first or the re-test results, then it may order a second re-test provided the
consignment is still within the customs control. However, this option should not be
resorted to in every case of variation between the first test and re-test results. g. The
facility of re-testing, is a trade facilitation measure, which should generally not be
denied in the ordinary course. However, there might arise circumstances where the
customs officer is constrained to deny the re-testing facility. Board expects that Patna
High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 such denial would be occasional
and on reasonable grounds to be recorded in writing.
h. Where the re-testing procedure is done at the instance of the department instead
of the importer, the above procedure shall be followed mutatis mutandis.3)
Difficulties, if any, in implementation of this circular, should be brought to the notice
of the Board.4) Hindi version of the circular will follow.

A letter from Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs regarding matter
related to import of Areca Nut / Betel Nut.

The undersigned is directed to refer to D.O. letter No. 451/24/2018 Cus.V dated
05.04.2019 [copy enclosed] received from Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes
& Customs (CBITC), Department of Revenue, M/o Finance addressed to Secretary,
DPIIT regarding matter related to import of Areca nut /Betel nut.
2. In this regard, it is stated that the matter was referred to BABL and NABL vide email dated
16.05.2019 (copy enclosed) has stated that they have contacted ARDF Mangalore and ICAR- IISR,
Calicut labs and discussed regarding NABL accreditation. NABL would follow up with them and
ensure their accreditation status at the earliest. NABL has attached a list of few NABL accredited
labs which have accreditation as on date (about 4-5 labs for testing Arecanut /Beetal nut and about
60 labs for testing black pepper). The list of NABL accredited lab for Pepper, Areca nut and Betel
nut is enclosed at Annexure-I, Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively.
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 This issues with the approval of Secretary,

The Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBITC), Department of Revenue,
Ministry of Finance, North Block, New Delhi-110 001"
32. On perusal of the aforesaid materials at first instance, it would appear that these
materials were not placed before the learned Writ Court in course of hearing of
C.W.J.C. No. 3784 of 2013 and M.J.C. No. 2185 of 2013 whereunder the learned Writ
Court took a view agreeing with the submissions of the writ petitioner and
respondents that the Betel Nuts which were being sent from one place to another was
not being offered for sale, at this stage, in which the samples could have been taken
out and subjected to analysis under the provisions of the Food and Safety and
Analysis Rules and Regulations. The learned Writ Court took a view that the Betel
Nuts are raw materials which requires sufficient processing to be done and only
thereafter, this would be packaged in terms of the provisions of the Food Safety and
Standards (Packing and lebelling) Regulations 2011 for being put up for sale. The
learned Writ Court took a view that the stage had not come into existence when the
sample was sent by custom authorities to the 'CFL', Kolkata (Extension Center,
Raxaul).
33. As is evident from the discussions made in the judgment dated 24.07.2013 passed
in M.J.C. No. 2185 of 2013, learned Writ Court hearing the modification application
was not apprised of the fact that all consignment of high risk food items are liable to
be referred to authorized representative of FSSAI or PHOs as the case may be for
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 testing and clearance for
testing and clearance can be allowed only after testing report as per the instructions
contained in the Custom Circular No. 58/2001 dated 25.10.2001 (referred the
Circular No. 3/11). The Court was also not informed that the Custom authorities were
authorized to take samples and get them tested from the nearest Central Food
Laboratory. Further it appears that the guidelines for provisional release of the seized
goods as contained in Circular No. 35 of 20017 was not placed before the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 16
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
Writ Court. The guidelines specifically provides in paragraph '2' that the request for
provisional release of the seized food shall not be allowed in the given cases, one of
the cases in which release shall not be allowed is where the goods do not fulfill the
statutory compliance requirements /obligations in terms of any Act, Rule, Regulation
or any other law for the time being enforced.
34. Further the information furnished by the Director (Imports) in the
communication dated 20 th November, 2018 with regard to merit of Betel/Areca Nut
are also important to appreciate. It clearly provides that Areca Nuts, commonly
known as Betel Nuts is capable of the formation of Fungal growth during various
stages of its production, storage or transportation, therefore, the consignment of
imported Betel /Areca Nut shall not be cleared through risk management system and
all the imported consignments shall be subjected to 100% sampling and testing. The
FSSAI's authorized officers and custom officers as authorized officers were therefore,
advised to be vigilant and strictly ensure the compliance of the FSS regulations before
clearance of consignments of imported Areca/Betel Nuts.
35. At this stage, this Court is getting a clarity as regards the stage of testing of the
Areca Nuts / Betel Nuts. In terms of the views of the Food Safety and Standards
Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 Authority of India as stated
in the information dated 20 th November, 2018, Areca Nuts / Betel Nuts is to be
tested strictly and it cannot be said that the Betel Nuts being a raw material unless
processed and packed for sale for consumption, cannot be subjected to the laboratory
test. This Court is, therefore, of the considered opinion that the plea which is being
taken by learned counsel for the petitioners citing the judgment of the learned Writ
Court in C.W.J.C. No. 3784 of 2013 and M.J.C. No. 2185 of 2013 cannot be accepted.
It is well settled law that a judgment of the Court is always rendered in the facts
placed before the Court and the submissions made in the matter. Since this Court has
found that the aforesaid materials were not brought before the learned Writ Court in
the case of Salsar Transport Company (supra), the said decision cannot be applied on
the face of the materials which have been placed before this Court in the present case.
Nothing has been brought to show that the very sampling and testing of the Areca
Nut was not in accordance with law.
36. The another submission of learned counsel for the petitioners that there cannot
be a refusal to provisionally release the goods on the grounds stated in Annexure '4'
to the writ application is also not acceptable to this Court. The Court has taken note
of the detail guidelines issued by the Department of Customs to streamline the
divergent procedures being followed for grant of provisional release of the goods
which are seized under Section 110 of the Customs Act, 1962. The provisional release
of the seized goods is to be refused when the goods do not fulfill the statutory
compliance requirements of any Act, Rule, Regulation or any other law for the time
being enforced.

M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
37. In the present case, since the Food Laboratory Report has found that the Betel
Nut are not fit for human Patna High Court CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019
consumption, in the opinion of this Court, no fault may be found with the rejection of
the request of the petitioners for grant of release.
38. Now coming to the another question with regard to the sustainability of the
seizure. This Court had earlier occasion to deal one mater being C.W.J.C. No. 7589 of
2018 (M/s Ayesha Exports vs. The Union of India and Ors.). In the said case the
solitary question which was considered by this Court was as to whether the seizure
report may be allowed to sustain when it is an admitted position that M/s Areca Nut
Research and Development Foundation, Manglore is not accredited laboratory and
it's report has been held to be of no legal sanctity by the learned Writ Court in Salsar
Transport Company (supra). In the same case the seizure of Betel Nuts was sought to
be done on the sole consideration that the report of ADRF, Manglore declared that
the Betel Nuts seemed to be of Indonesian Origin. This Court held that because in the
case of Salsar Transport Company and Anr. (supra) the report was not having any
legal sanctity and there was not material to show that the said laboratory is an
accredited laboratory by the competent authority, it's report cannot have a
consequence of fastening of any legal liability. In the said case, the information
received under the Right to Information Act by the petitioner were placed before this
Court wherein the Directorate of Areca Nuts and Spics Development, Government of
India in response to query as to whether a Betel Nut is indigenous grown or of foreign
origin can be determined by means of any laboratory test, the information supplied
by the Government: "No laboratory test has been standardized for tracing the country
of origin".
39. It appears that after the aforesaid judgment passed by this Court on 24.01.2019, the respondents
came in action and the matter was taken up at the level of the Ministry Patna High Court CWJC
No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 of Commerce and Industry, Department for Promotion of Industry
and Internal Trade. This Court has taken note of the office Memorandum dated 4th June, 2019
hereinabove which shows that about 4-5 labs have already been accredited for testing Areca Nuts /
Betel Nuts and steps towards accreditation of ARDF and ICAR-IISR, Calicut Labs were under
discussion and it was to be done at the earliest.
40. Learned counsel for the Union of India, Department of Customs has submitted that the
developments so far may persuade this Court not to interfere with the seizure at this stage when the
matter is still under investigation and a complete view may be taken as regards the foreign origin
after obtaining a report from the accredited lab.
41. This Court is of the considered opinion that in the given facts and circumstances of the case,
where the matter is still under investigation and even some accredited labs have come into
existence, this Court need not interfere with the seizure of the Betel Nuts at this stage and this issue
be kept open for consideration at appropriate stage after the investigation is over and the
respondents receive a report as regards the country of origin from an accredited lab within a period
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185025703/ 18
M/S Ramesh Kumar Baid And Sons (Huf) vs Union Of India Through The Commissioner ... on 4 September, 2019
of three months by following the established procedures.
42. In result, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the impugned orders. The writ application
has no merit. It is dismissed accordingly."
13. The ratio of the above-quoted judgment would fully apply in the facts and circumstances of this
case. This Court has taken note of the reports and other circumstances as stated in Patna High Court
CWJC No.6563 of 2019 dt.05-09-2019 paragraph '7' to '11' of the counter affidavit of the
respondents.
The samples of Betel Nuts are in damaged condition with presence of insects. These are thus, unsafe
for human consumption. Other unifications are still going on. The petitioner no. 1 is, thus, unable to
make out a case for direction to release the Betel Nuts. For the reasons stated in paragraph '41' of the
judgment in C.W.J.C. No. 10109 of 2019, this Court would not interfere with the seizure at this
stage.
14. As regards the release of vehicle in question, it will be open for petitioner no. 2 to make an
appropriate application before the competent authority who will consider the same and pass an
appropriate order thereon within a period of 30 days from the date of filing of the application.
