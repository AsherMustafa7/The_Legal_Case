vide order dated 1.11.2023 annexed as annexure-3 to the bail application.

5. Learned A.G.A. appearing on behalf of the State opposed the prayer for bail but admits that except
for the aforesaid cases, applicant's involvement in any other case is not present.
6. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Sanjay Chandra v. Central Bureau of Investigation, reported in
(2012) 1 SCC 40 has specifically held that bail is to be a norm and an under-trial is not required to be
in jail for ever pending trial. Relevant paragraphs of the judgment are as under :-
"21. In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the earliest times that
the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the accused person at his trial by
reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor preventative.
Deprivation of liberty must be considered a punishment, unless it is required to
ensure that an accused person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe
more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction,
and that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty."
"27. This Court, time and again, has stated that bail is the rule and committal to jail
an exception. It has also observed that refusal of bail is a restriction on the personal
liberty of the individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution."
7. Upon consideration of submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties and perusal of
material on record, prima facie, and subject to further evidence being led in trial, it appears that
applicant has already been enlarged on bail in all the cases filed against him as averred in the
affidavit filed in support of the application and therefore conditions indicated in Section 19(4) U.P.
Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 stand complied with at this stage,
therefore the applicant is entitled to be released on bail in this case.
8. Accordingly bail application is allowed.
