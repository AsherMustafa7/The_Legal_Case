Vishal Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
Date: 15-10-2025
Heard the parties.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025
2/11
2. The appellant in the L.P.A. has prayed for following
relief:
"(i) For directing the respondents, particularly
the bank to pay interest on the principal
amount of (cid:128)1,87,75,000/- (Rupees One Crore
Eighty-Seven Lakhs Seventy-Five Thousand
only) deposited by the appellant till the date of
handing over the possession i.e., 19.06.2024 to
11.02.2025
."
3. The brief facts leading to the filing of the present Letters Patent Appeal are that the appellant
herein, who was the writ petitioner before the Learned Single Judge, had participated in an
e-auction conducted by the respondent Bank for sale of a mortgaged property. The appellant
emerged as the highest bidder and accordingly deposited the entire sale consideration amounting to
(cid:128)1,87,75,000/- (Rupees One Crore Eighty-Seven Lakhs Seventy-Five Thousand only) on 19.06.2024
in favour of the respondent Bank. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that despite
payment of the entire sale consideration, the respondent Bank failed to hand over the physical
possession of the property or execute the sale deed in favour of the appellant within a reasonable
period of time, thereby depriving him of both possession and ownership rights for several months.
4. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that only pursuant to the interim order
dated 05.02.2025 Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 passed by this Hon'ble
Court in CWJC No. 16777 of 2024, the Bank ultimately handed over the physical possession of the
flat in question to the appellant on 11.02.2025. Thus, from 19.06.2024 till 11.02.2025, for a period of
nearly eight months, the appellant was deprived of possession of the property despite having paid
the entire sale amount. It is further contended that during this entire period, the respondent Bank
continued to hold and utilize the substantial sum of (cid:128)1,87,75,000/- belonging to the appellant,
without paying any interest thereon, which is wholly unjustified and arbitrary.
5. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Hon'ble Single Judge, while disposing of
the writ petition, was pleased to direct the respondent Bank to execute the sale deed in favour of the
appellant, which direction has since been complied with. However, the Learned Single Judge erred
in rejecting the appellant's legitimate claim for interest on the amount deposited, which had
remained with the Bank for an unduly long period. The appellant's grievance is confined solely to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26641550/ 2
Vishal Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
this part of the impugned order dated 29.04.2025 passed in CWJC No. 16777 of 2024.
6. It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Hon'ble Single Judge failed to
properly Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 appreciate that the Bank, after
receiving the full bid amount, was under a legal and equitable obligation to hand over the possession
and execute the sale deed without unnecessary delay. The failure to do so amounts to arbitrary and
unreasonable conduct, causing financial loss and mental distress to the appellant. The counsel
further submits that the appellant, having acted in good faith and deposited the full consideration
under the bona fide belief that he would be handed over peaceful possession along with title
transfer, has been wrongfully deprived of the use and enjoyment of both the property and his own
funds for a considerable time.
7. It is further urged that the rejection of the claim for interest on the ground that the appellant had
participated in the auction process is misconceived and contrary to settled principles of equity and
justice. The learned counsel emphasizes that the Bank had enjoyed the benefit of the appellant's
funds for several months without any corresponding benefit being extended to the appellant, and
therefore, it is incumbent upon the Bank to pay reasonable interest for the said period.
8. The learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, prays that the impugned order dated 29.04.2025
passed by the Learned Single Judge be set aside to the extent it rejects the claim of interest, and this
Hon'ble Court be pleased to hold that the Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025
appellant is legally entitled to interest on the deposited amount of (cid:128)1,87,75,000/- from 19.06.2024
till 11.02.2025, when the possession was finally delivered.
9. In response to the present Letters Patent Appeal, the learned counsel for the respondents no. 3 to
6 respectfully submits that the appeal filed by the appellant is wholly misconceived, devoid of merit,
and amounts to a clear abuse of the process of law. It is urged that the part of the impugned order
dated 29.04.2025 passed by the Learned Single Judge in CWJC No. 16777 of 2024, whereby the
claim for payment of interest was rejected, is well-reasoned, legally justified, and based on sound
appreciation of facts and law.
10. It is submitted that the appellant's participation in the e-auction held on 06.06.2024 was with
full and conscious knowledge that the confirmation of sale was expressly made subject to further
orders of the Hon'ble Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Patna, in S.A. No. 66 of 2024 filed by the
original borrower. The appellant was subsequently impleaded as a party to the said proceeding. The
learned counsel for the respondents submits that having knowingly participated in a conditional
auction and having accepted the risk of delay contingent upon the outcome of the DRT proceedings,
the appellant is estopped, both Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 in law and in
equity, from now turning around and seeking interest or compensation on account of that very
delay. The appellant voluntarily entered into the transaction despite being aware of the litigation.
11. The learned counsel further submits that the allegations of arbitrariness or inaction on the part
of the Bank are baseless and contrary to the record. The delay in handing over possession was
neither deliberate nor unjustified. It was directly attributable to two uncontrollable factors: first, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26641550/ 3
Vishal Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
pendency of S.A. No. 66 of 2024 before the DRT, which rendered the sale conditional; and second,
the original borrower's continued illegal occupation and refusal to vacate or remove their household
articles from the secured asset. The Bank could not have lawfully delivered vacant possession until
these impediments were cleared. The respondents' actions were entirely in conformity with law, and
any delay was an inevitable consequence of the pending litigation and physical encumbrance of the
property.
12. It is further urged by the learned counsel for the respondents that the appellant's assertion that
the Bank had "enjoyed" the auction money for several months is a gross mischaracterization of the
legal and factual position. The learned counsel clarifies that the auction proceeds deposited by the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 appellant were not placed in any
profit-bearing account for the Bank's benefit but were adjusted against the outstanding dues of a
non-performing asset (NPA). The primary objective of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 is recovery of public
money and reduction of NPAs, not profit-making by banks. The funds were applied towards the
recovery of defaulted loan amounts, and hence, the allegation of unjust enrichment is wholly
unfounded.
13. The learned counsel for the respondents further submits that the SARFAESI auction is a
statutory process governed by the principles of caveat emptor--"let the buyer beware"--and is
conducted on "As is where is", "As is what is", and "Whatever there is" basis. The appellant, being a
participant in such a sale, had a corresponding obligation to undertake due diligence regarding the
property's status, title, and possession. The Bank, as a secured creditor, is not a real estate vendor
guaranteeing a clear title or immediate possession; its role is confined to enforcing the security
interest to recover its dues. Therefore, the appellant cannot claim to have been misled or to have
suffered any legally compensable injury due to delay arising from circumstances explicitly
mentioned in the auction terms and public notice.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025
14. The learned counsel for the respondents therefore submits that the appeal is devoid of any
substance and is liable to be dismissed in limine. The appellant, having consciously participated in a
conditional auction, cannot seek to rewrite the terms of sale or demand compensation for a
foreseeable delay arising out of judicial proceedings. The impugned order dated 29.04.2025 does
not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference. Accordingly, it is humbly prayed that this
Hon'ble Court may be pleased to dismiss the present Letters Patent Appeal, upholding the reasoned
findings of the Learned Single Judge and affirming the rejection of the appellant's claim for payment
of interest.
15. Upon perusal of the pleadings, documents, and submissions advanced on behalf of the parties,
the principal issue that arises for consideration before this Hon'ble Court is whether, in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, the appellant, having deposited the entire sale consideration of
(cid:128)1,87,75,000/- pursuant to the e-auction conducted under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act,
2002, and having been subsequently delivered possession of the property after certain delay
occasioned by pending litigation and judicial orders, is entitled in law or in equity Patna High Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/26641550/ 4
Vishal Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 to claim any interest on the said deposited amount for the
intervening period during which possession remained undelivered.
16. It is not in dispute that the appellant had deposited the entire sale consideration on 19.06.2024
and that the physical possession of the property was handed over to him only on 11.02.2025,
pursuant to the interim order of the Learned Single Judge dated 05.02.2025. Thus, for a period of
nearly eight months, the appellant's substantial amount remained with the respondent Bank
without the corresponding benefit of possession or enjoyment of the property. The record reveals
that the delay in handing over possession was not attributable to any default or omission on the part
of the appellant, who had duly complied with all the obligations stipulated in the auction notice and
terms of sale.
17. This Court finds merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Bank,
having accepted the entire consideration amount, was under an obligation--both legal and
equitable--to deliver possession within a reasonable time. The plea of the Bank that the delay was
due to pendency of litigation or the conduct of the borrower cannot absolve it of the responsibility to
safeguard the interests of the bona fide auction purchaser. Once the sale was confirmed and the
amount was Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 accepted, the Bank became a
trustee of the deposited funds to the extent that it could not unjustly retain or utilize the same
without extending possession to the purchaser. The conduct of the Bank in withholding possession
for nearly eight months, despite receiving full payment, has caused demonstrable financial prejudice
to the appellant, who was deprived of the use of both his funds and the property.
18. The Learned Single Judge, while passing the impugned order dated 29.04.2025, failed to
appreciate that the appellant's claim for interest was not based on any commercial bargain but on
principles of equity, fairness, and accountability. Even if the SARFAESI Act, 2002 or the Security
Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002 do not expressly provide for payment of interest in such
circumstances, this Court is of the view that the inherent jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226
of the Constitution of India permits grant of just and equitable relief to ensure that a party is not
made to suffer for reasons not attributable to them.
19. Accordingly, this Court holds that the appellant is legally entitled to interest on the amount of
(cid:128)1,87,75,000/-, as the retention of such a substantial sum by the Bank without corresponding
delivery of possession was wholly unjustified.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.615 of 2025 dt.15-10-2025 Appellant however cannot be granted interest
from 19.06.2024 to 18.09.2024 as handling process time for the Bank would be around ninety days
from the date of deposit, which has to be taken into account. The rejection of this claim by the
Learned Single Judge in the impugned order dated 29.04.2025, therefore, cannot be sustained in
the eyes of law and stands set aside to that extent.
20. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The respondents are directed to pay to the appellant simple
interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the amount of (cid:128)1,87,75,000/- for the aforesaid period i.e,
from 19.09.2024 (the date of deposit) till 11.02.2025 (the date of delivery of possession), within a

period of four months from the date of receipt of this judgment. All pending interlocutory
applications, if any, stand disposed of.
