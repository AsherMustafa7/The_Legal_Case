Counsel for Petitioner :- Sanjay Misra,Neeranjan,Pratyush Mishra
Counsel for Respondent :- C.S.C.
Hon'ble Alok Mathur,J.
1. Heard Sri Sanjay Mishra, learned counsel for petitioner as well as learned Standing Counsel for
the State and perused the material available on record.
2. It has been submitted by learned counsel for petitioner that father of the petitioner, Late Amar
Nath Mishra was appointed on the post of Collection Amin on 19.02.1997.
3. The husband of the petitioner contentiously worked on the said post for 23 long years and died on
25.01.2022 while being in service. It has been submitted that during his service period of 23 years

disciplinary proceedings were ever initiated against him. The father of the petitioner left behind his
widow, two sons i.e., one son of 21 years and one second son of 9 years.
4. It is on the death of the husband of the petitioner that the petitioner has moved an application
under the U.P. Recruitment of Dependant of Government Servant Dying in Harness Rules, 1974
seeking compassionate appointment considering the fact that the sole bread earner had died leaving
the family in financial destitution.
5. It is when the application of the petitioner was not considered for appointment the petitioner was
constraint to file a writ petition before this Court being Writ A No. 3487 of 2022, which was
disposed of by this Court by order dated 31.05.2022 directing the respondent No. 2 to decide the
representation expeditiously in two weeks. The Chief Information Commissioner i.e. respondent No.
2 has passed the impugned order dated 26.06.2022 rejecting the representation of the petitioner.
6. The only ground considered for rejection was that the father of the petitioner was appointed on
the post of Collection Amin on 19.02.1997 without following any rules. It was further noticed that
his services were purely temporary and could have been terminated by giving a notice as per the
provision of Uttar Pradesh Temporary Government Servant (Termination of Service) Rules 1975.
7. It was stated that no procedure was followed while appointing him and accordingly for the same
very reason, the petitioner cannot be granted benefit of the U.P. Recruitment of Dependant of
Government Servant Dying in Harness Rules, 1974 and accordingly his representation was rejected.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner on the other hand has submitted that the very fact that
husband of the petitioner had worked contentiously for a period of 23 years which indicates that
there were a permanent vacancy against which he was working and it is the negligence and
callousness of the respondents who did not regularize his service even after continuously working
for 23 years.
9. It is stated that the respondents cannot take any advantage of their own fault in light of the fact
that relevant regularization rules were in place and the case of the petitioner could have been duly
considered for regularization prior to his death but the respondents only exploiting the situation of
poor employees continued to permit him to work on temporary basis for 23 years and it is for this
reasons after his death they have denied the benefit of compassionate appointment to the petitioner.
10. He further submits that State being a model employer cannot exploit the situation of poor
persons. He further submits that this aspect of the matter was duly considered by Hon'ble the
Supreme Court in the case of Jaggo Vs. Union of India and Others, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3826
where the supreme Court had held that if a person works uninterruptedly for more that period of 10
years even though his initial appoint was de hors the rules even then essence of their employment
must be considered in the light of their sustained contribution, the integral nature of their work, and
the fact that no evidence suggests their entry was through any illegal or surreptitious route. Relevant
paragraphs of the said judgment are quoted as under:-

"10. Having given careful consideration to the submissions advanced and the
material on record, we find that the appellants' long and uninterrupted service, for
periods extending well beyond ten years, cannot be brushed aside merely by labelling
their initial appointments as part-time or contractual. The essence of their
employment must be considered in the light of their sustained contribution, the
integral nature of their work, and the fact that no evidence suggests their entry was
through any illegal or surreptitious route.
13. The claim by the respondents that these were not regular posts lacks merit, as the
nature of the work performed by the appellants was perennial and fundamental to
the functioning of the offices. The recurring nature of these duties necessitates their
classification as regular posts, irrespective of how their initial engagements were
labelled. It is also noteworthy that subsequent outsourcing of these same tasks to
private agencies after the appellants' termination demonstrates the inherent need for
these services. This act of outsourcing, which effectively replaced one set of workers
with another, further underscores that the work in question was neither temporary
nor occasional.
19. It is evident from the foregoing that the appellants' roles were not only essential
but also indistinguishable from those of regular employees. Their sustained
contributions over extended periods, coupled with absence of any adverse record,
warrant equitable treatment and regularization of their services. Denial of this
benefit, followed by their arbitrary termination, amounts to manifest injustice and
must be rectified.
20. It is well established that the decision in Uma Devi (supra) does not intend to
penalize employees who have rendered long years of service fulfilling ongoing and
necessary functions of the State or its instrumentalities. The said judgment sought to
prevent backdoor entries and illegal appointments that circumvent constitutional
requirements.
However, where appointments were not illegal but possibly "irregular," and where
employees had served continuously against the backdrop of sanctioned functions for
a considerable period, the need for a fair and humane resolution becomes
paramount. Prolonged, continuous, and unblemished service performing tasks
inherently required on a regular basis can, over the time, transform what was initially
ad-hoc or temporary into a scenario demanding fair regularization.
In a recent judgement of this Court in Vinod Kumar and Ors. Etc. Vs. Union of India
& Ors.5, it was held that held that procedural formalities cannot be used to deny
regularization of service to an employee whose appointment was termed "temporary"
but has performed the same duties as performed by the regular employee over a
considerable period in the capacity of the regular employee. The relevant paras of this
judgement have been reproduced below:

Abhishek Mishra vs State Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief Secy. ... on 3 March, 2025
"6. The application of the judgment in Uma Devi (supra) by the High Court does not
fit squarely with the facts at hand, given the specific circumstances under which the
appellants were employed and have continued their service. The reliance on
procedural formalities at the outset cannot be used to perpetually deny substantive
rights that have accrued over a considerable period through continuous service. Their
promotion was based on a specific notification for vacancies and a subsequent
circular, followed by a selection process involving written tests and interviews, which
distinguishes their case from the appointments through back door entry as discussed
in the case of Uma Devi (supra).
7. The judgement in the case Uma Devi (supra) also distinguished between
"irregular" and "illegal" appointments underscoring the importance of considering
certain appointments even if were not made strictly in accordance with the
prescribed Rules and Procedure, cannot be said to have been made illegally if they
had followed the procedures of regular appointments such as conduct of written
examinations or interviews as in the present case."
27. In light of these considerations, in our opinion, it is imperative for government departments to
lead by example in providing fair and stable employment. Engaging workers on a temporary basis
for extended periods, especially when their roles are integral to the organization's functioning, not
only contravenes international labour standards but also exposes the organization to legal
challenges and undermines employee morale. By ensuring fair employment practices, government
institutions can reduce the burden of unnecessary litigation, promote job security, and uphold the
principles of justice and fairness that they are meant to embody. This approach aligns with
international standards and sets a positive precedent for the private sector to follow, thereby
contributing to the overall betterment of labour practices in the country."
11. Further reliance was placed in the case of Shripal and another Vs. Nagar Nigam, Ghaziabad,
2025 SCC OnLIne SC 221, where the Hon'ble the Supreme court has relied with approval with the
case of Jaggo (Supra) and observed as under:-
"15. It is manifest that the Appellant Workmen continuously rendered their services
over several years, sometimes spanning more than a decade. Even if certain muster
rolls were not produced in full, the Employer's failure to furnish such records?despite
directions to do so?allows an adverse inference under well-established labour
jurisprudence. Indian labour law strongly disfavors perpetual daily-wage or
contractual engagements in circumstances where the work is permanent in nature.
Morally and legally, workers who fulfil ongoing municipal requirements year after
year cannot be dismissed summarily as dispensable, particularly in the absence of a
genuine contractor agreement. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to recall the
broader critique of indefinite "temporary" employment practices as done by a recent
judgement of this court in Jaggo v. Union of India in the following paragraphs:

"22. The pervasive misuse of temporary employment contracts, as exemplified in this
case, reflects a broader systemic issue that adversely affects workers' rights and job
security. In the private sector, the rise of the gig economy has led to an increase in
precarious employment arrangements, often characterized by lack of benefits, job
security, and fair treatment. Such practices have been criticized for exploiting
workers and undermining labour standards. Government institutions, entrusted with
upholding the principles of fairness and justice, bear an even greater responsibility to
avoid such exploitative employment practices. When public sector entities engage in
misuse of temporary contracts, it not only mirrors the detrimental trends observed in
the gig economy but also sets a concerning precedent that can erode public trust in
governmental operations.
...
25. It is a disconcerting reality that temporary employees, particularly in government
institutions, often face multifaceted forms of exploitation. While the foundational
purpose of temporary contracts may have been to address short-term or seasonal
needs, they have increasingly become a mechanism to 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3826
evade long-term obligations owed to employees. These practices manifest in several
ways:
. Misuse of "Temporary" Labels: Employees engaged for work that is essential,
recurring, and integral to the functioning of an institution are often labelled as
"temporary" or "contractual," even when their roles mirror those of regular
employees. Such misclassification deprives workers of the dignity, security, and
benefits that regular employees are entitled to, despite performing identical tasks.
. Arbitrary Termination: Temporary employees are frequently dismissed without
cause or notice, as seen in the present case. This practice undermines the principles
of natural justice and subjects workers to a state of constant insecurity, regardless of
the quality or duration of their service. ? Lack of Career Progression: Temporary
employees often find themselves excluded from opportunities for skill development,
promotions, or incremental pay raises. They remain stagnant in their roles, creating a
systemic disparity between them and their regular counterparts, despite their
contributions being equally significant.
. Using Outsourcing as a Shield: Institutions increasingly resort to outsourcing roles
performed by temporary employees, effectively replacing one set of exploited workers
with another. This practice not only perpetuates exploitation but also demonstrates a
deliberate effort to bypass the obligation to offer regular employment.
. Denial of Basic Rights and Benefits: Temporary employees are often denied
fundamental benefits such as pension, provident fund, health insurance, and paid
leave, even when their tenure spans decades. This lack of social security subjects

them and their families to undue hardship, especially in cases of illness, retirement,
or unforeseen circumstances."
12. A perusal of the aforesaid observations of the Supreme Court leads to the irrefutable conclusion
that rendering services for more than 10 years and beyond and in the present case is 23 years has
rendered the petitioner liable, the services of husband of the petitioner liable to be regularised and
in any case he does not lie to the respondents to say that merely because the initial appointment was
irregular, they would deny the benefit of compassionate appointment to the petitioner.
13. In the impugned order, this Court finds that there has been a reiteration of the fact that the
services of the petitioner were temporary and could have been dismissed by one month's notice.
Even though such a provision does exist and it was open for the respondents to have invoked the
said provision, had any occasion arisen in this regard but it seems that the husband of the petitioner
worked sincerely and with due diligence due to which despite the fact that he was a temporary
government servant, the respondents never invoked provisions of terminating his services by giving
him one month's notice.
14. According this Court finds that after rendering 23 years of service, the husband of the petitioner
was liable to be considered as a regular employee and all the benefits accrue to him should be
granted on his death to the members of his family.
15. Accordingly, for the reasons aforesaid, the impugned order dated 26.06.2022 is set aside. The
respondents are directed to consider the case of the petitioner for appointment treating the services
of the father of the petitioner was in a regular employment of the Revenue Department.
16. Let the necessary orders in this regard be passed expeditiously, say, within a period of six week
from the date a certified copy of this order is produced before him.
17. In view of the aforesaid observations / directions, the writ petition stands allowed.
