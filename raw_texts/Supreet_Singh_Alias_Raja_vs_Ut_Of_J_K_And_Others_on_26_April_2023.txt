JUDGMENT
1. The petitioner, who has been detained by virtue of an order bearing No. 18 of 2022 dated
22.11.2022 issued by respondent No. 2 under Section 8(1) (a) of the Jammu and Kashmir Public
Safety Act, 1978, has impugned the said detention order through the medium of the present writ
petition.
2. In the petition filed through his father, the petitioner has mentioned details of the documents
furnished to him i.e. the order of detention dated 22.11.2022, the communication dated 22.11.2022
issued by the respondent No. 2 to the respondent No.1, the communication dated 22.11.2022 issued
by the respondent No. 2 to the petitioner and the Dossier dated 07.11.2022. It is stated that the
detaining authority has failed to take into consideration the fact that in all the FIRs registered
against the petitioner, he has been enlarged on bail and all the FIRs except one are stale in nature. It
is further stated that the order of detention was not read over and explained to the petitioner in the
language that petitioner understands. It is also stated that the order impugned suffers from
non-application of mind as no awareness has been shown by the detaining authority to the bail
granted to the petitioner and also that the facts narrated, did not make any case for acting in any
manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. The petitioner has also placed on record the
copy of the judgment dated 31.03.2022 passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court, wherein the
order of detention bearing No. 6 of 2021 dated 05.05.2021 passed by the District Magistrate,
Jammu against the petitioner was quashed.

3. The counter affidavit stands filed, wherein it has been stated that the petitioner has been detained
by virtue of order impugned, after the respondent No. 3 submitted the dossier dated 07.11.2022, in
order to prevent the petitioner from indulging in the criminal activities prejudicial to the
maintenance of the Public Order. The detention order along with grounds of detention and other
material relied upon by the detaining authority was provided to the petitioner. The order of
detention was executed on 23.11.2022 and the documents were read over and explained to the
detenue in a language Dogri/Hindi, which is fully understood by the detenue. The details of eight
FIRs have been mentioned in the counter-affidavit and taking into consideration the alleged illegal
activities of the petitioner, he was ordered to be detained.
4. Mr. K. S. Johal, learned senior counsel for the petitioner argued that the order of detention has
been issued in a mechanical manner and the detaining authority has not shown its awareness about
the issuance of earlier detention order that was quashed by this Court vide its judgment dated
31.03.2022. Mr. Johal further argued that earlier detention order issued on the basis of seven FIRs
registered against the petitioner was quashed by the court and the order impugned could not have
been issued by the detaining authority on the basis of FIR No. 349/2022, as allegations levelled in
the said FIR do not fall within the realm of "activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public
order", as defined by Section 8(3) (b) of the Act.
5. Mr. Pawan Dev Singh, learned Dy. AG vehemently argued that the petitioner is a habitual
offender and despite his release on bail in all the cases and also after quashing of earlier detention
order, the petitioner has not mended his behaviour and continued to indulge in illegal activities,
which necessitated the detaining authority to issue the order of detention against the petitioner.
6. Heard and perused the record.
7. A perusal of the record reveals that the following FIRs have been registered against the
petitioner:-
(a) FIR No. 64/2014 u/s 307/323/34 RPC, Police Station, Peer Mitha, Jammu.
(b) FIR No. 210/2015 u/s 307/341/34 RPC, Police Station, Gandhi Nagar, Jammu.
(c) FIR No. 04/2017 u/s 452/367/511/147/148 RPC, 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station,
Bahu Fort, Jammu.
(d) FIR No. 30/2017 u/s 307/323/341/34 RPC, 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station, Pacca
Danga, Jammu.
(e) FIR No. 31/2018 u/s 307 RPC, 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station, Gandhi Nagar,
Jammu.
(f) FIR No. 208/2018 u/s 382/401/120-B RPC, 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station, Bahu
Fort, Jammu.

(h) FIR No. 349/2022 u/s 452/427/147 IPC, 3/25 Arms Act, Police Station, Domana,
Jammu.
8. The respondents have not disputed the issuance of earlier detention order No. 6 of 2021 dated
05.05.2021 and its subsequent quashing by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court vide judgment
dated 31.03.2022. A perusal of the record further reveals that the petitioner was handed over the
detention order, notice of detention, grounds of detention, dossier of detention, copies of FIR and
other documents relied upon by the detaining authority. At the time of execution of the detention
order by Inspector, namely, Tilak Raj on 23.11.2022, the petitioner has signed the receipt of grounds
of detention and other relevant record. The petitioner has also signed the execution report, as such,
the petitioner was handed over all the documents and further the documents were read over to the
petitioner by Inspector-Tilak Raj in Dogri/Hindi language. Therefore, there is no force in the
contention of the petitioner that the documents relied upon the detaining authority while issuing the
order of detention were not explained and read over to the petitioner in a language, which he
understands.
9. Further from the perusal of the dossier and the grounds of detention it is revealed that there is no
whisper in both the dossier as well as grounds of detention, that earlier also the petitioner was
detained under the Act and the said order of detention was quashed by the Co- ordinate Bench of
this Court vide its judgment dated 31.03.2022. The sponsoring authority is under an obligation to
place before the detaining authority all the relevant and vital material, so as to enable the detaining
authority to record its subjective satisfaction that detention of the detenue is necessary for the
purpose of preventing the detenue from indulging in illegal activities. The same has not been done
by the sponsoring authority and as such, this Court is of the considered view that the absence of
placing the whole of the record pertaining to the petitioner before the detaining authority i.e.
respondent No. 2, would vitiate the subjective satisfaction recorded by the detaining authority to
detain the petitioner. In "Ashadevi v. K. Shivraj, Addl. Chief Secy. to the Govt. of Gujarat, (1979) 1
SCC 222"it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that "It is well settled that the subjective
satisfaction requisite on the part of the detaining authority, the formation of which is a condition
precedent to the passing of the detention order will get vitiated if material or vital facts which would
have a bearing on the issue and would influence the mind of the detaining authority one way or the
other are ignored or not considered by the detaining authority before issuing the detention order."
10. Besides, this Court finds that the detaining authority has relied upon 8 FIRs in the grounds of
detention out of which 7 FIRs were taken note of by the detaining authority for the purpose of
issuance of the earlier order of detention dated 05.05.2021. It is further borne out from the record
that after the earlier detention order was quashed on 31.03.2022, the petitioner was found involved
in another FIR No. 349/2022 under Sections 452/427/147 IPC, 3/25 Arms Act, which was
registered with Police Station, Domana, Jammu. The petitioner could still have been detained after
the quashing of earlier order of detention provided his activities fell within the parameters of the
activities considered prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. A perusal of the said FIR reveals
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93460831/ 3
Supreet Singh Alias Raja vs Ut Of J&K And Others on 26 April, 2023
that the same was registered on the basis of DD extract No. 12 dated 07.10.2022, wherein it was
stated that on 06.10.2022, one lady, namely, Gurpreet Kour W/o Gurpreet Singh R/o Swaran
Colony Lane No. 01 Trilok Pur was alone at her house and about 12:00 PM, someone knocked the
door of her house. She woke up and saw seven persons crossing the boundary wall and entering in
her house and tried to break cameras and doors. The petitioner was having pistol but three persons
could not be identified. When she told them that she would call the Police, they fled away.
11. Now, it is to be seen as to whether on the basis of FIR mentioned above, it can be said that the
detention of the petitioner was necessary for maintenance of public order. Under section 8 (1) of the
Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, the government may detain any person if the government is
satisfied that the detention is necessary with a view to prevent such person from acting in any
manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. Section 8(3)(b) of the Act defines the
activities those are considered as prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and the same is
reproduced as under:
(3) For the purposes of sub-section (1), [(a) Omitted]
(b) "acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order" means-
(i) promoting, propagating, or attempting to create feelings of enmity or hatred or
disharmony on the ground of religion, race, caste, community, or region;
(ii) attempting to commit, or committing, or instigating, inciting, provoking or
otherwise abetting the commission of mischief within the meaning of section 425 of
the Indian Penal Code where the commission of such mischief disturbs or is likely to
disturb public order;
(iii) attempting to commit or committing or instigating, inciting, provoking or
otherwise abetting the commission of an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or imprisonment of a term extending to 7 years or more where
the commission of such offence disturbs or is likely to disturb public order;
12. The perusal of the grounds of detention reveals that in the said FIR, the allegations against the
petitioner are with regard to the commission of offences those do not fall within the realm of "public
order" as defined by section 8(3)(b) of the Act as there are no allegations against the petitioner
regarding his activities affecting public at large. The allegations may amount to law and order issue
but in no manner can be said to have disturbed the public order. In Mallada K Sri Ram v. State of
Telangana, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 424, Apex Court has considered the distinction between "law and
order" and "public order" and observed as under:
"12. The distinction between a disturbance to law and order and a disturbance to
public order has been clearly settled by a Constitution Bench in Ram Manohar Lohia
v. State of Bihar. The Court has held that every disorder does not meet the threshold
of a disturbance to public order, unless it affects the community at large. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93460831/ 4
Supreet Singh Alias Raja vs Ut Of J&K And Others on 26 April, 2023
Constitution Bench held:
"51. We have here a case of detention under Rule 30 of the Defence of India Rules
which permits apprehension and detention of a person likely to act in a manner
prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. It follows that if such a person is not
detained public disorder is the apprehended result. Disorder is no doubt prevented
by the maintenance of law and order also but disorder is a broad spectrum which
includes at one end small disturbances and at the other the most serious and
cataclysmic happenings. Does the expression "public order" take in every kind of
disorders or only some of them? The answer to this serves to distinguish "public
order" from "law and order"
because the latter undoubtedly takes in all of them. Public order if disturbed, must lead to public
disorder. Every breach of the peace does not lead to public disorder. When two drunkards quarrel
and fight there is disorder but not public disorder. They can be dealt with under the powers to
maintain law and order but cannot be detained on the ground that they were disturbing public
order. Suppose that the two fighters were of rival communities and one of them tried to raise
communal passions. The problem is still one of law and order but it raises the apprehension of
public disorder. Other examples can be imagined. The contravention of law always affects order but
before if can be said to affect public order, it must affect the community or the public at large. A
mere disturbance of law and order leading to disorder is thus not necessarily sufficient for action
under the Defence of India Act but disturbances which subvert the public order are. A District
Magistrate is entitled to take action under Rule 30(1)(b) to prevent subversion of public order but
not in aid of maintenance of law and order under ordinary circumstances.
52. It will thus appear that just as "public order" in the rulings of this Court (earlier cited) was said
to comprehend disorders of less gravity than those affecting "security of State", "law and order" also
comprehends disorders of less gravity than those affecting "public order". One has to imagine three
concentric circles. Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle
representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of State. It is then easy to see
that an act may affect law and order but not public order just as an act may affect public order but
not security of the State. By using the expression "maintenance of law and order" the District
Magistrate was widening his own field of action and was adding a clause to the Defence of India
Rules."
(emphasis supplied)
13. It is also found that the grounds of detention are the verbatim reproduction of the Dossier
submitted by the respondent No. 3 to the respondent No. 2 except with some cosmetic changes. The
detaining authority was required to apply its mind independently with regard to the material placed
before it so as to derive subjective satisfaction that it has become necessary to detain the petitioner.
The order of detention requires to be quashed on this ground as well. Reliance is placed upon the
decision of Apex Court in case titled "Jai Singh v. State of J & K, reported in (1985) 1 SCC 561" and
the relevant portion is reproduced as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/93460831/ 5
Supreet Singh Alias Raja vs Ut Of J&K And Others on 26 April, 2023
"-------First taking up the case of Jai Singh, the first of the petitioners before us, a
perusal of the grounds of detention shows that it is a verbatim reproduction of the
dossier submitted by the senior Superintendent of Police, Udhampur to the District
Magistrate requesting that a detention order may kindly be issued. At the top of the
dossier, the name is mentioned as Sardar Jai Singh, father's name is mentioned as
Sardar Ram Singh and the address is given as Village Bharakh, Tehsil Reasi.
Thereafter it is recited "The subject is an important member of...." Thereafter follow
various allegations against Jai Singh, paragraph by paragraph. In the grounds of
detention, all that the District Magistrate has done is to change the first three words
"the subject is" into "you Jai Singh, s/o Ram Singh, resident of Village Bharakh,
Tehsil Reasi". Thereafter word for word the police dossier is repeated and the word
"he" wherever it occurs referring to Jai Singh in the dossier is changed into "you" in
the grounds of detention. We are afraid it is difficult to find greater proof of
non-application of mind. The liberty of a subject is a serious matter and it is not to be
trifled with in this casual, indifferent and routine manner."
14. In view of the above, this petition is allowed and the order bearing No. 18 of 2022 dated
22.11.2022 issued by respondent No. 2 is quashed. The petitioner (detenue) be set free from the
preventive custody, provided his custody is not required in any other case.
