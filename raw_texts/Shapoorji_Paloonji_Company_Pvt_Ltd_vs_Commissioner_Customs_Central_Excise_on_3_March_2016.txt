3. Respondent No. 2, Indian Audit and Account Department, raised audit objection on 30th June,
2015 to the effect that service provider undertaking construction activity of educational institutions
are not required to pay service tax. In terms of the audit objection, the petitioner claimed that
service tax is not payable by the petitioner or by the Indian Institute of Technology, respondent
no.4, on the construction activity, undertaken by the petitioner.
4. The Government of India has issued Notification No. 25/2012, dated 20th June, 2012, exempting
the services mentioned therein from the levy of service tax in exercise of the powers conferred under
Section 93 of the Finance Act, 1994. It may also be noticed that Section 66D has been inserted by the
Finance Act, 2012 with effect from 1st July, 2012, wherein negative list of the services on which
service tax is not payable was inserted.
5. In counter affidavit, the stand of respondent No.1 is that the construction activity is taxable
service under the provision of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. It is pointed out that Notification
No.25/2012, dated 20th June, 2012, has exempted specified services from the levy of service tax
subject to fulfillment of the conditions stipulated for such exemption. Patna High Court CWJC
No.16965 of 2015 dt. 03-03-2016 The first and foremost condition needs to be satisfied is that
specified service must be provided to Government or Local Authority or Governmental Authority.
Governmental Authority has been defined by Notification No. 2/2014 dated 30th January, 2014. It
is thus asserted that the Indian Institute of Technology, Bihta, Patna, a body corporate under a
Central Statute would not be covered under the category of negative list (Section 66D) and also by
the exemption dated 20th June, 2012, as it is not a Governmental Authority within the meaning of
Notification dated 30th January, 2014. Thus the service tax is payable by the Institute. The reliance
is also placed on a circular issued on 19th September, 2013, by CBDT clarifying the ambit and scope
of levy of service tax pursuant to a representation by several educational institutions. It is clarified
that the service provided to Institute is related to construction work but is not exempt from payment
of service tax. Annexure - A appended to the reply dated 06.10.2015, addressed to respondent No.3,
makes a mention of the Notification dated 30th January, 2014, to assert that service tax is payable
by the Petitioner for the relevant period.
6. At this stage, certain statutory provisions relating to imposition of service tax under the Finance
Act, 1994 and the Notifications issued from time to time need to be extracted -
"65B. Interpretations.- In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-

Notification No. 2/2014 ST dated 30th January, 2014, partially amending the notification dated
20th June, 2012 reads as under:-
"In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 93 of the Finance
Act, 1994 (32 of 1994), the Central Government being satisfied that it is necessary in
Patna High Court CWJC No.16965 of 2015 dt. 03-03-2016 the public interest so to
do, hereby makes the following further amendments in the notification of the
Government of India in the Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue), No.
25/2012-Service Tax, dated the 20th June, 2012, published in the Gazette of India,
Extraordinary, Part II, Section 3, Sub-section (i), vide GSR 467(E), dated the 20th
June,2012, namely:-
In the said notification, in the paragraph 2, for clause(s), the following shall be
substituted, namely:-
(s) "governmental authority" means an authority or a board or any other body;
(i) set up by an Act of Parliament or a State Legislature; or
(ii) established by Government, With 90% or more participation by way of equity or
control, to carry out any function entrusted to a municipality under article 243W of
the Constitution;(cid:128)
7. Our attention has also been drawn to Notification No.6/2015 Service Tax, dated 1st March, 2015,
amending the Notification dated 20th June, 2012. By the said Notification, item nos. (a), (c) and (f)
of Entry 12 as reproduced above, stands omitted.
8. The petitioner was granted the contract for construction on 20th December, 2012. But even
before that date on 20th June, 2012, with effect from 1st July, 2012, the services provided to the
Government, local authority, or governmental authority by way of construction, erection,
commissioning, installation, completion, fitting out, repair, maintenance, renovation, or alteration
were exempted from payment of Patna High Court CWJC No.16965 of 2015 dt. 03-03-2016 service

tax. „Local authority(cid:128) has been defined under Section 65B (31) of the Finance Act, 1994, and the
„Governmental Authority(cid:128) is defined in clause 2(s) of the Notification, dated 20th June, 2012. Such
clause has been amended by Notification dated 30th January, 2014.
9. It is undisputed that the Indian Institute of Technology, Bihta, Patna, whose academic block was
to be constructed by the petitioner, was set up by an Act of Parliament, i.e., Indian Institutes of
Technology Act, 1961 (59 of 1961) as an institute of national importance under Article 248 of the
Constitution of India read with 7th Schedule List I. As per the definition of Governmental Authority
as amended on 30th January 2014, an authority or board or any other body set up by an Act of
Parliament or State Legislature is a Governmental Authority. Therefore, the Notification dated 20th
June, 2012, exempts the activity of construction undertaken by the petitioner from payment of
service tax.
10. However, the arguments of Mrs. Nivedita Nirvikar, learned counsel for respondent No.1, is that
only an authority with 90% or more participation by way of equity or control to carry out any
function entrusted to a municipality under Article 243W of the Constitution alone is the
Governmental Authority, entitled to exemption from benefit of service tax. Such provision in the
notification dated 30th January 2014 is applicable to both Patna High Court CWJC No.16965 of
2015 dt. 03-03-2016 parts of clause 2(s) and not to sub-clause (ii) of clause 2(s) alone of the said
Notification.
11. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and found the arguments raised by Mrs. Nivedita
Nirvikar are not sustainable in law. The Governmental Authority as defined in the Notification dated
30th January, 2014, means an authority or a board or any other body set up by an Act of Parliament
or State Legislature. The provisions contained in sub-clause (i) and sub- clause (ii) of Clause 2(s) are
independent dis-conjunctive provisions and the expression "90% or more participation by way of
equity or control to carry out any function entrusted to a municipality under Article 243W of the
Constitution" is related to sub-clause (ii) of Clause 2(s) alone. The clause (i) is followed by ";" and
the word "or". Therefore, each of the sub-clauses is independent provision. The condition of 90% or
more participation by way of equity or control to carry out any function entrusted to a municipality
under Article 243W of the Constitution is relatable to only sub-clause (ii) of Clause 2(s). It means
that an authority established by Government should have 90% or more participation by way of
equity or control to carry out any function entrusted to a municipality under Article 243W of the
Constitution to be eligible for exemption. The Authority set up by an Act of Parliament or State
Legislature is not and cannot be made subject to the condition of 90% or more participation Patna
High Court CWJC No.16965 of 2015 dt. 03-03-2016 by way of equity or control to carry out any
function entrusted to a municipality under Article 243W of the Constitution. Thus, the construction
activity undertaken by the petitioner in respect of the academic block of the Institute-respondent
No. 4, is exempt from payment of service tax in terms of Notification, dated 20th June, 2012 as
amended.
12. Thus, the service tax paid either by the petitioner or respondent No.4 and collected by
respondent No.1, cannot be levied or collected as it is not chargeable levy. Consequently, the
direction contained in the communication dated 05.09.2014 (Annexure 5), is quashed.

Shapoorji Paloonji & Company Pvt. Ltd vs Commissioner, Customs Central Excise ... on 3 March, 2016
13. At this stage, another argument advanced by Mrs. Nivedita Nirvikar, needs to be discussed. She
argues that the petitioner shall not be entitled to refund of the service tax as it would be a case of
undue enrichment. We do not find any merit in this argument as well. The payment of service tax
has not been made by the numerous consumers and collected by the petitioner. It is paid by the
petitioner alone. The petitioner is entitled for the reimbursement of the amount of service tax by
respondent No. 4 in terms of the letter of award of contract. Such payment of service tax by the
petitioner is not indirect collection of taxes but the direct payment by the petitioner. Therefore, it is
not a case of undue enrichment.
14. Thus, since the levy as collection of service tax Patna High Court CWJC No.16965 of 2015 dt.
03-03-2016 paid by the petitioner or respondent No.4, has not been found to be justified, therefore,
the respondent No. 1 shall refund the amount of the service tax deposited either to the petitioner or
respondent No. 4, as the case may be, expeditiously.
