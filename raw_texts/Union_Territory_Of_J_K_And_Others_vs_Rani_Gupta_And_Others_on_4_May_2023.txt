JUDGMENT
Tashi Rabstan - Judge
1. This Letters Patent Appeal is directed against the judgment dated 17.03.2021 passed by the
learned Single Judge in OWP No.975/2008, whereby the learned Single Judge while allowing the
petition, held that the writ petitioners are entitled to compensation of rupees ten lacs on account of
death of one Vijay Kumar Gupta, i.e., husband writ petitioner No.1, father of writ petitioners 2 and 3
and son of writ petitioner No.4.
2. The facts, as gathered from the writ file, are that one Vijay Kumar Gupta, husband of writ
petitioner No.1, a shopkeeper by profession, died on 01.09.2008 due to electrocution by high
intensity electric line, which had fallen down on the pathway when he went to morning walk in the
park alongside the bank of canal at Rajpura Chungi, Jammu. Accordingly, FIR No.139/2008 was

registered at Police Station, Nowabad, Jammu under Section 304-A RPC against the concerned
officials of Power Development Department. Writ petitioners filed OWP No.975/2008 seeking
compensation from the writ respondents-appellants herein on account of negligence on the part of
writ respondents.
3. The learned Single Judge while allowing the writ petition vide judgment dated 17.03.2021 held
that the writ petitioners are entitled to rupees ten lacs. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants-writ
respondents have filed the instant appeal.
4. Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties, considered their rival contentions and also
perused the appeal file. Record of writ petition was also called from the Registry.
5. The stand of appellants-writ respondents is that the writ petitioners filed OWP No.975/2008 on
06.12.2008 seeking compensation and, if any consideration was required under the policy, the same
was required to be dealt with in terms of Government Order No.328-PDD of 2011 dated 24.11.2011,
whereby an ex-gratia relief of rupees three lacs had been allowed in case of death of a civilian due to
electrocution. However, the learned Single Judge allowed rupees ten lacs as compensation in favour
of writ petitioners while relying upon Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019,
whereby an ex-gratia relief of rupees ten lacs has been allowed in case of death of a civilian due to
electrocution. The further stand of appellants-writ respondents is that since the order dated
24.10.2019 (supra) does not have retrospective effect and the incident-in-question was of
September, 2008; as such the learned Single Judge was wrong in allowing rupees ten lacs as
compensation in favour of writ petitioner.
6. Admittedly, deceased Vijay Kumar Gupta is stated to be died on 01.09.2008 due to electrocution
and the writ respondents in their objections have not disputed the same. The writ respondents in
their objections to the writ petition have specifically admitted that deceased Vijay Kumar Gupta
came into contact with the snapped conductor which was lying there on the pathway and the panel
had failed to trip and that the lapse had also been verified by the Director, TTI & C; meaning thereby
there was gross negligence on the part of officials/officers of Power Development Department which
took away a precious human life, who may not be anything for the writ respondents or anyone else,
but, certainly, he was a whole world for his family. Further, when the writ petition came to be
decided by the learned Single Judge, Government Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019 had
already been issued. Therefore, Government Order No.328-PDD of 2011 dated 24.11.2011 cannot be
read in isolation, when order dated 24.10.2019 had already been issued.
7. Further, when the writ respondents failed to consider the claim of writ petitioners for grant of
compensation on account of death of Vijay Kumar Gupta due to electrocution due to the negligence
of officials/officers of Power Development Department, the writ petitioners had no option but to
approach this Court. The writ petition came to be filed in the year 2008 and during the pendency of
the petition the Government has issued Order No.454-F of 2019 dated 24.10.2019 enhancing the
compensation in such cases from rupees three lacs to rupees ten lacs. The writ petitioners have been
hankering for getting the compensation for the last more than fourteen years and, in these
circumstances, the writ petitioners are entitled to the higher amount in terms of order dated

24.10.2019.
8. Further, the writ respondents perhaps have forgotten that the deceased at the time of his death
was only 48 years old and was an income tax payee. Also, order dated 24.10.2019 is a beneficial
order issued by the Government in larger public interest with an objective to provide
dignified/sufficient monetary support to the families of such victims so as to save them from living a
destitute life. Also, from the year 2008 to the year 2023 the inflation has been raised to many folds.
Therefore, the learned Single Judge was right in allowing interest at the rate of 6% from the date of
filing of this petition.
9. Viewed thus, while upholding the judgment of learned Single Judge, we do not find any merit in
the appeal and the same is, accordingly, dismissed along with connected CM.
