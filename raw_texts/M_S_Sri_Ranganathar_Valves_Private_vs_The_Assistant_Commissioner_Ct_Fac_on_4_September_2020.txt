COMMON ORDER
With the consent of both the parties, the present Writ Petitions are heard today through Video
Conferencing.

M/S.Sri Ranganathar Valves Private ... vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) (Fac) on 4 September, 2020
2. The above Writ Petitions relate to restriction of the amount of Input Tax Credit (ITC) claimed in
Form W for the months of June to September 2014 for separate orders for every month. The
restriction of the amount of Input Tax Credit has been done predominantly on the head of (a) Prior
sufferance of Taxes; (b) ITC on reversal on wastage; and (c) Ineligible claim of ITC on goods.
3. Insofar as the restriction of the amount for prior sufferance of taxes, the Assessing Officer was of
the view that some of the sellers from whom the petitioner had purchased the goods had not paid
tax to the Government. This issue has been dealt with in the case of Assistant Commissioner (CT),
presently Thiruverkadu Assessment Circle, Kolathur, Chennai Vs. Infiniti Wholesale Ltd., reported
in [2017] 99 VST 341 (Mad), wherein it has held that http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.28003 to
28005 & 28008 & 28011 of 2018 Input Tax Credit cannot be disallowed on the ground that the seller
has not paid tax to the Government, when the purchaser is able to prove that the seller has collected
tax and issued invoices to the purchaser. As such, restriction of the amount of Input Tax Credit on
this ground, cannot be sustained and requires re-consideration.
4. Insofar as the amount of restriction of Input Tax Credit claim wastages is concerned, this Court in
the case of M/s. Shri Ranganathar Valves Private Limited Vs. Assistant Commissioner (CT), (FAC),
Velandipalayam Assessment Circle, Coimbatore in the order passed in W.P.Nos.41670 to 41680 of
2016 had held as follows:-
“7. Firstly, with regard to reversal of input tax credit claim on wastage under Section
19(9) of the State Act, under which, there are two subsidiary issues namely invisible
loss and visible loss, the respondent adopted a percentage of 5% and 1% respectively.
The correctness of adopting uniform percentage came up before this Court in the case
of Interfit Techno Products Ltd. Vs. The Principal Secretary and Commissioner of CT
[reported in (2015) 81 VST 389] wherein this Court issued certain directions as to
how the Assessing Officer should proceed to determine the invisible loss / visible loss
and the operative portion of the directions http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.28003 to
28005 & 28008 & 28011 of 2018 issued is as follows :
“......
(3) For the reasons assigned, it is not sufficient for a dealer claiming refund under
Section 18(2) of the Act to show that he has paid input tax on the goods purchased;
that those goods are used in the manufacture and nothing more but there is duty
upon the dealer to satisfy the assessing authority that the claim is not hit by any of
the restrictions or conditions contained under Section 19 of the VAT Act. In this
regard, it is essential for the assessing authority to embark upon the fact finding
exercise to ascertain the quantum of loss of the goods which were purchased on
which tax was paid vis-a-vis the goods manufactured from and out of the goods
purchased and to examine as to whether they fall within any of the restrictions
contained in Section 19 of the VAT Act. The assessing officer has to conduct an
exercise by which it is to be ascertained as to whether the representation made by the
dealer is justified and is not hit by any of the restrictions and conditions contained in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/142239657/ 3
M/S.Sri Ranganathar Valves Private ... vs The Assistant Commissioner (Ct) (Fac) on 4 September, 2020
Section 19 and in particular Section 19(9) of the VAT Act.
(4) It is held that the assessing authorities are not justified in adopting uniform
percentage as invisible loss and calling upon the dealer to reverse the input tax credit
availed of to that extent.
Consequently, all notices issued to the petitioner for http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.28003 to
28005 & 28008 & 28011 of 2018 reopening and all consequential order passed reversing the input
tax credit to the extent of either four per cent or five per cent or on ad hoc percentage stands set
aside. However, liberty is granted to the concerned assessing officer to issue appropriate show cause
notices to the petitioners clearly setting out under what circumstances they propose to revise or call
upon the petitioner to reverse refund sanctioned and after inviting objections proceed in accordance
with law.”
8. Thus to ascertain as to whether there are quantum of loss of goods, which were purchased, on
which, tax was paid, the Assessing Officer has to conduct an exercise, by which, he has to ascertain
as to what would be the loss and uniform or ad hoc percentage cannot be adopted. To do so, it would
be necessary for the Assessing Officer to conduct an inspection of the place of business of the
petitioner to acquaint himself with the manufacturing process. However, since the respondent had
adopted a uniform percentage, the same calls for interference.”
5. Likewise, the restriction of the amount of Input Tax Credit for http://www.judis.nic.in
W.P.No.28003 to 28005 & 28008 & 28011 of 2018 ineligible claim of Input Tax Credit on goods is
also dealt with in the aforesaid decision in M/s.Shri Raganathar Valves' case (supra) in the following
manner:-
“9. With regard to the second issue wherein the respondent rejected the claim for
input tax credit on certain purchases effected on the ground that the commodities
were not exported is concerned, the petitioner's case is that those products are used
in the manufacture of other goods, which are exported, as specified under
Sub-Section (1) of Section 8 of the State Act and they are entitled to avail the input
tax credit. However, the petitioner had no opportunity to put forth their objections on
the above head”.
6. In view of the decisions in Shri Ranganathar Valves (supra), it would be appropriate to call for
objections of the petitioners in this regard.
7. In the light of the above findings, the impugned orders are set aside and the issue with regard to
restriction of the amount of Input Tax Credit for prior sufferance of taxes is remanded back to the
http://www.judis.nic.in W.P.No.28003 to 28005 & 28008 & 28011 of 2018 Assessing Officer for
fresh consideration. The Assessing Officer shall, before taking a final decision, extend due
opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner and endeavour to complete the proceedings, atleast
within a period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

8. In view of the judgment of this Court in Shri Ranganathar Valves (supra), it is open to the
Assessing Officer to issue a show cause notice to the petitioner calling for his objections with regard
to “Input Tax Credit on reversal on wastage” and “Ineligible claim of ITC on goods” are concerned.
9. The Writ Petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
