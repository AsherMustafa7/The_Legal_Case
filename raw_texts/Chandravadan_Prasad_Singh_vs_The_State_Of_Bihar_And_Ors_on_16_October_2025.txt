submits that the respondents were directed to recognize the petitioners' school as Project School for
all purposes and accordingly, the Letters Patent Appeal No. 1754 of 2015 preferred by the State
Government was also dismissed by Hon'ble Division Bench holding that the entire action was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128597651/ 6
Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
30.06.2018.
Submission on behalf of the Counsel of Writ Petition being CWJC No.- 5189 of 2020.
15. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that petitioners No.- 1, 2 and 3 were appointed by
the Managing Committee of the school on the post of teachers in Mathematics, Physics, History and
English subjects respectively. All the three petitioners submitted their joining on the opening day of
the school and from the status report sent by the District Education Officer, Samastipur to the
school indicates the name of all these petitioners working as Teachers/Employees of the school by
placing their names at Serial No. 2, 4 and 3, which would borne out from Annexure-7 of the writ
application. The Secretary of Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 the School
vide Annexure-9 appended with the writ petition issued a list of Teaching and Non-teaching
Employees, in which the name of the petitioners finds place at Serial Nos. 3, 4 and 5 respectively. On
02.12.2007, the Secretary of the School issued show-cause to the petitioner No.-2, who submitted
his show-cause through registered post. The petitioner No.-1 is said to have retired in the month of
January, 2018, while petitioner no. 2 got retired in the month of February, 2016 and similarly, the
petitioner no. 3 got superannuated in the month of September, 2010. In view of the order passed by
the Hon'ble High Court in CWJC No. 1887 of 2008 dated 20.12.2013, against which an Appeal
preferred by the State Government being Letters Patent Appeal No.- 1754 of 2015 having been
dismissed and further SLPs preferred against the order passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench, also
having been dismissed, the State Government granted recognition to the school in question, where
these petitioners are said to have discharged their duties.
16. It has next been submitted that District Education Officer submitted a wrong report prepared on
the basis of forged and fabricated document questioning their appointments which would borne out
from the fact that the report dated 30.06.2018 appended as Annexure-14 to the writ Patna High
Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 petition is contrary to its earlier report dated
09.04.1991 appended as Annexure-7 to the writ petition issued by the same authority i.e., the
District Education Officer, Samastipur.
17. It has next been submitted that the report dated 30.06.2018 (Annexure-14) is also contrary to
the status report dated 20.05.2007 appended as Annexure-9, to the writ petition issued by the
Secretary of the then Managing Committee of the School. The services of only three employees of the
school were culled out on pick and choose basis, which are said to have been approved vide
Annexure-15 of the writ petition and further vide order dated 24.08.2018 (Annexure-1 to the writ
petition), the grievances/claims of the petitioners were rejected, which is impugned in this case.
18. Learned counsel for the petitioners further submits that the impugned order would go to show
that while rejecting the claim of the petitioners, a report dated 30.06.2018 (Annexure-14 to the writ
petition) was relied upon and unilaterally, without causing any explanation or show cause to the
petitioners, their appointments have been found to be based on forged/manipulative documents
and no hearing of any kind known to law was ever afforded before arriving to the conclusion, which
findings have also been incorporated in the Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt.
16-10-2025 impugned order and therefore, the action of the respondents being illegal, arbitrary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128597651/ 7
Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
deserves to be interfered with for the ends of justice.
19. In CWJC No. 5650 of 2019, CWJC No. 6684 of 2019 and CWJC No. 5189 of 2020, all these
petitioners have approached this Court challenging the office order dated 24th August, 2018 passed
by the Director, Secondary Education, Bihar, Patna holding inter alia in the case of some of the
petitioners, that they were absent unauthorizedly and therefore, they are not entitled to get any
financial benefit even though they were in service since the date of taking over. Whereas, in some of
the cases despite having recognized the services with effect from the cut-off date, still by misreading
the resolution, they have not been found to be entitled to get any benefits of payment and other
consequential allowances, after the said school have been declared as Project School of the
Government on the basis of decision taken by the Bihar State Cabinet on 15 th June, 2018.
20. It is evident from the fact that this Court in CWJC No. 18887 of 2008 directed the State
Government to treat the school, where these petitioners used to work on the post of Assistant
Teachers as Project School for all purposes but the Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt.
16-10-2025 State Government preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of this Court being
LPA No. 1754 of 2015 which stood dismissed on contest and subsequently, the order of the Appellate
Court was challenged before the Hon'ble Apex Court through Special Leave Petition (Civil) Diary
No. 3386/2018 which also stood dismissed.
21. Thus, in view of the affirmation by the higher courts, the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench
in CWJC No. 18887 of 2008 reached to its finality and pursuant thereof, the State Government
through the Education Department passed the following Order: -

Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
22. The above decision clearly shows that the school, where these petitioners used to work as
Teaching and Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 Non-Teaching staff was
treated as a project school w.e.f 1 st of January, 1989. It is also not in dispute that some of the
petitioners have been working in the said school prior to the recognition as project school by the
State Government w.e.f. 01.01.1989. Still, the concerned authority did not consider the petitioners'
claim for financial benefits and other consequential reliefs on the basis of decision of State Cabinet
notified through the department of Education, Government of Bihar dated 15.06.2018 on the
ground that the said school was recognized as Project School since 01.01.1989 and therefore, the
cut-off date so given operates as a bar from consideration of their cases who were appointed after
the cut-off date, is wholly misconceived.
23. The findings which are said to have been recorded in the impugned order by holding some of
petitioners to be absent or to be working after recognition of the said school as Teacher of project
school w.e.f 01.01.1989, the petitioners of such classified groups were heard before passing the order
of termination by the then management is not forthcoming from the stipulation made in the
impugned order, and unilaterally, such decisions is said to have been recorded in the impugned
order, while from the report of District Education Officer, Samastipur dated 30.06.2018 appended
as Annexure-6, which is Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 contained in
Letter No.- 230 dated 30.06.2018, it would transpire that the petitioner, namely, Ramchandra
Chaudhary was appointed on 02.01.1984 as Physical Teacher, submitted his joining on 02.01.1984,
petitioner No.-2, Ram Kishore Singh was appointed in the subject of History on 02.01.1984,
submitted his joining on the same date, Petitioner No.-3, Chandralekha Kumari was appointed on
02.01.1984 in the subject of English, she also joined on same date, Chandravadan Prasad Singh was
appointed on 05.08.1988 and joined on 06.08.1988 in the subject of Sanskrit, Kumkum Kumari was
appointed on 05.08.1988 and joined on 07.08.1988 in the subject of Home Science/History, Pranita
Kumari was appointed on 24.12.1992 and joined on 30.12.1992 in the subject of History, Shiv
Kumar Singh, was appointed on 24.12.1993 and joined on 30.12.1993 in the subject of Mathematics,
Shabnam Kumari, was appointed on 07.11.1995 and joined on the same date in the subject of
English, Prabhat Kumar was appointed on 20.12.1992 and he joined on 24.12.1992 as Night Guard.
With respect to Pranita Kumari, Shiv Kumar Singh, Shabnam Kumari, Prabhat Kumar and others,
they have been found to be working in the said school on the date of such inspection as per report
prepared by the District Education Officer, Samastipur in Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of
2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 the year 2018.
24. From perusal of the impugned letter No.-
125P dated 24.08.2018, it is not forthcoming that these petitioners were given hearing at any point
of time before issuance of impugned order, whereby their claims of approval of services on the post
of teacher in respective subjects in Ram Karan Thakur Project Balika Uchha Vidyalaya, Imansarai,
Patori, Samastipur have been rejected on the ground that they obtained their appointment on the
basis of forged documents.
25. The counter affidavit filed by the respondents in all these writ petitions, the factum of violation
of principles of natural justice before taking impugned decision has not been disputed by any of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128597651/ 9
Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
respondent's counsel referring to the stand taken in their responses filed in the respective writ
petitions. The fact that all these petitioners were very much in service in the said school which was
later on, recognized as a Project School in the year 2018 from a retrospective date, is an undisputed
fact, which needs consideration in law.
26. The Resolutions of the Government do entitle them to receive financial benefits of the Project
School relating to their salary and pensionary benefits as per extant rules for the period during
which they are said to have Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 discharged
their duties validly, as is evident from the reports appended with the writ petitions in their
respective petition kept in Letter No.- 230 dated 30.06.2018, which do recognize their services in
the said school but the impugned letter by which the services are said to have not been recognized
prior to the cut-off date in the case of some of the petitioner is apparently contrary to the reports
prepared by the respondents themselves. Furthermore, the impugned letter which recognizes their
services even after cut-off date for which the respondents cannot be allowed to refuse payment of
salary of Project Teacher, as the same is contrary to their own policy decision dated 15.06.2018 and
the judgment and orders passed by a co-ordinate bench of this Hon'ble Court passed in CWJC
No.-4786 of 2020 (Veena Kumari versus The State of Bihar & Ors.) and CWJC No.- 11928 of 2015
(Lal Bahdur Rai versus The State of Bihar & Ors.), where the Hon'ble Court has held that since the
name of these petitioners finds place in the list prepared by the authority concerned and they have
been found to be in service prior to the date of taking over of the school as project school and the
decisions of the State Government do provide for all consequential benefits from the date of its
recognition and accordingly, the petitioners of the aforesaid writ petitions were Patna High Court
CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 allowed the said benefits for the period they remained in
service.
27. The Other grounds for rejecting the claim of the petitioners, which is incorporated in the order
impugned dated 24.08.2018 holding the respective petitioners to be absent from the duties
unauthorizedly and during the course of hearing additionally, the respondents submitted that the
writ petition should not be entertained due to delay and laches in approaching this Court. The first
ground of unauthorized absent leading to termination of services by the managing committee as
indicated in the impugned order with respect to some of the petitioners does not indicate that the
aggrieved petitioner before issuance of termination order were heard following Principles of Natural
Justice and therefore, the said issues are left open, to be agitated by the aggrieved petitioners at
appropriate forum provided the factum of termination of their services, so recorded in the
impugned order, are found to be correct and based on record. But, in so far, with regard to the
payment of salary of all these petitioners are concerned, as against the period they remained in
service, the ground of delay and latches are not acceptable for the simple reason that the cause of
action for filing the writ petitions only accrued in favour of these petitioners, after the impugned
order Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 was passed and the disputes with
respect to their services have been raised without adhering the principles of natural justice and
therefore, the grounds raised to hold the writ petitions to have vitiated in law on the ground of delay
and laches, cannot be accepted and is accordingly, rejected.

Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
28. In view of the above, since, it is not in dispute that these petitioners have worked in the School
either in the teaching cadre or in the non-teaching cadre in respective capacities, while some of them
have worked even prior to the cut-off date i.e., 01.01.1989, and some of them have been appointed
after the cut-off date, but from the records of different writ petitions including the stand taken
therein, the fact remains that these petitioners were much in service before the recognition having
been granted by the State Government i.e., on 24.08.2018 and the reasons assigned to deny the
benefits is apparently in breach of the objectives stipulated in the Resolution issued by the state
Government.
29. Since these petitioners have worked between these periods i.e from 01.01.1989 to 24.08.2018
with full sincerity and diligently and their services rendered during the period, which is duly
recognized by the respondents themselves during the spot verification carried out in the year 2018
itself, Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 just before granting recognition
to the said school as a Project School. In such view of the matter, the entitlement of these petitioners
to the financial benefits and other consequential benefits as an Employee of Project School either in
the capacity of Teaching or Non-teaching employees cannot be denied and accordingly, the
Impugned Letter as contained in Memo No.- 125P dated 24.08.2018 being common in CWJC
No.-5650 of 2019, CWJC No.-6684 of 2019 and CWJC No.-5189 of 2020 are absolutely
unsustainable and the decision of the respondents' authorities in not accepting the claim to grant
financial benefits is wholly unjustified.
30. In view of the above, the claim of the writ petitioners of CWJC No.-6290 of 2019, who are also
said to be appointed after the cut-off date i.e., 01.01.1989 and have continuously been discharging
their duties are also entitled to regularization as against the posts, which are said to be vacant as
their cases are covered by the judgment rendered by Hon'ble Division Bench in LPA No. 145 of 2015
(Yugal Kishore Ray v. The State of Bihar & Ors) wherein the directions have been issued to absorb
the appellant of the aforementioned appeal who was already in service as against the posts, which
was said to be created w.e.f. 04.02.1989, while in the instant case, the posts Patna High Court CWJC
No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 against which the petitioners are said to be working are vacant
but for unexplained reasons the absorption has not been done in their favour.
31. An employee is entitled to get financial benefits with all protection during his/her services till the
date of continuation on their respective posts. When the Education Department declared the
concerned school as a Project School with retrospective effect, the teacher and non-teaching staffs
who had been working during the said period becomes entitled to get benefits of such period. From
the material on record, this Court is of the opinion that as per the resolution dated 15.6.2018, it is
very clear, insofar as it clearly stipulates that the school is taken over with effect from 1.1.1989 with
all consequential monetary benefits being payable to the employees and admittedly, it is also not in
dispute that the name of the writ petitioners of CWJC No.-5650 of 2019, CWJC No.-6684 of 2019
and CWJC No.-5189 of 2020 do figure in the list of the employees found to be working by the
respondents as would be evident from various list prepared like of the year 1991 by the then District
Education officer, Samastipur and finally in the year 2018, by the then District Education officer,
Samastipur in compliance of direction and order passed by the Co-ordinate Patna High Court CWJC
No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 Bench. Thus, in the opinion of this Court, the rejection of their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128597651/ 11
Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
case for monetary benefits and pensionary benefits on ground that some were appointed after the
date of takeover of their school as project school retrospectively or had already retired before the
date of consideration of their cases and in the case of some of the petitioner, their services were
terminated owing to their unauthorized absence found by the then Managing Committee are not
sustainable in law and deserves to be interfered with, in order to protect the Constitutional rights of
these petitioners.
32. Since these petitioners have worked during the period while the school was not recognized as a
Project School and it was only recognized in the year 2018 retrospectively and therefore, the past
service including the present services of the respective petitioners are required to be recognized for
the purpose of grant of financial benefits and accordingly, their claims deserves to be considered in
true perspective so that the interest of these teachers, who have been serving with the school prior to
the recognition as Project School or after the recognition, are not prejudiced in any manner.
33. From the records, it appears that the report Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt.
16-10-2025 prepared by the District Education Officer, Samastipur as contained in letter no. 230
dated 30.06.2018 in which altogether 15 teaching and non-teaching staffs are shown to be working
on 28.06.2018, out of which, the services of five teaching and non- teaching staffs have been
approved, as such, the contention of the Respondents that in the said report there is a manipulation
is wholly misconceived and unacceptable and therefore, the determination of the rights of these
petitioners are required to be made in similar terms to that of the other five teaching and non-
teaching staffs, which are said to have been made by the Respondents themselves by issuing office
order as contained in Memo No. 105 dated 04.07.2018, which is appended as Annexure-7 Series to
the writ petition being CWJC No. 5650 of 2019. The State authorities being modal employer cannot
be allowed to approbate and reprobate at the same time and the documents are required to be read
as whole for the purpose of determining the rights of all the similarly situated persons.
34. In view of the above discussions, the impugned letter as contained in Memo No.-125P dated
24.08.2018 appended with the aforesaid writ petitions, is set aside and the following directions are
being issued:-
Directions with respect to the petitioner of Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of
2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 CWJC No.-5650 of 2019:-
35. Since the report dated 30.06.2018 prepared by the District Education Officer,
Samastipur in compliance of direction issued in CWJC No. 18887 of 2008 has
already been acted upon, as five persons out of the list of 15 teaching and
non-teaching staffs shown to be working in the said school, whose services have been
approved and consequential benefits have been granted and the name of this
petitioner finds place at serial no.6 showing his joining on 06.08.1988 and the
document appended with the supplementary counter affidavit showing his
deputation lastly been made and relieved to join the school on 11th of April, 2020
which has not been confronted by any of the respondents either through any counter
affidavit or otherwise, therefore, this petitioner is also entitled to his salary and other

Chandravadan Prasad Singh vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 16 October, 2025
consequential benefits from 06.08.1988 to 11th April 2020.
36. In view of the above, this Court is of the opinion that the deputation could have
only been made by the Bihar School Examination Board, when the petitioner would
have been found to be serving in the said school and therefore, the stand of the
respondent that there is a manipulation in the date of appointment is wholly
unacceptable and, therefore, this Court is of the view that at least from the date of
first deputation Patna High Court CWJC No.5650 of 2019(8) dt. 16-10-2025 by the
Bihar School Examination Board which is an uncontroverted document, from which
date the petitioner is required to be recognized as a teacher serving in the said school
and is entitled for payment of salary with all the consequential benefits till the date of
relieving i.e., 11.04.2020. considering the aforesaid facts, this Court by treating the
petitioner to have retired in the month of April on 30.04.2020, accordingly, directs
the respondents to pay all consequential benefit to the petitioner from 01.01.1989 to
30.04.2020 within a period of four months from the date of communication/receipt

on 20.12.1992 in the same school and joined on 24.12.1992 as against the sanctioned post and since
then he is discharging his duty in the said school. Undisputedly, the appointments of all these four
petitioners are said to have been made after the school was taken over under the decision of the
State Government from the retrospective date on 01.01.1989 and since the petitioners are working
till today, the authorities are required to pay salary attached to the post by absorbing them against
the vacant sanctioned post in terms of Judgment and order passed in LPA No. 145 of 2015, in
similar terms from the dated of their joining as indicated aforesaid on the respective posts.
Directions with respect to the petitioner of CWJC No. 6684 of 2019.

in terms of Hon'ble Apex Court's order passed in Civil Appeal No(s) 7841 of 2011 in the case of Man
