revealed that he voluntarily joined the KYKL outfit from the month of march 2003 through one

training Centre at Chandel Distirct, Manipur. Mr. H.Samarjit, learned PP further state that from the
first week of March, 2003, the 16" Batch Basic Military Training of the Outfit was commenced at
Chalong Training Centre, Chandel district. Altogether around 300 above new recruits, including 20
females and the accused person took part in the Basic Military Training (BMT). The party allotted
him Army No. 208, before his completion of BMT. During the BMT training, while he was attending
the training in the month of April, 2003. He fired one live round of 303, Rifles near the Training
Centre located at Chalong, Chandel district without the permission from his seniors officers In this
connection, the Higher Authority of the KYKL outfit terminated him from the Party; he did his BMT
only for about 2 Â½ two and half months. Thereafter, he left the Outfit from the training Centre and
remained at home with his parents at Heirok,Part- 2,Bazar,Thoubal. After he left the KYKL Outfit,
he remained at home with his family engaging in cultivation of food crops and other domestic
activities. On 16.04.2023, he went to Leisan Tampak, Sangaikot to meet one of his friend namely
Mr. James Singh (24), R/o Leisan Tampak. When he reached Leisan Tampak, Sangaikot, a team of
36" Assam Rifles arrested him for being an ex-cadre of KYKL Outfit. No incriminating
items/documents was recovered from his possession. However, details about his activities is
uncertain and couldn't be confirmed from the investigation carried out so far. Further investigation
can only ascertain if the accused have actually still link with the KYKL Outfit or he have been
reintroduced into the society by UG groups to carry out subversive activities. Investigation is still
going on to find out concrete details about the accused person. [12] By narrating above the facts, Mr.
H.Samarjit, learned PP represented before this Court that the investigation is still pending and the
prosecution not at all investigates further in this matter and the same is going on to find out the
concrete details about the accused person and at this stage, if the accused person is released on bail,

Saikhom Sanayaima@ Nongdren vs The Officer In Charge on 6 October, 2023
the accused/petitioner may tamper the witnesses and interfere with the investigation. Therefore, H.
Samarjit, learned PP for the State respondents has strongly opposed for granting bail on the ground
that because of the petitioner has long incarceration is not the ground for releasing the petitioner. In
the circumstances, he prayed this Court to dismiss the application.
[13] Considering the argument advanced by both the counsels for the parties, this Court considered
that in para 5 of the counter affidavit dated 04.10.2023, the respondents prosecution himself has
admitted that the petitioner has left KYKL outfit and remained at home with his family engaging in
cultivation of food crops and other domestic activities and the prosecution also says that details
about his activities is uncertain and could not be confirmed from the investigation carried out so far.
[14] Apart from this, the petitioner is in jail from 16.04.2023. Till then, almost 5 months he is in
judicial custody and the investigation is still going on . If this Court is considered the bail application
in favour of the petitioner on condition, no prejudice will be caused to the respondent Police.
[15] Therefore, I am inclined to pass the following order,
(a) Bail Application No.14 of 2023 is allowed and the petitioner is ordered to be enlarged on bail in
connection with FIR No.02(04)2023 SKT-PS under Section 121/121 - AIPC & 20 UA (P) Act on the
