CORAM: HON'BLE SHRI JUSTICE S.PUJAHARI
ORDER
04. 06.04.2021 This matter is taken up by video conferencing mode.
The petitioners apprehending their arrest in Sambalpur Vigilance P.S. Case No.45 of 2020,
corresponding to Bolangir V.G.R. Case No.03 of 2021, pending in the court of Special Judge
Vigilance, Bolangir, registered for alleged commission of offences punishable under Section 13(2)
read with Section 13(1)(b)/12 of the P.C.Act, have filed this petition for their release on pre-arrest
bail.
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel for the Vigilance Department.
Considering the facts and submissions made, especially the submission of the learned counsel
appearing for the Vigilance Department that custodial interrogation of the petitioners is not
required for collection of further evidence or their bail is not an impediment to free and fair
investigation, inasmuch as they are cooperating with the investigation, coupled with the fact that
nothing is there on record indicating the fact that the petitioners shall abscond and/or tamper with
the prosecution evidence, if released on pre-arrest bail, I am of the view that this is a fit case to
enlarge the petitioners on pre-arrest bail.
Hence, this Court directs that in the event of arrest of the petitioners in connection with the
aforesaid case, they be released on bail by the Officer effecting arrest on such terms and conditions
as deemed just and proper including the condition that they shall cooperate with the investigation as
and when directed.
The ABLAPL is, accordingly, disposed of being allowed.
