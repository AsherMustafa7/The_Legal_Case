Nos.
ORDER
(Jabalpur, dtd.25.01.2019) All these writ petitions involve a common issue, therefore, they are being
heard analogously and decided concomitantly by a common order.
2. These petitions have been preferred by the petitioners who are working as Lecturers, Upper
Division Teachers (UDT), Varishtha Adhyapaks and Adhayapaks [hereinafter referred to as "the
candidates"] in Government Model Schools and Schools of Excellence [for short "the SOE"]
challenging the legality and propriety of the Circulars/Instructions issued by the respondents, dated
3-7-2017, 12-7-2017, 24-7-2018 and the communication dated 27-8-2018, whereby the respondents
are conducting Online Examination of the teachers of the respective cadre deployed in the Model
Schools/SOE, in order to enhance the quality of education in the aforesaid educational institutions
by selecting eligible and competent teachers working in the School Education Department.
3. For the sake of clarity and convenience, and in order to avoid repetition, the facts adumbrated in
W.P. No.17138/2018 [Shailesh Pathak and others vs. State of M.P. and others] are noted. The
petitioners contend that they have been working in the Model Schools/SOE after their selection by
the Selection Committee which was conducted in the year 2010. Since they have been producing
excellent results, therefore, they cannot be compelled to participate again in the Online selection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111089089/ 2
Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
process, as they have already undergone selection process and thereafter they have been selected in
the year 2012 as well. It is submitted that no syllabus was prescribed for the Online Examination
being conducted by the respondents. It is strenuously urged that though they are producing
excellent results but, they are being asked to compete along with the teachers working in the lower
cadres, viz. Shiksha Karmis or contract teachers. In some of the petitions a challenge has also been
made to the Instruction, dated 24-7-2018 issued by the respondents after the Online Examination,
wherein it has been provided that the candidates who have qualified the Online Examination, would
be given postings in Model Schools/SOE. In the previous Circular/Instructions dated 3-7-2017, such
candidates were required to give choice of 20 Model Schools/SOE wherein they wished to get them
posted, but by the communication, dated 24-7-2018 the same has been changed and it is stipulated
that they have to give choice for posting in the Model Schools/SOE within the same districts where
they are recently posted. It is urged with vehemence that by changing the criteria of selection, the
respondents have changed the Rule of Game.
4. On the bedrock of these contentions, it is submitted that the impugned Circulars/Instructions
issued by the Government, are arbitrary and violative of Articles 14and 16 of the Constitution of
India and change of selection criteria after commencement of the selection, is contrary to the law
laid down by the Apex Court in the judgments rendered in the cases of Maharashtra State Road
Transport Corporation and others vs. Rajendra Bhimrao Mandve and others, (2001) 10 SCC 51 and
Tamil Nadu Computer Science B.Ed. Graduate Teachers Welfare Society (1) vs. Higher Secondary
School Computer Teachers Association and others, (2009) 14 SCC 517. Learned counsel for the
petitioners also referred the order passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of
Abhishek Shrivastava vs. State of M.P. and another, [W.P. No.17591/2018, dated 12-9-2018].
5. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents-State submitted that the State Government has
taken a policy-decision with regard to posting of eligible teachers (candidates) in the Model
Schools/SOE in order to provide excellent environment and quality education in the school
education keeping in view the provisions enshrined in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
Education Act, 2009 [hereafter referred to as "the Act"], the School Education Department has
established, Model Schools at the District level and Schools of Excellence (SOE) in the Block level.
The School Education Department has upgraded the schools and is running 235 Schools of
Excellence and 201 Model Schools in the State. Earlier, monitoring of Model Schools was being done
by the Central Government and now the same is being done by the State Government through
School Education Department.
6. On clarification of the query being made by this Court regarding admission in the Model Schools
and the SOE, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the admission to these schools for
41 District level Schools of Excellence and 201 Block level Model Schools in 9th Class for academic
session 2019-2020 is done by conducting admission test. He produced a copy of the communication
dated 7-01-2019, issued by the Commissioner, Public Instructions, M.P. addressed to the Director,
M.P. Open School Education Council. He also produced a copy of the Circular dated 28-7-2018
issued by the Commissioner, Public Instructions clarifying that candidates having B.Ed.
qualification be selected for posting in Model Schools and SOE. In sum and substance, the argument
is that it was a policy decision of the State to improve the quality of education in these identified
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111089089/ 3
Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
educational institutions and, therefore, a decision was taken by the respondents to introduce an
Online Examination for postings of teachers (candidates) in the Model Schools and SOE, to be
selected on merits. He argued that the Instructions issued after the Online Examination dated 28-7-
2018 does not amount to change of the Game of Rules. It deals with the procedure for counselling
and the condition of Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) qualification in addition to the Postgraduate
(PG) qualification which was introduced keeping in view the provisions of the RTE Act and NCTE
notification. It is further submitted that the State Government has framed rules for appointment of
teachers in the School Education Department working on different posts viz. Adhyapak, Varishtha
Adhyapak, Shiksha Karmis, Class-I and contract teachers etc., namely, Madhya Pradesh School
Education Service (Teaching Cadre), Service Conditions and Recruitment Rules, 2018 [hereinafter
referred to as "the Rules 2018"]. Under the said Rules the said cadre has been made a District level
cadre and the qualification of B.Ed. has been made an essential qualification. Keeping in view the
provisions envisaged in the Act, a decision was taken to select candidates having qualification of
B.Ed. for posting in Model Schools and SOE.
7. Counsel for the respondents-State, in order to substantiate his contentions referred the orders
dated 31-10-2017 passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in W. P. No.4406/2017 [Ganesh
Kalmodiya vs. School Education Department]; W.P. No.10549/2017 [Narmada Prasad Mishra and
others vs. State of M.P. and others], dated 21-11-2017; and W.P. No.17000/2018 [Suresh Singh
Sikarwar vs. School Education Department] dated 30-7-2018. He also submitted that since the
matter pertains to policy of the State Government, therefore, no interference is warranted in the writ
jurisdiction. To bolster his submission, learned counsel for the State referred to the judgments
rendered in the cases of Tamil Nadu Education Department Ministerial and General Subordinate
Services Association and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others, (1980) 3 SCC 97; State of Punjab
and others vs. Ram Lubhaya Bagga and others, (1998) 4 SCC 117; State of Himachal Pradesh and
others vs. Himachal Pradesh Nizi Vyavsayik Prashikshan Kendra Sangh, (2011) 6 SCC 597; and State
of Jharkhand and others vs. Ashok Kumar Dangi and others, (2011) 13 SCC 383.
8. Regard being had to the similitude in the present batch of writ petitions and the arguments
advanced on behalf of the parties, the cases which have cropped up for consideration, can be
summarised in three categories :
I. The teachers who are working in the Model Schools and SOE by virtue of their
posting in these schools but, have never undergone any selection process.
II. The teachers/candidates who are posted in the Model Schools and SOE after their
selection by the Selection Committee at District level in pursuant to the previous
instructions, therefore they need not to undergo a fresh selection process, as they
have produced excellent results and the object of the policy of the Government is
already achieved.
III. The writ petitioners - candidates who have participated Online selection process
introduced by the impugned Instruction dated 3-7-2017, are aggrieved with the
Circular or Instructions dated 24-7-2018 and 28-7-2018 whereby option for posting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111089089/ 4
Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
in Model Schools and SOE was changed to give option for their posting in Model
Schools and SOE situated in the same District where they are posted at present and
qualification of B.Ed. was prescribed for posting by counselling in addition to PG
qualification keeping in view the provisions of Section 23 of the Right of Children to
Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009; NCTE Notification; and M.P. School
Education Service (Teaching Cadre) Service Conditions & Recruitment Rules, 2018.
9. In regard to the first category of cases, where the candidates are posted in the Model Schools and
SOE without undergoing any kind of selection process, the learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners submitted that the petitioners are possessing the educational qualifications of PG and
B.Ed., and while their postings in the Model Schools/SOE they have produced excellent results as
well. He also referred to various documents to prove that the result produced by these teachers was
in-between 90% to 100%. Since the Government has already achieved the optimum level of
education by posting of these teachers, therefore, they cannot be compelled to undergo any further
selection process. It is also contended that the Government has introduced the policy without any
exercise, preparation and spadework. It is vehemently urged that some of the petitioners are at the
verge of retirement and at this stage, shifting of these teachers to other schools may be prejudicial to
the interest of the students and the Schools as well.
10. In the second category of the writ petitions, the candidates-teachers who have already undergone
the selection by the District Level Committee before their postings in the Model Schools/SOE, the
learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that since they had already undergone
selection process, thereof, they cannot be compelled to undergo a fresh Online
selection/examination for their posting. In this batch of writ petitions the results produced by
teachers in these schools is also referred. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners vehemently
canvassed that by holding an Online examination by the respondents, no objective would be
achieved, as the optimum level of education, is already achieved by the Government.
11. In the third category of the writ petitions, the teachers- candidates have already participated in
the Online Examination in pursuance of the Circulars dated 3-7-2017, 12-7-2017 and 24-7- 2017, are
aggrieved with the Instructions dated 24-7-2018 and 28-7- 2018, whereby the condition regarding
submissions of 20 options for postings of their choice in the schools was changed, by confining it to
give their choice for posting in the Model Schools/SOE, situated within the districts where they are
posted at present. Though the Circular/Letter dated 28-7-2018 is not challenged in the present writ
petitions but they argued that prescription of B.Ed. qualification in addition to P.G. qualification for
posting in the Model Schools/SOE is arbitrary, as it amounts to changing rule of game. The Circular
dated 28-7-2018 was produced by the learned counsel for the State.
12. Learned counsels appearing for the petitioners argued that the Instruction dated 24-7-2018
amounts to change of the rule of game. It is putforth that their choice could not have been restricted
to the district itself and, therefore, they should have been permitted to give option for 20 schools -
Model Schools/SOE in the entire State. The curtailment of submission of choice is arbitrary and
violative of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, the impugned
circulars/instructions are illegal, arbitrary and capricious.

Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
13. I do not find any force in the aforesaid contentions portrayed on behalf of the petitioners. The
substantive posts of the writ petitioner are Lecturers, Shiksha Karmi, Grade-I, Varishtha Adhyapak,
Pradhan Adhyapak, Samvida Shiksha Varg - I, Shikshak (UDT) and Adhyapak. The respondents
have specifically pleaded that by posting of these teachers/writ petitioners in the Model Schools/
SOE, no special right is created in their favour and such teachers who are appointed in the Model
Schools/SOE, will not get any special allowance or incentives. It is also submitted that the
questioned Online examination will not affect the service conditions and avenue of promotion etc. of
the teachers. The relevant part of the Circular, dated 3-7-2017 reads as under:

14. Learned counsel for the State also submitted that in some posting orders the word "on
deputation" has been used, which is nothing but wrong dispel of the word "posting", as teachers are
not on deputation in the Model Schools/ SOE. He putforth that the State Government has issued a
policy on 31st March 2002 regarding identification of the Schools of Excellence. Initially,
monitoring of the Model Schools was being done by the Government of India, later the same is
entrusted to the State Government. The schools have been upgraded as Schools of Excellence (SOE)
and Model Schools in the State to cater the needs for better performing of the students, who are
admitted in these Schools through a test, therefore, there is ardent need to post suitable teachers in
order to impart quality education. They are not conferred any special benefits of allowance,
incentives and promotion and their service conditions and promotional avenues remain intact. They
are initially posted for two years and it is extendable for further one year, subject to
recommendation of the Screening Committee and if a teacher further wishes to continue in such
schools, he will have to participate in the Online Examination.
15. The writ petitions were filed at different stages of the Online Examination. In some petitions
interim order was passed allowing the writ petitioners to appear in the Online Examination,
however, the same was made subject to final outcome of the petitions. The respondents have stated
that 10380 candidates had appeared in the examination and out of the existing 3744 teachers 1526
teachers who are already working in these schools, appeared in the Online Examination. Thus, the
Online Examination, pursuant to the Circular dated 3-7-2017, has already taken place. In some
places posting orders could not be issued because of the interim orders.
16. Coming back to the challenge of the Circulars dated 3-7- 2017, 12-7-2017 and 24-7-2018, it is
luminescent that the teachers/candidates are required to appear in the Online Examination for their
postings in the Model Schools/SOE. The said procedure does not contemplate any procedure for
recruitment or appointment. The petitioners are already in-service and they are imparting
education. The petitioners have failed to establish their any right to remain posted in the Model
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111089089/ 6
Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
Schools/SOE. The transfer and posting of an employee is in the absolute domain of the employer. It
is a pure administrative matter. It is settled law that transfer and posting is an incident of service
and the courts cannot interfere with the transfer or posting, unless the same is in violation of any
statutory rules. The Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. and another vs. Siya Ram and
another, (2004) 7 SCC 405 held that an employee should be posted where it has to be decided by the
employer and an employee has no right to claim posting at a particular place. The relevant extract
reads as under:-
"5. The High Court while exercising jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India had gone into the question as to whether the transfer was in the
interest of public service. That would essentially require factual adjudication and
invariably depend upon peculiar facts and circumstances of the case concerned. No
government servant or employee of a public undertaking has any legal right to be
posted forever at any one particular place or place of his choice since transfer of a
particular employee appointed to the class or category of transferable posts from one
place to other is not only an incident, but a condition of service, necessary too in
public interest and efficiency in the public administration. Unless an order of transfer
is shown to be an outcome of mala fide exercise or stated to be in violation of
statutory provisions prohibiting any such transfer, the courts or the tribunals
normally cannot interfere with such orders as a matter of routine, as though they
were appellate authorities substituting their own decision for that of the
employer/management, as against such orders passed in the interest of
administrative exigencies of the service concerned. This position was highlighted by
this Court in National Hydroelectric Power Corpn. Ltd. v. Shri Bhagwan, (2001) 8
SCC 574."
17. The law relating to scope of interference in the transfer/posting matter is no longer res integra,
as held by the Supreme Court in the cases of Gujrat Electricity Board and another vs. Atmaram
Sungomal Poshani, (1989) 2 SCC 602; Union of India and others vs. S.L. Abbas, AIR 1993 SC 2444
and the judgment passed by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of R.S. Choudhary vs. State of
M.P. and others, 2007 (2) ILR MP Series 1329, the transfer is an incidence of service and the
transfer order can only be interfered by the Courts of law if the transfer is issued in violation of the
statutory rules or the order suffers from malafide exercise of power.
18. In regard to prescription of B.Ed. qualification in the counselling for posting, it is condign to
refer the Madhya Pradesh School Education Service (Teaching Cadre), Service Conditions and
Recruitment Rules, 2018 [hereinafter referred to as `the Rules 2018] which prescribe eligibility
conditions fixed as per Schedule III of the said Rules. The educational qualification as per Schedule
III appended to the Rules is Master's Degree in the relevant subject with second division and
Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) or its equivalent. The relevant extracts of the Rules read as under:
"8. Conditions of eligibility for direct recruitment. - In order to be eligible for
participating in the Teacher Eligibility Examination, a candidate must fulfil the
following conditions, namely :-

qualified who, though not possessing the qualifications prescribed in these rules, has passed the
examinations conducted by other institutions by a standard which, in the opinion of Government,
justifies the consideration of the candidate for selection.
(b) The Government on its own discretion, may consider the cases of those candidates who are
otherwise qualified but have received degree from a foreign University which is not designated as a
University recognized by the Government.

19. The aforesaid qualification has been prescribed in reference to the qualifications prescribed by
the National Council for Teacher Education, which is published in the Gazette of India, dated
12-11-2014. It contemplates that a candidate must possess such minimum qualifications as laid
down by the Academic Authority authorised by the Central Government by publishing a notification
in that behalf. Section 23 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111089089/ 8
Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
[hereinafter referred to as "the Act"] and the relevant extracts from the Notification read thus:
"23. Qualifications for appointment and terms and conditions of service of teachers.-
(1) Any person possessing such minimum qualifications, as laid down by an academic
authority, authorised by the Central Government, by notification, shall be eligible for
appointment as a teacher.
(2) Where a State does not have adequate institutions offering courses or training in
teacher education, or teachers possessing minimum qualifications as laid down under
sub-section (1) are not available in sufficient numbers, the Central Government may,
if it deems necessary, by notification, relax the minimum qualifications required for
appointment as a teacher, for such period, not exceeding five years, as may be
specified in that notification:
Provided that a teacher who, at the commencement of this Act, does not possess
minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-section (1), shall acquire such
minimum qualifications within a period of five years.
Provided further that every teacher appointed or in position as on the 31st March,
2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications as laid down under sub-section
(1), shall acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of four years from the
date of commencement of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
(Amendment) Act, 2017.
(3) The salary and allowances payable to, and the terms and conditions of service of,
teacher shall be such as may be prescribed."

20. The National Council for Teacher Education, an academic authority authorised by the Central
Government, vide Notification dated 12-11-2014 prescribed the professional qualification for
Secondary/High School (For Class IX-X) as Graduate/Post Graduate from recognized University
with at least 50% marks in either Graduation or Post Graduation (or its equivalent) and Bachelor of
Education (B.Ed.) from National Council for Teacher Education recognized institution.
21. The National Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993 provides that the B.Ed. qualification is an
essential qualification for the teachers. Thus, if the respondents have decided to post the teachers
who are having B.Ed. degree in addition to PG Degree, in the Model Schools/SOE, the same cannot
be held to be arbitrary, as it is in consonance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules 2018.
Change of option can also not be held to be arbitrary, as the post of teacher has been made a district
cadre post as per Rules 2018.
22. Thus, the respondents decided to select the candidates having B.Ed. qualification for posting in
Model Schools and SOE in view of the qualifications prescribed under the Recruitment Rules, 2018
and the Right to Children Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which cannot be held to be
illegal or arbitrary.
23. The contention of the petitioners that issuance of the impugned Instruction dated 24-7-2018 for
the first and second round of counselling, issued by the Commissioner, Public Instructions, M.P.,
Bhopal, amounts to change of Game of Rules, can also not be appreciated. The entire exercise is
being done by the respondents by issuance of the policy for posting of teachers in the Model Schools
and SOE which does not relate to any selection, therefore, the same cannot be construed to change
of Game of Rule. As already held, transfer and posting of an employee is within the domain of the
employer and, therefore, if the respondents have issued the Instructions, dated 24-7-2018 curtailing
the choice/option from the 20 educational institutions to the schools in the District, their posting
cannot be held to be arbitrary. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Suresh Singh
Sikarwar (supra), decided on 30-7-2018 examined the Circular dated 24-7-2018 dismissed the writ
petition in limine and held that there was no condition that the options were required to be given for
the entire State and confining it to the District, was found to be valid as in the Rules 2018, the
teacher is a District Cadre post.
24. The petitioners have relied on the judgment passed by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the
case of Abhishek Shrivastava (supra). The said judgment has been distinguished by another
Co-ordinate Bench of this Court at Gwalior in the case of Vinod Singh Chauhan and another vs.
State of M.P and others [W.P. No.21104/2018, dated 03-10-2018] holding that the said judgment is
per incuriam. The relevant paras of the judgment read thus:
"5. The stark distinguishing feature in the present case is that it does not involve any
process of recruitment. The policy vide Annexure-P/2 neither involves direct
recruitment nor promotion. The service conditions/benefits presently available to the
Adhayapak/Varishtha Adhyapak shall not undergo any change on their posting at
Model Schools of Excellence after being subjected to the process of Online test and
counselling.

Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
5.1 The Model Schools of Excellence are created in every district to serve as harbinger
of excellence in the field of school thereby becoming an example for other
government schools in the district with ultimate objective of enhancing the quality
eduction.
5.2 The policy vide Annexure-P/2 dated 24-7- 2018 conducts the process of Online
test and counselling merely to hand-pick the most talented amongst the Varishtha
Adhyapaks/Adhyapaks to man the Model School of Excellence in each district to take
the campaign of excellence in school education to new heights.
6. From the above discussion, this Court has no manner of doubt that the policy vide
Annexure-P/2 or P/1 is undoubtedly a policy of "posting" with no element of
recruitment involved and therefore the reliance placed by the Co-ordinate Bench in
W.P. No.17591/2018 upon the judgment of Apex Court in K. Manjusree Vs. State of
Andhra Pradesh and aother, (2008) 3SCC 512 and Anil Bhatt and others Vs. State of
M.P. and others, 2012 (2) MPLJ 82 is misplaced.
7. Accordingly, this Court with utmost humility at its command is compelled to hold
that judgment of the Co-ordinate Bench passed on 12-9-2018 is rendered by
misreading the law laid down by Apex Court in K. Manjusree Vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh and another, (2008) 3 SCC 512 and is thus per incuriam and therefore, is
denuded of its presidential value thereby relieving this Court of its obligation to
follow the same.
8. Consequently, present petition deserves to be and is therefore dismissed at the
very outset."
25. In the case of Suresh Singh Sikarwar (supra) a Co- ordinate Bench of this Court considering the
Instructions dated 24- 7-2018 held that the said Instructions are not arbitrary, as the post of
Teacher is a district cadre and, therefore, the respondents have rightly curtailed the choice of
posting to the district where the candidate is already posted. In view of the aforesaid provisions, this
Court does not find any illegality or arbitrariness in giving preference to the candidates, who are
having B.Ed. qualification in addition to Post Graduation.
26. In regard to interference in policy matters, the Apex Court in the case of Tamil Nadu Education
Department Ministerial and General Subordinate Services Association and others (supra) ruled that
in the matter of policy-decisions regarding servicing conditions, the Courts cannot adopt
mathematical precision in administrative actions not being possible and cannot analyse minute
administrative details.
27. In the case of Ram Lubhaya Bagga and others (supra) the Supreme Court has held that judicial
review in policy matter which is wisdom of the policy, cannot be judicially scrutinised, though the
Court can consider whether the policy is arbitrary or violative of law. Same view has been reiterated
in the cases of Himachal Pradesh Nizi Vyavsayik Prashikshan Kendra Sangh (supra) and Ashok

Shailendra Pratap Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 January, 2019
Kumar Dangi and others (supra).
28. In view of the aforesaid submissions, I do not find any illegality or impropriety in the impugned
Circulars/Instructions issued by the State Government from time to time regarding Online
examination for posting of teachers in the Model Schools/SOE, for the following reasons :
(i) The petitioners do not have any rights to continue their postings in the Model
Schools/SOE, as they have failed to establish any statutory right for being posted in
the aforesaid Schools.
(ii) The substantive post of the petitioners is teacher under different nomenclatures
and they are engaged for imparting education in the schools. There is no conditions
either in the appointment letter or in the Service Rules for their postings in the Model
Schools or SOE only. Therefore, there is no infringement of any fundamental rights
or statutory rights.
(iii) Service conditions of the petitioners are not adversely affected by their
non-selection in the Online examination, as it is clarified in the Instructions dated
3-7-2017 itself and no special allowance or incentives are attached to the said
postings. Therefore, their contention that non-selection and transfer from the Model
Schools/ SOE would be detrimental to their interest, has no force. Further, the
decision cannot be construed as punitive or stigmatic.
(iv) Contention of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that they are
being equated with the teachers working in the lower cadres and with the unequals
can also not be appreciated, as by the Online examination, the selection is made only
for the purpose of posting and not for any appointment or promotion. Transfer and
posting are administrative matters and are purely within the domain of the employer.
(v) Contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that Rule of Game has been
changed after commencement of the Online Examination, can also not be
appreciated, as the respondents have taken a policy-decision in order to introduce the
Online Examination only for the purpose of selection for posting in the Model
Schools/SOE, which does not consist any process of recruitment or selection.
(vi) Requirement of B.Ed. qualification for posting in Model Schools and SOE at the
time of counselling, is in consonance with the provisions enshrined in the National
Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993;
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009; and the Madhya Pradesh
School Education Service (Teaching Cadre), Service Conditions and Recruitment Rules, 2018.
(vii) In addition to the aforesaid, the scope of interference of the Court in the policy-decisions of the
Government, is very limited and the petitioners could not establish any arbitrariness or malifide.
