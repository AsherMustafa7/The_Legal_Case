order should also be passed with regard to petitioner whose case is on similar footing and
accordingly the petitioner has claimed benefit of the judgment and order passed in the case of
Radhey Shyam.
3. Learned Standing counsel though has opposed the writ petition but could not dispute the
aforesaid fact that by means of order dated 31.8.2018 the case of the petitioner for grant of
regularization from the date of initial appointment was rejected by a common order.
4. In light of the above, this Court finds that the petitioner also deserves similar treatment in as
much as by means of the common order dated 31.8.2018 the case was rejected along with the case of
Radhey Shyam and this Court vide judgment and order dated 14.11.2024 has allowed the case of
Radhey Shyam, as such, the petitioner has right to be dealt with similarly on the same facts to that of
Radhey Shyam.
5. In view of the above, the writ petition is allowed in terms of the judgment and order dated
14.11.2024 passed in Writ A No.522 of 2024 which is quoted as under:-
"1. Heard Sri Neeraj Trivedi, learned counsel for petitioner as well as learned
Standing Counsel for respondents.
2. It has been submitted by learned counsel for petitioner that petitioner had joined
on the post of Chair Reckoner on 19.02.1998 in Rajya Sampati Vibhag on ad hoc basis
by means of appointment order dated 12.02.1998 in the pay scale of Rs. 2550-3200/-
under the quota of physically challenged persons as the petitioner is blind.
3. After working for nearly 3 years, the services of the petitioner was considered for
confirmation and by means of order dated 28.12.2001 the services of the petitioner
along with other ad hoc employees were confirmed. the petitioner continued as such
till date. Surprisingly, an order dated 19.10.2010 was passed cancelling his order of
confirmation dated 28.12.2001 on the ground that at the time of his confirmation the
services of the petitioner had not been regularized and accordingly respondents
passed another order on the very next day i.e. on 20.10.2010 regularizing the services
of the petitioner with effect from the same date.
4. The petitioner being aggrieved by the fresh exercise conducted by the respondents
leading to passing of the orders dated 19.10.2010 and 20.10.2010, he approached this
Court by filling a writ petition being Writ Petition No. 28718 (SS) of 2017. The said
writ petition was disposed of in the following terms:-
"Heard.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the records it
transpires that while regularizing the services of the petitioners who are physically
disabled persons being blind, due to inadvertence instead of mentioning

Ram Prakash Pandey vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt. ... on 3 March, 2025
'regularization' the word 'confirmation' was mentioned in the order dated 28.12.2001,
therefore, it is this error which was rectified by the order dated 19.10.2010 and
accordingly another order was passed on 20.10.2010 by which they were treated as
'confirmed' with effect from 20.10.2010 after treating them as 'regularized' with effect
from 28.12.2001.
On a bare perusal of the two orders it is evident that the petitioners were to be treated
as 'regularized' by the order dated 28.12.2001, but due to error they were mentioned
as having been 'confirmed', which has been rectified as aforesaid, therefore, there is
no error in the impugned order.
As regards the contention of the petitioners that they have not been granted financial
upgradations under the Assured Progression Scheme, they may represent to the
concerned authority who shall consider the matter as per the policy applicable and
take appropriate decision in this regard within 2 months from the date a certified
copy of this order is submitted.
The petition is disposed off in the above terms."
5. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment would indicate that the Court after perusing both the orders
namely, 19.10.2010 and 20.10.2010 has interpreted the said orders in the manner that the services
of the petitioner were to be treated as regularised by means of order dated 28.10.2001 but due to
error they were mentioned as being confirmed which has been rectified by the order of this Court
and after recording the said observations, the writ petition was disposed off.
6. Accordingly, there is no doubt that after reading both the orders, this Court is of the considered
view that the services of the petitioner were in fact regularised from 28.12.2001 and confirmed w.e.f.
20.10.2010. In pursuance of judgment of this Court dated 28.10.2017, the respondents proceeded to
pass another order dated 31.08.2018 wherein contrary to the observations of this Court treating the
petitioner to have been regularized w.e.f. 20.10.2010. The petitioner in the present writ petition has
challenged the validity of the order dated 31.08.2018.
7. Learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that even otherwise considering the provisions of
Uttar Pradesh Regularization on Ad hoc Appointments (on post outside the purview of Public
Service Commission) Rules, 1979. Section 4 provides :
"Section 4: Regularization on Ad hoc Appointments -(1) Any person who :-(i) was
directly appointed on ad hoc basis on or before 30.06.1998 and is continuing in
service as such on the date of commencement of Uttar Pradesh Regularization of Ad
hoc Appointment (on post outside the purview of Public Service commission)( IIIrd
Amendment) Rule, 2001"
8. Accordingly, the petitioner having been appointed prior to the cut off date i.e. 30.06.1998 and
was fully eligible to be considered for regularization on the date i.e. 28.12.2001. Accordingly,

Ram Prakash Pandey vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Deptt. ... on 3 March, 2025
considering the judgment of this Court dated 28.11.2017 along with Rules of 1979, this Court finds
that the respondents have incorrectly interpreted the judgment and applied the Rules of 1979 in the
case of the petitioner.
9. There is no reason as to why the services of the petitioner should not be treated to have been
regularized w.e.f 28.12.2001 as per the judgment of this Court dated 28.11.2017. This Court has
further been informed that no special appeal has been filed by the State against the order dated
28.11.2017 which became final. In 2001 when the order of confirmation was passed the entire
service record of the petitioner must have been examined by the competent authority, and order was
passed when he was proved to have fulfilled all criteria. He continued as a confirmed employee till
the said order was cancelled on 19.10.2010. The Coordinate Bench of this Court has put all the above
orders in correct perspective and held that service of the petitioner stood regularized w.e.f. 2001,
and therefore this Court is of the considered view that the petitioner would be entitled for all service
benefits treating his regularization w.e.f. 2001.
9. In light of the above, the writ petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 31.08.2018 is set
aside with regard to the petitioner and the respondents are directed to treat the petitioner's services
having been regularised on. 28.12.2001 and accordingly they are directed to grant all service
benefits to which he is entitled on the said date."
6. Accordingly, the impugned order dated 31.08.2018 is set aside with regard to the present
petitioner also and the respondents are directed to treat the petitioner's services having been
regularised on 28.12.2001 and accordingly they are directed to grant all service benefits to which he
is entitled on the said date.
