C.A.V. JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE JYOTI SARAN)
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019
4/50
Date : 30-04-2019
The relief prayed by the petitioner(s) in each of the
four writ petitions is identical for they seek appropriate direction
in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents in the
Registration, Excise and Prohibition Department, Government
of Bihar together with the authorities in the Commercial Tax
Department, to refund the Value Added Tax ('VAT' for the sake
of brevity), the Excise Duties, the Bottling fee etc. which was
deposited in advance by these petitioners for the supply of India
Made Foreign Liquor ('IMFL' for the sake of brevity) to the
Bihar State Beverages Corporation Ltd. for the financial year
2016-17 but which supplies never got translated into sale by
reason of prohibition initially signaled by the New Excise
Policy, 2015 with effect from 01.04.2016, which was followed
by the enforcement of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act,
2016 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act 2016') which repealed
the Bihar Excise Act, 1915 including the amending Acts
promulgated thereunder from time to time.
While the claim of the petitioner in CWJC No.15316
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 4
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
of 2017, CWJC No.16716 of 2017 and CWJC No.514 of 2018
has been rejected vide separate order(s) passed on 16.08.2017,
inter alia, in reference to the provisions of the 'Act, 2016', in so
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019
5/50
far as the petitioner in CWJC No.13165 of 2018 is concerned, he
yet awaits a disposal and thus seeks a writ in the nature of
mandamus to such effect.
Since each of the four writ petitions raise common
grievance that they have been heard analogous and with the
consent of the parties, are being disposed of at the stage of
admission, by this common judgment.
For the sake of convenience I shall be referring to the
representational facts as noticed in the pleadings of CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 unless clarified with specific reference to the
other writ petitions.
The petitioners herein are public limited companies
engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of liquor and
held valid licence under the repealed enactment of the Bihar
Excise Act, 1915 (hereinafter referred to as the '1915 Act').
The respondent no.4, the Bihar State Beverages
Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the 'Corporation') is a
Government of Bihar Undertaking set up under the aegis of the
Registration, Excise and Prohibition Department for the purpose
of wholesale distribution of foreign liquor within the State of
Bihar. Under the scheme announced by the State, all
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 5
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
manufacturers of liquor had to supply their stocks to the
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019
6/50
respondent no.4 who in turn was vested with the responsibility
of effecting supply and distribution as per the orders/permits
issued.
The pleading on records show that a Liquor Sourcing
Policy was issued by the respondent-Corporation which set the
terms on which a manufacturing company could supply 'IMFL'
in the State of Bihar. It is acting under the Liquor Sourcing
Policy that the petitioners entered into an agreement for such
supply with the respondent-Corporation.
On 21.12.2015 the Government of Bihar announced
the New Excise Policy, 2015 which was to come into effect from
1.4.2016
whereby, the Government of Bihar showed intendment to prohibit` sale, distribution and
consumption of liquor within the State of Bihar in a phased manner. Surprisingly even after
announcement of the New Excise Policy on 21.12.2015, the Corporation issued a tender inviting
offers for supply of Indian Made Foreign Liquor, Foreign Made Foreign Liquor, Foreign Made
Foreign Wine, Beer, Low Alcoholic Beverage and wine etc., a copy of which invitation is enclosed at
Annexure 5 to the writ petition.
According to the petitioner, since such tender published, was after the announcement of the New
Excise Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 Policy, 2015 it gave an indication
that the State intended to continue with the trade, in so far as 'IMFL' Wine. 'FMFL and Beer were
concerned for the financial year 2016-17. The petitioners with such legitimate expectation, applied
for renewal of their respective licences which included bottling licence, by depositing the required
fee towards licence, bottling licence fee, blending licence fee, bond licence etc. The application
together with the fee deposited by the petitioners, was not only accepted by the Department of
Registration, Excise and Prohibition and the Department of Commercial Taxes rather the required
renewals were also issued until 02.04.2016, for the financial year 2016-17.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 6
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
While on the one hand an exercise towards issuing notice inviting tender, acceptance of licence fee,
grant of renewal was taking place, on the other hand, the Government of Bihar imposed an absolute
ban initially, on the manufacture, bottling, distribution, sale, purchase, possession and consumption
of country liquor with effect from 31.03.2016 vide gazette notification placed at Annexure 6.
The pleading on records further confirm that on the same date i.e. 31.03.2016 the Government of
Bihar passed the Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 amending amongst others, Patna High Court
CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 the provisions underlying section 19(4) of the Bihar Excise
Act, 1915. Within a few days thereafter that by a second notification dated 05.04.2016 at Annexure
8, the Government of Bihar imposed a complete ban on wholesale/retail trade in any form of liquor
as well as on consumption thereof, with immediate effect. The resultant effect of such a sudden ban
was, that the stocks supplied by the respective petitioners to the respondent- Corporation could not
be sold to the retailers within the State of Bihar. It is the complaint of the petitioners that the
respondent- State having induced the petitioners to renewals of their excise licences by inviting
tenders etc., did not even give them sufficient time to remove their stocks to other States.
Understandably, it is feeling aggrieved by such an action that the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic
Beverage Companies along with the suppliers approached this Court in CWJC No.6675 of 2016 for
questioning the notification dated 05.04.2016. A Division Bench of this Court after hearing the
parties, vide judgment and order passed on 30.09.2016 held the notification dated 05.04.2016 ultra
vires the Constitution and consequently set it aside. The judgment and order of this Court is
reported in 2016(4) PLJR 369.
The judgment of this Court was pronounced on Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017
dt.30-04-2019 30.09.2016 and within few days thereafter on 02.10.2016, the Government of Bihar
enforced the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 announcing complete prohibition of liquor and
other form of intoxicants, within the State of Bihar. It is in such circumstances that the petitioners
filed their respective applications before the respondent-authorities in the Registration, Excise and
Prohibition Department and the Commercial Taxes Department respectively for refund of the
bottling fee, licence fee, labeling registration renewal fee, 'VAT' etc. Such application was filed by the
petitioners some time in December, 2016 and which remained pending until it was rejected by order
dated 16.08.2017 in reference to the provisions of section 23 of the 'Act 2016' except the petitioner in
CWJC No.13165 of 2018. It is being aggrieved by such state of affairs that the petitioners were
constrained to move this Court through the writ petitions in question.
A counter affidavit was initially filed on behalf of the authorities of the Excise and Commercial Taxes
Department blaming the petitioners of not filing appropriate application(s) for refund of 'VAT' etc.
in reference to sections 68 to 71 of the Value Added Tax Act, 2005.
Two of the writ petitions bearing CWJC No.15316 of Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017
dt.30-04-2019 2017 and CWJC No.16716 of 2017 came up for consideration on 12.04.2018 when a
Division Bench of this Court presided by Hon'ble the Chief Justice passed the following orders:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 7
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
"The State Government has filed counter affidavit but learned Advocate General
wants further time to bring on record additional affidavit with regard to the issue in
question.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we grant four weeks' time to the State
Government to file additional counter affidavit but at the same time direct the State
Government to call the petitioners, give them an opportunity to produce documents
and other material in support of their contentions for the years 2015- 16 and 2016-17
both with regard to payment of VAT and Excise Duty and other statutory dues and
take a decision after hearing them and submit an affidavit to this Court by the next
date List the matter on 15th of May, 2018. It is directed that the affidavit should be
served on the petitioners at least a week before the next date of listing."
The said matters after being adjourned on some dates were heard on 19.07.2018 when the Division
Bench taking note of the conduct of the authorities in the Commercial Taxes Department in trying to
adjust the refund amount against the assessment orders and demand notice issued subsequently
while trying to project that no refund is actually admissible, while deprecating the stand of the
department in trying to avoid the refund, issued the following directions:
"Having considered the submission, we are of the considered view that looking to the
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 nature of grievance made
in the writ petition, we had directed the competent authority to pass an order with
regard to the amount which is to be refunded to the petitioner and thereafter we
would have granted them liberty to recover the tax, if any, in accordance with law i.e.
after issuing notice for demand, conducting the assessment proceedings, pass an
assessment order and thereafter proceed to recover in accordance with law. Instead
of doing so, the officers concerned have devised a noble method. At one hand, they in
a vague manner, determined the amount to be refunded to the petitioners and on the
other hand conduct the assessment proceedings totally disregarding the statutory
provision and in violation thereof.
We do not approve of such an attitude of the officers. Before taking action in the
matter, we direct the counsel for the State to seek instructions as to how and under
what circumstances this action was taken by the officer concerned and we warn them
that if we are not satisfied with their explanation, we would take coercive action
including the action for contempt against the officers concerned.
As a matter of last indulgence, we direct for listing of the matter on 31st of July, 2018
with a hope that the offices shall determine the question of refund to the petitioners,
pass an appropriate order for refund and thereafter reserve their right to recover the
tax due in accordance with law after following the due process as is contemplated
under the statute.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 8
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
A copy of this order be given to the counsel representing the State Government for
necessary compliance.
List on 31st of July, 2018."
The matter was adjourned to 31st of July, 2018 and on which date an adjournment was asked by the
learned State Counsel which was objected to by the learned counsel appearing Patna High Court
CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 for the petitioners and they expressed apprehension that the
State Government in the garb of review may conduct assessment for the earlier year to frustrate the
claim of the petitioners for refund. This Court granted 7 days time to the State Government to
consider all issues but not to take any arbitrary action as regarding the assessment and even if
assessment is carried out after following due process of law, it would not frustrate the claim of the
petitioners for refund which had to be paid in accordance with law.
The two writ petitions referred to above, were joined by the remaining two petitions i.e. CWJC
No.13165 of 2018 and CWJC No.514 of 2018, which have been heard analogous when the matter was
next taken up on 10.08.2018. This Court took notice of the assurance given by the learned Advocate
General regarding the exercise made by the respondents to quantify the refund which, according to
him, was surely to be paid to the petitioners within six weeks next, positively. The Bench reposing
trust in the assurance given by the learned Advocate General, adjourned the matter until 03.10.2018
allowing time to the respondent authorities in the Registration, Excise and Prohibition Department
and the Commercial Taxes Department to make payment of the admissible refunds to the
petitioners. Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 Undisputedly, in between this
period though some refunds have been made but substantially the petitioners yet await the refund of
the remaining amount.
The matter was next taken up on 03.12.2018 and when this Court taking note of the nature of
contest, directed the respondents to file a composite affidavit in CWJC No.15316 of 2017, dealing
with the claim advanced by the petitioners in the respective writ petitions towards the refund of
Excise Duty, licence fee as well as the VAT amount etc. The affidavits were to be filed separately by
the Excise Department and the Commercial Taxes Department on the respective refunds.
The matter was next taken up on 18.12.2018 and when learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners informed that while the dispute continues to subsist on the issue of refund of the VAT
amount as well as the Excise Duty amount, the Commercial Taxes Department had made refund of
the VAT amount as claimed by the petitioner in CWJC No.514 of 2018, however, the claim of the
said writ petitioner towards excise levy was yet pending.
We have heard Mr. Balbir Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 with the assistance of Mr. Satyabir Bharti and Mr. Aditya Patna High Court CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 Mukherji, Mr. Lalit Kishore learned Advocate General appearing

the Bihar State Beverages Corporation.

United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
We at this stage do not see the requirement of expressing ourselves on the merits of the claim save
and except that any objection by the respondents to make the refund of the advance deposits
towards the VAT and the levies under the repealed '1915 Act' and the rules framed thereunder, in
absence of any transaction done by the petitioners during the financial year 2016-17 (05.04.2016 to
31.03.2017), would be violative of the Constitutional guarantee reserved for the petitioners under
Article 265 of the Constitution of India which runs under:
"Article 265. Taxes not to be imposed save by authority of law.--No tax shall be levied
or collected except by authority of law."
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the records, we find that during
pendency of the writ applications the claims of the petitioners except that of the petitioners in CWJC
No.13165 of 2018 have been considered by the Commissioner of Excise, Government of Bihar
(respondent no.3) as well as the Principal Secretary and Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar
(respondent no.2). Certain payments Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 have
also been made to the petitioners by way of refunds of VAT, Form 19C licence fee, label registration
fee and excise duty. The petitioners have however highlighted that the respondents have failed to
refund some of the levies in its entirety. We propose to discuss the issues raised by the writ
petitioners, case-wise:
In this writ application, while questioning the order dated 16.08.2017 of the Deputy
Commissioner, Excise, the petitioner claimed refund of VAT and Excise Duty for the
financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17 as existing on date of filing of the writ petition, as
detailed in the rejoinder filed on 01.12.2018 and runs under:-
Particulars Amount Refundable (INR) Payment in the form of Advance Excise Duty
21,17,762.65 (i.e. the amount reflecting in the PLA Account maintained by the
petitioner) VAT paid on stocks, which were lying with the 10,80,99,581.40
Respondent no.4 or the petitioner on
31.03.2017 ("VAT") Excise Duty paid on stocks lying with the 6,73,61,950.69 Respondent no.4 or the
Petitioner as on 31.03.2017 ("Excise Duty") Fees paid towards the renewal of the 48,97,355.68
Petitioner's labels, bottling license fees and the 19-C license fees for the financial year 2016- 17
("Renewal Fees") During the intervening period, the respondent no.2, Principal Secretary cum
Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, quantified the refund at Rs.7,36,06,367/- vide order dated Patna
High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 08.09.2018 which has been refunded to the
petitioner by way of a demand draft of Rs.66270819.32 and sum of Rs.7335548 by way of
adjustment. The demand draft has been handed over to the representative of the petitioner on
22.10.2018. Similarly, the respondent no.3, Commissioner, Excise has also given certain refunds to
the petitioner details of which is available in the supplementary counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018
of respondent no.3 as under:-

Out of total refundable outstanding amount of Rs.32,61,762/-, the petitioner has

29.08.2018 for rest amount of Rs.41,782/- has been submitted to the Treasury
Mokama and the same will be soon paid. Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017
dt.30-04-2019 The grievance of the petitioner is now with respect to the following
levies:-
(I) Surcharge on VAT deposited @ 20% for the stocks lying with the petitioner or the
respondent no.4 as on 31.03.2017 to the tune of Rs.1,79,00,432/-:
To substantiate his claim it is the submission of the petitioner that under the
provisions of Section 3A of the Bihar VAT Act, 2005 every dealer liable to pay VAT
under the Bihar VAT Act is also required to pay a surcharge on the sale of goods
specified under Schedule IV of the Act. Thus, the incidence for deposit of surcharge
on VAT would only arise once "sale" of goods has been completed. It is the
submission of the petitioner that in the present case no 'sale' of goods has taken place
from the petitioner to the respondent no.4, therefore no question of surcharge on
VAT being levied, much less retained by the respondents would arise. It is contended
that the respondent no.
2 has failed to act in accordance with the orders of this Court and while he has
refunded a portion of the VAT paid by the petitioner on stocks with the
petitioner/respondent no.4 as on 31.03.2017, he has failed to refund the surcharge
paid by the petitioner on such stocks. It is submitted thus that the incidence for levy
of both the above i.e. VAT as well as surcharge on VAT Patna High Court CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 is the same and despite this the respondent no.2 has
illegally sought to retain the surcharge on VAT paid by the petitioner.

United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Consequently, it has been contended that any retention of surcharge paid by the petitioner is
without the authority of law.
(ii) VAT paid at the time of imposition of prohibition. It is the case of the petitioner that the
petitioner had paid VAT amounting to INR 70,01,112.95 on stocks which were in transit at the time
of imposition of prohibition in the State of Bihar. These stocks were returned by the respondent no.4
to the petitioner on or before 11.04.2016 ("Stock in Transit"). The said stock was supplied by the
petitioner to the respondent no.4 against valid order for supply issued by the respondent no.4 itself.
Given that such stock was returned by the respondent no.4 to the petitioner, it cannot be said that
'sale' of the stock had taken place. It is contended that that the incidence for the levy of VAT on such
stock did not arise. The respondent no.2 is therefore not correct in retaining the VAT paid by the
petitioner on such stocks and it is incumbent upon the respondent no.2 to refund the VAT.
According to the petitioner, it is difficult to understand the logic of respondent no.2 as he has
allowed the petitioner's claim for refund for the stocks that were in the possession of BSBCL, but has
not allowed the claim for the Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 stocks that
were in transit and could not at all be delivered to BSBCL. The respondent no.2, it is contended, has
failed to refund VAT paid on the stock in transit in arbitrary manner.
(iii) Refund of bottling and license fee deposited by the petitioner for the financial year 2015-16 to
the tune of Rs.34,79,930/-, carry forward Licence fee for 2015-16 of Rs.3,47,335/- and Bottling and
Licence fee for 2016-17 to the tune of Rs.15,00,000/-. In this regard, the petitioner has submitted
that in view of Rule 106(1)(B) of the 2012 Rules and the Bihar Excise Act, a bottling and license fee
of Rs.3 per LPL was payable on saleable stock of IMFL. Accordingly, the petitioner claims to have
deposited the prescribed bottling and license fee for the petitioner's brands suplied by it to the
respondent no.4 during the financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17. It is submitted that since the
respondents have destroyed the stocks of the petitioner, they are not entitled to retain the bottling
and license fee deposited for these goods. In this regard, the petitioner claims the following
outstanding refunds:-

petitioner has also claimed Bottling fee for the period of 2016-17 as manifest from the
rejoinder. It is one of the contentions of the petitioner that despite arriving at a
finding that an amount of INR 7,36,063,67.32 is refundable to the petitioner as VAT
refund for the stocks which were lying with the respondent no.4 or the petitioner as
on 31.03.2017, the respondent no.2 has only refunded an amount of INR
6,62,70,819.32 to the petitioner. The respondent no.2 has deducted an amount of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 12
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
INR 73,35, 548/- in terms of its assessment carried out on 26.06.2018. It is
contended that the adjustments made by the respondent no.2 is in violation of the
orders passed by this Court as the respondent no.2 was not at liberty to retain the
sum of INR 73,35,548/- and it was incumbent upon it to refund the entire amount of
INR 7,36,063,67.32.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 As regards the refund of Excise Duty to
the extent of claim of INR 6,73,61,950/- paid on stocks lying with the respondent no.4 and/or the
petitioner as on 31.03.2017, it is contended that despite the orders of this Court, the respondent no.3
has not refunded any portion of the said amount to the petitioner till date. In its order dated
06.08.2018 the respondent no.3 has stated that he has refunded the unutilized excise duty for the
financial year 2015-16 which according to the petitioner is misleading and incorrect.
The learned Advocate General representing the State of Bihar has in course of his argument relied
upon the reasonings and rationale provided in the order dated 08.09.2018 passed by the respondent
no.2, a copy of which has been brought on record as Annexure-A/1 to the supplementary counter
affidavit dated 07.12.2018 filed by the respondent no.2. It is submitted that in terms of sub-section
(2) of Section 68 of the Bihar VAT Act, 2005, the outstanding tax liability of an assessee is required
to be adjusted out of the refunds, therefore in the present case since there was an outstanding of
Rs.73,35,548/- against the petitioner for the assessment year 2015-16 and 2016-17, while processing
the refund, the said amount has been adjusted in accordance with the norms.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 As regards the claim of the petitioner on
account of surcharge on VAT deposited @20% for the stocks lying with the petitioner or the
respondent no.4 as on 31.03.2017, the learned Advocate General could not demonstrate as to why
the petitioner should be deprived of the said claims. The order dated 08.09.2018 passed by the
respondent no.2 is totally silent on this claim of the petitioner.
Again with regard to the claim of the petitioner on account of VAT paid on stock in transit there is
neither any consideration given by the respondent no.2 nor the learned Advocate General could
explain as to why the said claim of the petitioner is not paid.
As regards the claim on account of excise duty paid on stocks lying with the respondent no.4 or the
petitioner as on 31.03.2017, bottling and license fee paid for the financial year 2016-17, carry
forward bottling and license fee for the financial year 2015-16 and bottling and license fee for the
financial year 2015-16, the learned Advocate General has relied on the order dated 06.08.2018
passed by the Excise Commissioner, Bihar as contained in Annexure-P to the supplementary
counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018 filed on behalf of the respondent no.3. The Patna High Court
CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 relevant part of the order passed by the respondent no.3
reads as under:-
"Therefore the Prohibition and Excise Department provided ample opportunity to the
manufacturers of IMFL/BEER to export the finished goods and raw materials outside
the State of Bihar. Some of the manufacturers availed the opportunity thus provided

and taken stocks back from the BSBCL Godowns and 19C and raw materials and get
it exported outside the State of Bihar. The details of the stocks taken back by the
manufacturers can be ascertained from table.
Therefore, the stocks of IMFL that was not taken back from BSBCL Godowns as well
as the stocks which were not exported from 19C and 19B till 31.07.2017 were
destroyed in the light of the various orders passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in I.A.
Nos.61-75 of 2017 in S.L.P.© No.29749 of 2016. Moreover Section 23 of the Bihar
Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 does not allow claim for damages. Further the
petitioner companies does not suffer any loss on stocks of IMFL or raw materials
which were exported outside the State of Bihar so nothing remains to be refundable
on such exported stocks of IMFL.
It has been brought to the notice by Assistant Commissioner of Excise, Patna that
United spirits limited, Chitwan Blenders and Bottlers Pvt. Ltd., Colona Blenders and
Bottlers Ltd., Anusuya Blenders and Bottlers Pvt. Ltd. And Bacardi India Pvt. Ltd.
have duly submitted the utilization certificate and have already been paid the
outstanding unutilized excise duty of financial year 2015-16. However, despite several
reminders Saibya Liquors Pvt. Ltd., Sitamarhi is not providing the utilization
certificate for refund of outstanding unutilized Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of
2017 dt.30-04-2019 excise duty of financial year 2015-16. The Saibya Liquor Pvt. Ltd.
is hereby directed to submit the Register of Excise Duty of Financial Year 2015-16 to
the Excise Superintendent, Sitamarhi for calculation and verification of Excise Duty.
On such calculation if any outstanding unutilized Excise duty remains, the Excise
Superintendent, Sitamarhi is hereby directed to pay the same within 15 days. Saibya
Liquor Pvt. Ltd. will submit utilization certificate of excise duty of financial year
2015- 16 to the Excise Department, Sitamarhi and on such submission the Excise
Superintendent, Sitamarhi will refund such Excise duty, if any, within 15 days. The
demand related to VAT Duty is within the purview of Commercial Tax Department,
so the Petitioners can make the representation before the Commercial Tax
Department for the redressal of their grievances related to VAT Duty.
For the aforesaid reasons, the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, Patna is directed to
refund Aunsuya Blenders & bottlers pvt. Ltd. Rupees 98,369.00; to Chitwan Blenders

United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 It is apparent from reading of the order
passed by respondent no.3 that it nowhere considers the claim of the petitioner towards refund of
excise duty paid on the stocks lying with the respondent no.4 or the petitioner as on 31.03.2017. The
view taken by the respondent no.3 that the Prohibition and Excise Department provided ample
opportunity to the manufacturers of IMFL/BEER to export the finished goods and raw materials
outside the State of Bihar and some of the manufacturers availed the opportunity thus provided and
taken stocks and raw materials back from the BSBCL Godowns and got them exported outside the
State of Bihar, cannot be a reason according to us to take a view that those manufacturers of
IMFL/BEER who could not export the finished goods or raw materials outside the State of Bihar
during given period would not be liable for refund of the excise duty paid on the stocks. This aspect
of the matter has again not been considered by the respondent no.3.
We are willing to agree with the contentions of the petitioner that claim of the petitioner to extent of
INR6,73,61,950/- for the refund of excise duty paid on stocks lying with the respondent no.4 and/or
the petitioner as on 31.03.2017 is required to be considered along with the other claims on account
of bottling and license fee which were deposited by the petitioner. Learned Patna High Court CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 counsel for the petitioner has rightly submitted that the bottling
and license fee would be payable on saleable stock of IMFL and since the respondents have
destroyed the stocks of the petitioner, they are not entitled to retain the bottling and license fee
deposited for these goods. The outstanding claims as shown above in the table on account of excise
duty, 19C fees and bottling fee for the financial year 2015-16 together with the carry forward licence
fee for the said period and the balance for the period 2016-17 are thus liable to be considered by the
respondent no.2.
In the light of the discussions made hereinabove, while we are not willing to interfere with the
adjustment of arrears out of the refund of VAT, we leave it open for the petitioner to challenge the
adjustment of refunds, in case, they succeed in challenging the assessment order. We are of the
considered opinion that the respondent no.2 is required to consider the claim of the petitioner on
account of surcharge on VAT and the VAT paid on stock in transit. Let these claims of the petitioner
be considered by the respondent no.2 and a reasoned order thereon be passed after opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner and the admitted amount be paid to the petitioner within a period of three
months from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order. Patna High Court CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 Similarly, we are of the view that the Excise Commissioner, Bihar
(respondent no.3) would be obliged to consider the claims of the petitioner on account of excise duty
paid on stocks lying with the respondent no.4 or the petitioner as on 31.03.2017 and which were not
or could not be exported during the available period. The respondent no.3 shall accordingly be also
obliged to consider the other claims of the petitioner on account of bottling and license fee for the
financial year 2015-16, carry forward bottling and license fee for the financial year 2015-16 and the
bottling and license fee for the financial year 2015-16 to the extent it has remained undecided. The
respondent no.3 shall thus consider all these claims and pass a reasoned order after opportunity of
hearing to the petitioner and refund the admitted amount within a period of three months from the
date of receipt/production of a copy of this order. A reasoned decision thereon shall be
communicated to the petitioner within the aforesaid period. It will be open for the petitioner to
make submissions and produce all relevant materials which may be required for consideration of its

United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
claim before the respondent nos.2 and 3 on a date and time to be fixed by the respective
respondents.
In consequence of the discussion above while the order of the Deputy Commissioner dated
16.08.2017 impugned in the Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 writ petition
is set aside, the order of the Excise Commissioner dated 06.08.2018 in Misc. Case No. 1 of 2018
stands modified to that extent.
In this case, the claims of the petitioner, the amount refunded and the amount currently outstanding
according to the petitioner are shown hereunder in the tabular chart:-

Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 of the Petitioner's brands
for the Financial years 2016- 17 9.50,000/- 9,36,986/- 10,13,014/-
In support of its claim it is the submission of the petitioner that the respondents are not entitled to
retain VAT deposited by the petitioner for the period financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17 because the
incidence for levy of the same has not arisen. It is submitted that by virtue of Section 3 of the Bihar
VAT Act, 2005, every dealer shall be liable to pay VAT on sale or purchase, made by him. Thus, the
incidence for payment of VAT in the present case is 'sale' of goods from the petitioner to respondent
no.4. It is submitted that in the present case no "sale" of the petitioner's brands has taken place. It is
one of the contentions of the petitioner that the manufacturers/suppliers of IMFL were only entitled
to trade in IMFL in the State of Bihar in terms of the Liquor Sourcing Policy prevalent in the State
(i.e. Liquor Sourcing Policy 2013-14). It is stated that in terms of the said policy,
manufacturers/suppliers of IMFL were required to enter into an agreement with BSBCL
(respondent no.4) for supplying IMFL. Under clause '6' of the said agreement it is provided that
payment for the liquor delivered would be made only after disposal of liquor in the manner
prescribed in the Liquor Sourcing Policy for the completion of purchase process. Accordingly, under
clause '16' Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 of the Liquor Sourcing Policy
for the financial year 2013-14 issued by the respondent no.4 it is provided that "The sale shall be
concluded only when the liquor is delivered to buyers by the Corporation".
Thus, the petitioner contends that the 'sale' was unequivocally understood to have consummated
only once liquor was delivered by the respondent no.4 to the buyers. In view of the fact that
prohibition was introduced in the State of Bihar on 05.04.2016, the question of any sale taking place
does not arise after that date. Accordingly, the question of levy and/or retention of VAT already
deposited by the petitioner on the petitioner's brands to the respondents does not arise. It is
contended that, in its supplementary counter affidavit dated 09.08.2018 filed by the respondent
no.2 in CWJC No.15316 of 2017, he has placed on record a refund assessment order for the financial
year 2015-16 and 2016-17 pertaining to the refund claim of VAT made by the petitioner. The
respondent no.2 has unequivocally stated that it is liable to refund the VAT deposited by the
petitioner for the stocks which had destroyed as no sale has occurred. It is contended thus that in
view thereof, it is the undisputed position of the respondents that the State is not entitled to retain
'VAT' on the stocks which were unsold as on 31.03.2016. Another submission Patna High Court
CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 of the petitioner is with regard to erroneous deductions
made by the respondent no.2 from the VAT refundable to the petitioner. It is submitted that the
claim for refund made by the petitioner was in fact for a sum of INR 87,83,295/-. In support of its
claim, the petitioner had submitted several representations before the respondent no.2. Despite
that, the respondent no.2 has erroneously directed a refund only to the tune of INR 74,20,015.07.
There is a shortfall of INR 13,63,280.67 of VAT payable to the petitioner on stocks which were lying
with respondent no.4 as on 31.03.2017. It is contended that, while passing the VAT refund order, the
respondent no.2 has failed to appreciate that the value of stocks i.e. INR 87,83,295.74 has been
arrived at by the petitioner from the details available on the website of the respondent no.4 itself.
It is another ground of the petitioner that the respondents are not entitled to retain excise duties
deposited by the petitioner's brands, the incidence for deposit of which has not arisen in the first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 17
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
place. Referring to Section 27 and 28 of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 it is contended that
the excise duty is payable on the import, export, transport or manufacture of the petitioner's brands.
It is stated that the petitioner manufactured IMFL in Kashipur, Uttarakhand and Nanjangud,
Karnataka and exported the same to the State of Bihar for sale therein. It is Patna High Court CWJC
No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 submitted that when goods are imported into the State of Bihar for
sale, the State can only levy excise duty on such goods once the goods are "issued for sale".
Accordingly, it is submitted that there is a direct link between the levy of excise duty and the sale
that is to take place. In the present case, since the stocks of the petitioner have been destroyed, there
is no question of any sale taking place. Thus, it is the case of the petitioner that the State of Bihar is
not entitled to retain the excise duty deposited by the petitioner on the stocks which were destroyed
by it. Even otherwise, it is contended that underlying principle is that in case of export or import of
liquor, excise duty is payable only in the case of and at the place of sale and/or consumption.
As regards the reliance placed by the respondents on the provision of Section 23 of the Bihar
Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 in order to reject the claim of the petitioner for refund, it is
contended that the same is erroneous and misplaced inasmuch as Section 23 bars a party from
claiming damages or otherwise in consequence of any refusal to renew a license or permit. It is
submitted that the respondents have failed to appreciate that the petitioner was looking for refund
of taxes and duties from them which cannot be retained by the respondents without the authority of
law. It is the submission of the petitioner that Section 23 has no Patna High Court CWJC No.15316
of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 application in the facts of the present case and in case Section 23 is read to
empower the State Government to retain taxes and duties without the authority of law, the same will
render it ultra vires to the provisions of Article 265 of the Constitution of India.
On similar grounds as have been pleaded in CWJC No.15316 of 2017, the petitioner in this case has
also contended that the respondents have erred inasmuch as they have failed to refund the bottling
and license fees deposited by the petitioner for the financial year 2015-16 and they have also failed
to refund the fees deposited by the petitioner for the renewal of labels of the petitioner's brands.
It is submitted that the State of Bihar had on 18.04.2016 taken a policy decision to the effect that the
license holders such as the petitioner who had deposited interim VAT, license fee and excise duty
which had not been utilized and further the license fee and label registration fees deposited by the
petitioner license holders for the year 2016-17, would be refunded on porportionate basis. It is
submitted that the respondents have acted in complete derogation of their own previous policy
decisions and has failed to refund the claims of the petitioner on these counts.
Learned Advocate General representing the State of Bihar could not take any significant stand on
the submissions of Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 the petitioner. We also
find from the order dated 11.09.2018 passed by the Deputy Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, a
copy of which is available with the supplementary counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018 filed on behalf
of the respondent no.2 that save and except the claim for refund of the VAT to the extent of
Rs.8783295.74 on account of unsold stocks, no other claim of the petitioner has been considered
either by the Deputy Commissioner, Commercial Taxes or the respondent no.2. In the
supplementary counter affidavit filed in CWJC No.15316 of 2017, an order of the Joint
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 18
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
Commissioner, Commercial Taxes dated 08.09.2018 has been produced on record. In yet another
supplementary counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018 sworn by the Additional Commissioner, Sales Tax
by way of a tabular chart only the amount quantified by the competent authority and the refund
made has been shown.
We find from the records that no consideration whatsoever has been given to the various claims of
the petitioner either by the respondent no.2, Principal Secretary cum Commissioner, Commercial
Taxes or the respondent no.3, the Commissioner of Excise. The respondent no.3 has passed a
common order dated 06.08.2018 in Misc. Appeal Case No.01 of 2018 in the light of the direction of
this Court issued on 19.07.2018 while hearing these writ applications. The said Patna High Court
CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 common order takes note of CWJC No.15316 of 2017 and
CWJC No.16716 of 2016, but in the body of the order the deposits made by the petitioner during the
financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17 on account of 19C, label registration and excise duty have also
been shown. There is however no consideration or reasons provided in the order for and against the
claims of the petitioner.
The learned Advocate General is unable to explain the reasons for reducing the quantum of
refundable amount to the petitioner against the claims on different heads for the financial year
2016-17. No reason has been assigned for not taking a decision with respect to the refund of the
petitioner for the financial year 2015-16 particularly when in respect of some other petitioners the
decision was taken to refund certain portion of excise duty for the period 2015-16.
In the facts and circumstances as stated above, we find that the respondent authorities have
completely failed to provide any reasons for non-consideration of the claims of the petitioner for the
financial year 2015-16 as also reasons for reduced payment for the period 2016-17. We, therefore
direct the respondent nos.2, i.e. the Principal Secretary cum Commissioner, Commercial Taxes and
respondent no.3, the Excise Commissioner to take a decision and pass a reasoned order on the
respective claims of the petitioner Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 towards
refund of VAT and duties/levy/fee under the '1915 Act' and rules framed thereunder and ensure
payment of admitted amount to the petitioner within a period of 3 months from the date of
receipt/production of a copy of this order.
The respondent(s) Principal Secretary cum Commissioner, Commercial Taxes and the
Commissioner, Excise shall give an adequate opportunity of hearing to the petitioner to support the
respective claims, the concerned respondent(s) shall be obliged to consider each of the claim,
headwise and dispose of the same with reasons, for and against the claims, as the case may be. The
amounts found admissible be paid within the same period.
There are altogether five petitioners in this writ application. The four petitioners in the present case
were engaged in manufacture and sale of the brand owned by the respondent no.5. The claims of the
four petitioners towards outstanding dues of VAT, amount refunded and pending refund as claimed
by the petitioner nos.1 to 4 are provided hereunder in tabular chart:-

Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 To make grounds for the
aforesaid claims, these petitioners have also raised similar grounds and arguments
which have been taken note of by this Court hereinabove while dealing with the
aforesaid two writ applications.
On going through the records, we find that a supplementary counter affidavit dated
07.12.2018 has been filed on behalf of the respondent no.2 i.e. the Principal Secretary
cum Commissioner, Commercial Taxes. It is stated therein that in compliance of the
order dated 19.07.2018/31.07.2018, the competent authorities of the Commercial Tax
Department passed the necessary orders quantifying the amount of refund to the
petitioner subject to assessment. The amount quantified to be paid to the petitioner
vide order dated 08.08.2018 for period 2015-16 was Rs.3,43,77,707.25. Thereafter in
requisite Form C-V, the refund order for adjustment assessed dues amount of
Rs.2,40,47,746.00 for period 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2013-14 was passed on
28.08.2018. Accordingly, banker's cheque for Rs.10329961.00 (Rupees one crore
three lakh twenty nine thousand nine hundred sixty one only) was prepared. In this
manner, the total amount of Rs.3,43,77,707.25 was refunded to the petitioner no.1 by
way of banker's cheque and three treasury chalan as contained in Annexure-1 series.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 As regards the petitioner
no.2, it is stated that for the period 2015-16, the amount quantified for refund to the
petitioner was Rs.4,69,78,213.47 and the payment was made vide demand draft dated
15.09.2018 as contained in Annexure-B1 series.
The petitioner no.3 is said to have been found entitled for refund of Rs.114.06 which
has been paid to him vide CTMIS report as contained in Annexure-C1 series.
Petitioner no. 4 Saibya Liquors Private Ltd. was found entitled for refund of
Rs.97,49,532.55 for the period 2015-16 and the quantified amount has already been
paid.
In response to the supplementary counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018 of the
respondent no.2 the petitioners have filed a rejoinder in which it is stated that so far
as the claim for refund of VAT paid in advance on manufacture and supply of IMFL
to BSBCL which were either destroyed or exported to other States, the respondent
VAT authorities though initially rejected the claim for refund on VAT but passed an
order directing refund of VAT to the petitioners. It is contended that while passing
the order for refund of VAT on stock which had been destroyed or had been exported
to other States, the figures provided by BSBCL was only taken into consideration
resulting in shortfall in refund of VAT to the petitioners on account of the fact that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 22
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
the BSBCL figures did Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 not
take into account stocks returned to the factory by BSBCL which had been destroyed
or had been exported to other States on which VAT was paid in advance. It is
submitted that the respondent VAT authorities are required to refund VAT on the
stocks returned by BSBCL, which subsequently was either destroyed or exported to
other States. It is submitted that the respondent Commercial Tax Department is
liable to refund VAT paid in advance on such stocks.
Regarding the refund of excise levies also it is contended that the respondents have not refunded the
excise duty, bottling fee and distributor's licence fee deposited on manufacture, bottling and issue of
IMFL to BSBCL during the year 2015-16 or kept at the factory or were in transit to BSBCL which had
to be destroyed and drained out or had been exported on account of prohibition having been
imposed in the State of Bihar. The claims of the petitioners on these counts have been taken note of
hereinabove in the tabular chart, hence those are not required to repeat hereunder for repetition.
In this case also, we find that no plausible reason has been provided in the supplementary counter
affidavit filed on behalf of the State respondents to pay the reduced claim to the petitioners. No
reason at all has been assigned for non-payment of most of the claims. In course of argument also
no material could Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 be brought before us by
the learned Advocate General to demonstrate that any consideration has been given to the claims of
the petitioners with reasonings and rationale.
In the circumstances, we issue similar direction to the respondent nos.2 and 3 i.e. the Principal
Secretary cum Commissioner, Commercial Taxes and the Commissioner, Excise respectively as have
been issued by us in preceding writ applications in CWJC Nos.15316 of 2017 and 13165 of 2018 to
consider and dispose of the balance claims by a speaking order after opportunity of hearing within 3
months of receipt/production of a copy of this order. It goes without saying that the amounts found
admissible be paid within the same period.
In consequence, the order of the Deputy Cm missioner, Excise dated 16.08.2017 is set aside and the
order of the Excise Commissioner dated 06.08.2018 passed in Misc. Case No.1 of 2018 is modified
to that extent.
In the present case, the petitioner has raised the following claims:-
2015-16 Particulars Amount (Rs.) Excise duty deposited on stocks lying at BSBCL
and Rs.2,57,41,609.40 19C warehouse, which has been drained out Bottling fee lying
at BSBCL and 19C warehouse, Rs.18,08,803,43 which has been drained out Patna
High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 Distributor's License Fee lying at
BSBCL and 19C Rs.35,02,876.65 warehouse, which has been drained out.

Total 23,82,452.00 48,99,766.00
As against the aforesaid claims of the petitioner the respondent nos.1, 3 and 5 have
taken a stand that earlier the claim of the petitioner was found not acceptable in
terms of the provisions made under Section 23 of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise
Act, 2016 and accordingly an order dated 16.08.2017 was issued which came to be
challenged in the present writ application.
A copy of the order dated 16.08.2017 is available at Annexure-19 to the writ
application. It is submitted that after receipt of the writ application matter was again
examined by the Department and vide letter no.710 dated 28.02.2018 the Assistant
Commissioner of Excise of the concerned District of Patna was directed to take Patna
High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 necessary steps to refund the
excise duty bottling fee and license fee proportionately in accordance with resolution
dated 18.04.2016. It was submitted that the answering respondents were taking
sincere steps towards finalizing the claim of refund of the petitioner.
A statement has been made in paragraph 16 of the supplementary counter affidavit dated 9.8.2018
that the petitioner would be required to appear before the competent authority with relevant papers
in support of its claim for refund as the department has not denied to refund the excise duty to the
petitioner which are due and payable to them as per rules. In the same counter affidavit, however
these respondents have stated that manufacturing and bottling of IMFL/BEER were not prohibited
from 05.04.2016 within the State of Bihar. The State government vide notification no.819 dated
06.10.2016 decided to give hundred percent tax holiday on export duty and bottling fees on
production of IMFL and BEER within the State of Bihar. It is stated that in tune with the aforesaid
policy decision, the State government vide notification no.911 dated 19.10.2016 allowed to continue
the production at existing licenses of breweries and bottling in the State of Bihar. The companies
enjoyed the privileges granted by the Excise Department in financial year 2015-16 without any Patna
High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 hindrance and they were provided the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 24
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
opportunity to produce and export IMFL/BEER outside the State of Bihar in financial year 2016-17.
Thus, it is contended that question of refund for financial year 2015-16 with respect to Form 19C
licence fees, excise duty and label registration fees which have been utilized, does not arise.
It is further contended that the State government vide notification no.60 dated 24.01.2017 had
taken a policy decision not to renew the existing licenses of IMFL manufacturing, bottling plants,
brewery and bottling plants of brewery from financial year 2017-18, therefore, the State government
provided ample opportunity to the companies for production and export the same outside the State
of Bihar till 31.03.2017.
It is further submitted that the petitioner has duly submitted the utilization certificate and have
already been paid the outstanding unutilized excise duty of financial year 2015-16 at the tune of
Rs.1,07,95,327. Further the unutilized Form 19C licence fees of 2015-16 and advance of 2016-17
which cumulatively stands at Rupees 24,09,852/- have also been paid to the petitioner. The advance
with respect to Label Registration Fee of financial year 2016-17 has also been refunded with
deduction of Rs.4110, calculating the same for 5 days. However, vide memo no.2751 dated
08.08.2018 the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, Patna has Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of
2017 dt.30-04-2019 been directed to refund the remaining Rs.4110 with respect to label registration
fees and therefore nothing reamins to be refunded back to the petitioner.
The respondent no.2 in his supplementary counter affidavit dated 07.12.2018 has stated that the
competent authorities of the Commercial Taxes Department has passed the necessary orders
quantifying the amount of refund to the petitioner under the Bihar VAT Act, 2005 and the
quantified amount of Rs.32382882.00 has already been refunded to the petitioner vide
Annexure-A-1 and A-2 to the said affidavit.
We have taken note of the submissions of the respondent nos.1, 3 and 5 in their supplementary
counter affidavit dated 09.08.2018. We find that while at the first instance they passed the
impugned order dated 16.08.2017 rejecting the claim of the petitioner in terms of Section 23 of the
Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, subsequently they themselves considered the claim for
refund, therefore, in our opinion the impugned order dated 16.08.2017 has been rendered
redundant by the own act of the respondents. The impugned order dated 16.08.2017 as thus lost its
significance and no adjudcation is required with respect to the legality and validity of the said
impugned order. Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 We also find that on the
one hand the respondent nos.1, 3 and 5 in their own supplementary counter affidavit took a plea in
paragraph 16 that they are taking sincere steps for finalizing the claim of refund of the petitioner and
for that the petitioner would be required to appear before the competent authority with relevant
papers in support of their claims of refund, but subsequently in paragraph 20 of the supplementary
counter affidavit the respondents went on to take a plea that question of refund for financial year
2015-16 with respect to 19C fees, excise duty and label registration fees which according to them
have been utilized by the petitioner, does not arise. Certain reasons have been assigned for this
purpose by the respondents in the affidavit but we are unable to accept those reasons and the plea of
the respondents for the solitary reason that the respondents seem to have acted in haste in making
statements in the affidavit without giving appropriate consideration to the claim of the petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158752088/ 25
United Spirits Limited vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 30 April, 2019
after giving him an opportunity to appear and produce relevant papers in support of his claim of
refund.
We find from the rejoinder filed by the petitioner that he has supported his claims towards excise
duty, bottling fee and distributor's licence fees realized from the petitioner on manufacture, bottling
and issue of beer from its warehouse during Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017
dt.30-04-2019 the year 2015-16. It is the contention of the petitioner that although he manufactured
and supplied it to the BSBCL but those were in transit or stored at the brewery and had to be
ultimately destroyed and drained out, therefore, the petitioner would be entitled to get a refund
inasmuch as the transaction of sale was not complete.
We also find from the order dated 06.08.2018, a copy of which has been brought on record by way
of Annexure-D to the supplementary counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent nos.1, 3 and
5 that it nowhere records that prior to passing of the order as contained in Annexure- 'D', any
opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner. In our considered opinion since the order as
contained in Annexure- 'D' is said to have been passed in compliance of the order of this Court
issued on 19.07.2018 in the present writ application, this Court not being satisfied with the order as
contained in Annexure-D would in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India set aside the order dated 06.08.2018 in so far as it relates to the rejection of the claims of the
petitioner under the '1915 Act' and the rules framed thereunder for refunds pertaining to the
financial year 2015-16 and 2016-17 including those with respect to Form 19C licence fees, bottling
fees, excise duty and label registration fee and while setting aside the order dated 06.08.2018 we
would once again Patna High Court CWJC No.15316 of 2017 dt.30-04-2019 direct the Excise
Commissioner, Bihar (respondent no.3) to consider the claims of the petitioner afresh after giving
the petitioner an adequate opportunity of hearing including opportunity to produce all such
materials which the petitioner can produce in support of its claims. The respondent no.3 shall
thereupon pass a reasoned order by giving consideration to the submissions of the petitioner as
regards each of the claim and shall complete the whole exercise including payment of admitted
amount to the petitioner within a period of 3 months from the date of receipt/production of a copy
of this order.
All the writ applications are allowed in terms stated hereinabove.
