ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 13-10-2025
Heard learned Advocate for the respective parties.
2. The petitioner was duly appointed as a clerk on
26.08.1988
at Primary Teachers Training College, Rampur Jajalpur, Dalsingsarai, District Samastipur. Having
discharged his duty to the satisfaction of the authorities concerned, finally superannuated from the
service on 31.01.2022 on the same post from the District Institute of Education and Training (in
short Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 'DIET'), Darbhanga. After having
extended the benefit of ACP/MACP upon completion of 10, 20 and 30 years of service, when the
petitioner came to be superannuated and sanctioned all the retiral benefits in his favour, the

Sushil Kumar Pathak vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
respondent authorities have come out with letter no. 1050 dated 25.08.2023 and letter no. 1104
dated 05.09.2023 issued under the signature of respondent no.9, as also the consequential letter no.
359 dated 18.09.2023 issued under the signature of respondent no.7 whereby the petitioner has
been directed to deposit a total sum of Rs.4,32,896/- in Darbhanga Treasury or in alternative to give
consent letter to allow the respondents to recover the same from the payable gratuity amount of the
petitioner. Aggrieved with the aforesaid order, the petitioner has preferred the present writ petition.
3. Besides the submission that the petitioner was superannuated from the post of clerk and now any
recovery from a retired employee is impermissible in view of the mandate of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Rafiq Masih (While Washer) [(2015) 4 SCC 334], it is
submitted that identically situated persons, who were also superannuated from the post of Clerk in
different offices, they had been allowed identical benefits/pay scale and no order of Patna High
Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 recovery has been passed, the particulars of which have
duly been disclosed in para.13, but discrimination has been caused and the order for recovery has
been passed, in case of the petitioner, as aforenoted. It is not the case of the respondent authorities
that the petitioner has played any fraud and misrepresentation at the time of fixation of pay scale or
while extending the benefit of ACP/MACP.
4. The petitioner has been allowed 1st and 2nd ACP on 30.09.2016 and 3rd MACP on 30.08.2018.
At no point of time, before superannuation of the petitioner, the petitioner has been subjected to any
proceeding or even after his superannuation under Section 139 and 43(b) of the Bihar Pension
Rules. The recovery from the retiral benefits without there being any statutory rules is also said to be
bad in the eye of law that too from the retired employees, is the contention of the learned Advocate
for the petitioner.
5. Learned Advocate for the Accountant General, Bihar submitted that the Principal DIET,
Kaligahat, Darbhanga vide his letter no. 379 dated 03.10.2023 has sent the service book along with
papers for issuing pension authority. On scrutiny, it was found that pensionery benefit has been
authorized as per the last pay entitlement in the service book, Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of
2024 dt.13-10-2025 which has been intimated vide its No. Pen05/23-24/1407-08 dated 04.12.2023.
Based upon the aforesaid sanction order, the payment has been made. It is further submitted that so
far the recovery to be done due to excess payment of salary, the same is for the department.
6. A counter affidavit has also been filed on behalf of State respondents and it is submitted that since
at the time of fixation of retiral benefit, an objection has been raised by the office of the Accountant
General with a remark that the petitioner has been paid excess to his entitlement on account of
wrong fixation of the salary from 30.09.2016 to 31.01.2022, hence fresh calculation has been made.
On being found the petitioner has been made excess payment, the impugned letter has been issued
to deduct the amount of Rs.4,32,895/-. So far the contention of the petitioner raising plea of
discrimination, it is submitted that since no such objection has been raised with regard to other
identically situated persons, therefore, till date no decision has been taken. However, in case of the
petitioner, objection has been raised by the office of Accountant General, hence verification was
made and once it is found that the petitioner has been paid excess to his entitlement, the order of
recovery has been passed.

Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025
7. Learned Advocate for the State referring to Annexure-P/2 submitted that while extending the
benefit of 3 rd MACP, it was made clear that in case, in future, it shall be found that the petitioner is
not entitled to get such benefit or any excess amount has been paid, the same shall be recovered
from the employee concerned. The petitioner was also directed to submit a bond in this regard.
8. Before parting with the present writ petition, it would be relevant to take note of the decision
rendered by the Apex court in the case of Rafiq Masih (supra), the Court succinctly held that it is not
possible to postulate all situations of hardship which would govern the employees on the issue of
recovery, where payments have mistakenly been made by the employer, in excess of their
entitlement. Based on the decisions rendered by the Apex Court in earlier cases, the Hon'ble Court
summarized the following situations, whereas recovery by the employer would be held
impermissible in law.
""18. It is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship which would govern
employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have mistakenly been made by
the employer, in excess of their entitlement. Be that as it may, based on the decisions
referred to hereinabove we may, as a ready reference, summarize the following few
situations, wherein recoveries by the Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024
dt.13-10-2025 employers, would be impermissible in law:-
(i) Recovery from the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV service (or Group
C and Group D service).
(ii) Recovery from the retired employees, or the employees who are due to retire
within one year, of the order of recovery.
(iii) Recovery from the employees, when the excess payment has been made for a
period in excess of five years, before the order of recovery is issued.
(iv) Recovery in cases where an employee has wrongfully been required to discharge
duties of a higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even though he should have
rightfully been required to work against an inferior post.
(v)In any other case, where the court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made
from the employee, would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as
would far outweigh the equitable balance of the employer's right to recover".
"(A) If it is from employees belonging from Class III and Class IV services (or Group
C and Group D service);
(B) If it is from retired employees or the employees who are due to retire within one
year, of the order of recovery; (C) If it is from the employees, when the excess

Sushil Kumar Pathak vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
payment has been made for a period in excess of five years before the order of
recovery is issued;
Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 (D) From employees who were wrongfully
made to discharge duties of higher post and have been paid accordingly even though they should
have rightfully been required to work against an inferior post."
9. Admittedly, in the case in hand, the question and the dispute as to whether the amount was paid
in excess to the entitlement to the petitioner or could not be adjusted by the erstwhile employee, but
it is obvious that the order has been issued to recover the same from the pension of the employee,
that too, without following any due process of law.
10. In the case of Rafiq Masih (supra), the Court while summarizing the situation where the recovery
by the employer from the employees belonging to Class-III and Class- IV service would be made
impermissible, it has further claimed made clear in para-18(v) of the said judgment that in any other
case, where the court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made from the employee, would be
iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as would far outweigh the equitable balance of the
employer's right to recover.
11. The decision afore noted has been passed after reiterating the decision passed by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in catena of decisions reported in Syed Abdul Qadir & Ors. vs State Of Bihar & Ors.
[(2009) 3 SCC 475]; Sahib Ram vs. Patna High Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 State of
Haryana [(1995) Suppl.1 SCC 18]; Shyam Babu Verma vs. Union of India [(1994) 2 SCC 521]; V.
Ganga Ram vs. Regional Joint Director & Ors.[(1997) 6 SCC 139]; Purshottam Lal Das vs. State of
Bihar [(2006) 11 SCC 492]; Bihar State Electricity Board vs. Bijay Bhadur [(2000) 10 SCC 99]; B.J.
Akkara vs. Government of India & Ors. [(2006) 11 SCC 709].
12. In the aforenoted settled position, now coming to the facts of the case. Even as per the stand of
the State, it is admittedly the petitioner is said to have been paid excess to his entitlement from
30.09.2016 and the petitioner superannuated on 31.01.2022, but till date of his retirement, no
action has been taken with regard to any wrongful fixation of the salary of the petitioner. It is not the
case of the respondent State and the Accountant General that there is misrepresentation on the part
of the petitioner, rather salary of the petitioner was fixed by the authorities of the State Government
and the petitioner was holding class-III post, hence in any view of the matter he was not in a
position to influence the decision of the authorities.
13. So far the submission of the State to the extent that an undertaking was taken from the
petitioner, no such bond has been produced, as executed by the petitioner in the counter Patna High
Court CWJC No.1102 of 2024 dt.13-10-2025 affidavit.
14. The submission of the petitioner with respect to other identically situated persons, who have
been allowed identical pay scale, like the petitioner, but they have been left untouched and no action
has been taken, has also not been properly answered by the concerned respondent; only submission
has been made that since objection was raised by the Accountant General, Bihar, only with respect

Sushil Kumar Pathak vs The State Of Bihar on 13 October, 2025
to petitioner, order of recovery has been passed. So far other is concerned, since no objection has
been raised, therefore, the Department has not proceeded against them. This action of the
respondents also finds actuated with discrimination.
15. In view of the aforesaid discussions and the position of law, as discussed hereinabove, this Court
finds that the impugned orders are unsustainable and accordingly, order as contained in letter no.
1050 dated 25.08.2023 and letter no. 1104 dated 05.09.2023 issued under the signature of
respondent no.9, as also the consequential letter no. 359 dated 18.09.2023 are hereby set aside. The
authorities are directed to ensure payment of remaining pensionary/due amount preferably within a
period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.

16. The writ petition stands allowed.
