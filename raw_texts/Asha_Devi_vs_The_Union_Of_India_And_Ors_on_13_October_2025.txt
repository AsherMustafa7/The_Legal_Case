ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 13-10-2025
1. The petitioner has filed the Writ application for the following reliefs:
"For issuance of appropriate writ, order or direction to the Respondent No. 1 and 2,
directing them to make payment of monetary compensation to the petitioner for the
pecuniary loss and damage caused due to breach of public duty to be objective in
issuing Eligibility Certificate for allotment of LPG distributorship under defence
category and due to error committed by Respondent No. 2 in Patna High Court
CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 issuing wrong Eligibility Certificate, the
selection and grand of LPG distributorship to the petitioner has been set aside,
resulting into termination of the LPG distributorship of the Petitioner, which involves
pecuniary loss of several lakhs rupees to the Petitioner and also affected the source of
livelihood of the Petitioner."
2. This is the second round of litigation arising from the same cause. The petitioner is the widow of
Late Sepoy Vinod Kumar Singh, who died in 1988 while serving the Indian Army in Jammu &
Kashmir. In 2007, she applied for LPG distributorship under the defence quota. She was issued an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/104433532/ 1
Asha Devi vs The Union Of India And Ors on 13 October, 2025
Eligibility Certificate dated 14.11.2007 by the Directorate General Resettlement, Ministry of Defence
under Priority-II. Relying upon the said certificate, she applied for the LPG distributor at Raxaul by
Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) and was selected. A Letter of Intent (LOI) and Letter of
Appointment (LOA) were issued to her, and she commenced distributorship operations. The second
Patna High Court CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 empanelled candidate, Smt. Rani Devi,
challenged the petitioner's selection. Upon inquiry, the EME Records clarified that the petitioner's
husband's death, though attributable to military service, did not qualify as a battle casualty. Based
on this clarification, Directorate General Resettlement unilaterally downgraded the petitioner's
eligibility from Priority-II to Priority-IV. Even after the deduction of marks, due to the change in
priority, the petitioner retained the top position in the merit list. However, the Division Bench of
this Court in LPA No. 704 of 2010 set aside her selection on the ground that her application was
defective at inception, as it was based on an incorrect Eligibility Certificate. Her subsequent review
petition and Special Leave Petition before the Hon'ble Supreme Court were dismissed. IOCL then
terminated her distributorship.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner merely applied for an Eligibility
Certificate and did not seek any specific priority. The DGR, on its own assessment, Patna High Court
CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 issued the certificate under Priority-II. The petitioner acted
in good faith, relying upon an official document issued by a competent authority applied for LPG
distributorship. It is further submitted that the subsequent downgrading was done unilaterally
without affording any opportunity of hearing to the petitioner.
4. It is further submitted that the petitioner suffered financial loss of around Rs.10 lakhs due to
cancellation of dealership. The Directorate General Resettlement failed in its duty to verify facts and
act objectively before issuing the certificate, amounting to administrative negligence. Therefore, the
petitioner is entitled for monetary compensation to the loss caused.
5. In support of the submissions, the Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon a
judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in (i) United AIR Travel Services v. Union of India ( W.P. (C)
No. 631 of 2016 (ii) Chambara Soy v. State of Orissa & Ors. reported in AIR 2008 Orissa 148.
Patna High Court CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025
6. A counter affidavit was filed on behalf of the respondent No. 3 / IOCL.The Learned counsel for
the IOCL submitted that Indian Oil Corporation acted strictly on the basis of the Eligibility
Certificate issued by the DGR. The Letter of Intent and subsequent Letter of Allotment were issued
conditionally, subject to revision in priority by Directorate General Resettlement.
7. It is further submitted that in light of the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Division Bench's in LPA
No. 704/2010, IOCL terminated the dealership of the petitioner.
8. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties and of perusal of records, it appears that the
petitioner's application was entertained and the selection was made on the basis of an erroneous
certificate issued by Directorate General Resettlement under Priority-II. The Division Bench of this

Asha Devi vs The Union Of India And Ors on 13 October, 2025
Court, in LPA No. 704/2010, has already held that the application itself was defective since
inception, and thus the entire selection process stood vitiated. This view was affirmed by dismissal
Patna High Court CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 of the review petition and Special Leave
Petition by the Hon'ble Apex Court. The petitioner's claim for compensation is founded upon
administrative negligence by Directorate General Resettlement.
9. The prayer for issuance of a writ, directing payment of compensation on the basis of an alleged
administrative lapse cannot be acceded in the absence of clear proof of mala fide, gross negligence,
or breach of a statutory duty. In the present case, competent court of law has not held that the
Directorate General Resettlement has acted with malice negligence or inviolation of statutory
obligation. The petitioner's recourse, if any, lies in pursuing a civil suit for damages, where such
claims can be adjudicated upon evidence of negligence and actual loss.
10. This Court, while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India
cannot assess compensation claims that involves disputed facts.
11. In light of the above discussion, this Court finds no merit in the present writ petition.
Patna High Court CWJC No.20348 of 2018 dt.13-10-2025 The prayer for monetary compensation is
not maintainable in the exercise of writ jurisdiction, particularly in light of the fact that the legality
of the distributorship in question is conclusively determined by earlier judicial pronouncements.
12. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed.
13. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
