JUDGMENT
This second appeal arises out of a suit for injunction which had been instituted by the appellants
against Bylappa. Both the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court have refused to grant the said
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 3
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
decree of injunction and hence the plaintiffs have presented this second appeal.
2. During the hearing of this appeal, the 2nd plaintiff sought to withdraw the suit in so far as he was
concerned and as desired by him, the suit of the 2nd plaintiff was dismissed.
3. For the purposes of clarity, in this judgment, the parties are referred to by their names instead of
their rankings.
4. It was the case of the plaintiffs i.e., Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah that the suit
property (an agricultural land measuring 3 acres 25 guntas bearing Sy.No.108 situate at
Mathadahalli village, Dasanapura Hobli, Nelamangala Taluk) belonged to one Arasaiah who had
gifted it to his sister Kalamma i.e., the mother of the 1st plaintiff, under a registered gift deed dated
15.09.1921. It was their case that during the lifetime of Kalamma, she had enjoyed possession of the
suit property along with her husband Muddaiah and after the death of Kalamma, the revenue
entries were changed in favour of the 1st plaintiff, Channaiah @ Doddachannaiah in 1935.
5. It was stated that Kalamma had two sons, Channaiah @ Doddachannaiah (1st plaintiff) and
Chikkachannaiah (father of the 2nd plaintiff). It was stated that on the death of Chikkachannaiah,
the 2nd plaintiff had succeeded to his share and hence, he was also a co-owner of the suit property.
It was contended that the record of rights and the Pahani right from the year 1968 up to 1989 stood
in the name of the Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah, thus, establishing that they were in
lawful possession. It was stated that they had paid the land revenue to the Government and the said
documents proved that they were in lawful possession. It was stated that Bylappa was trying to
interfere with their peaceful possession over the land bearing Sy.No.108 measuring 3 acres 25
guntas and hence, they were constrained to institute the suit.
6. Bylappa, the sole original defendant, entered appearance and denied the averments of the plaint.
He did not however dispute the relationship of the Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah.
He, however, set forth the specific plea that one Hanumantaiah had in all three children, i.e., two
sons, Arasappa and Obalaiah and one daughter Kalamma. He stated that he was the son of Arasappa
and his father's brother i.e., the second son of Hanumanthaiah, viz., Obalaiah, had no issues and
Arasappa was given to bad habits and he had driven away his wife, his son (Bylappa) and his brother
Obalaiah from the house and had knocked away all the properties. It was stated that Arasappa
started living with his sister Kalamma and also along with his concubine Nagamma.
7. It was categorically stated that Obalaiah had purchased the suit property from one Revanna under
a registered sale deed dated 01.09.1912 and on the death of Obalaiah, his brother Arasappa had
gifted the property to his sister Kalamma.
8. It was also stated that plaintiff No.1 had mortgaged the property in favour of Bylappa on
29.09.1936 under a registered mortgage deed and Bylappa was paying the taxes regularly every year
and had documents to establish that the property was in his possession.

Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
9. It was stated that the father of plaintiff No.2, Chikkachannaiah had instituted proceedings under
the Debt Relief Act and in those proceedings plaintiff No.1 had filed an affidavit before the Taluka
Magistrate stating that Bylappa was the owner in possession of the suit property and that he had no
subsisting interest in it and it was also stated therein that at the instigation of some persons,
Chikkachannaiah, the father of plaintiff No.2, had initiated the proceedings under the Debt Relief
Act. It was finally contended that there was no cause of action for the suit and the suit was liable to
dismissed.
10. The Trial Court on consideration of the evidence adduced before it, proceeded to conclude that
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah had failed to establish the title of Arasappa in order to
validate the gift that he had made in favour of Kalamma. The Trial Court stated that though a
registered gift deed had been executed by Arasappa in favour of Kalamma, the recitals of the gift
deed itself had stated that the property was standing in the name of Obalaiah who had purchased
the property under a sale deed dated 17.09.1906, and it had also been stated that the Khata was
standing in the name of Arasappa and that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah had failed
to establish as to how Arasappa acquired title so as to gift the property to Kalamma and therefore,
the gift could not be believed.
11. It also took the view that in the gift it had not been stated as to how and where the donee had
accepted the gift and as to when he had taken possession in accordance with the terms of the gift. It,
thus, concluded that the essential requirements of the gift, as prescribed in the law, had not been
established.
12. The Trial Court also observed that there was a discrepancy in the name of the 1st plaintiff in the
RTCs, inasmuch as in the Owner's column, it had been entered as Channaiah son of Muddaiah,
whereas in the cultivators' column, it had been shown as Doddachannaiah and this discrepancy in
the names, had not been explained. The Trial Court thus concluded that the RTCs could not be
relied upon to come to the conclusion that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah were in
possession. The Trial Court refused to accept the oral evidence and concluded that in the absence of
any documentary evidence, the oral evidence would not be of much consequence. The Trial Court
took the view that the documents produced by Bylappa proved that he was in possession and it
accordingly, proceeded to dismiss the suit.
13. Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah, being aggrieved, preferred an appeal.
14. In the appeal, the Appellate Court took the view that it was required to examine whether the
name of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah had been wrongfully entered in the revenue
records. It, thereafter, went on to observe that the revenue documents produced did not disclose on
what basis the name of plaintiff No.1 had been entered in the revenue records. It also took note of
the statement filed before the Tahasildar, by the father of the 2nd plaintiff vide Ex.D.7 and also the
affidavit filed by the 1st plaintiff vide Ex.D.8, to come to the conclusion that it was Bylappa who was
in possession of the suit property.

Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
15. The Appellate Court came to the conclusion that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah
were trying to take advantage of the revenue records standing in their names for two years and had
instituted the suit and they had not offered any explanation as to how the name of the 1st plaintiff
came to be entered into RTC. The Appellate Court also took the view the entry of Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah in the revenue records were rebuttable in nature and since there was
no explanation by Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah as to how the name of the 1st
plaintiff had been entered in the revenue records, the mere occurrence of the name in the revenue
records would not entitle them for a decree of injunction. The Appellate Court accordingly
confirmed the decree of the Trial Court and dismissed the appeal.
16. It is as against these concurring judgments, the present second appeal has been preferred.
17. This second appeal was admitted to consider the following substantial questions of law:
a) Whether the trial Court has grossly erred in recording the finding as regards to the
competency to execute Gift Deed by Arasaiah, which is beyond the scope and enquiry
of the suit for injunction?
b) Whether the cause of action of the plaintiffs as regards the relief of injunction
would continue subsequent to the death of Bylappa the original defendant and also in
the light of the sale to defendant No.6?
c) Whether the Courts below have committed any error in not taking note of Ex.P.24?
Regarding the 1st substantial question of law:
18. Before considering the rival contentions, it would be profitable to refer to the exposition of law
rendered by the Apex Court (which is relied upon by both sides) in the case of ANATHULA
SUDHAKAR VS P. BUCHI REDDY reported in [2008 (4) SCC 594]. In the said decision, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has laid down the following principles in relation to a suit for injunction:
"11. The general principles as to when a mere suit for permanent injunction will lie,
and when it is necessary to file a suit for declaration and/or possession with
injunction as a consequential relief, are well settled. We may refer to them briefly.
11.1) Where a plaintiff is in lawful or peaceful possession of a property and such
possession is interfered or threatened by the defendant, a suit for an injunction
simpliciter will lie. A person has a right to protect his possession against any person
who does not prove a better title by seeking a prohibitory injunction. But a person in
wrongful possession is not entitled to an injunction against the rightful owner.
11.2) Where the title of the plaintiff is not disputed, but he is not in possession, his
remedy is to file a suit for possession and seek in addition, if necessary, an injunction.
A person out of possession, cannot seek the relief of injunction simpliciter, without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 6
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
claiming the relief of possession.
11.3) Where the plaintiff is in possession, but his title to the property is in dispute, or
under a cloud, or where the defendant asserts title thereto and there is also a threat of
dispossession from defendant, the plaintiff will have to sue for declaration of title and
the consequential relief of injunction. Where the title of plaintiff is under a cloud or
in dispute and he is not in possession or not able to establish possession, necessarily
the plaintiff will have to file a suit for declaration, possession and injunction."
19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the said decision has thereafter summarised the legal position
regarding a suit for prohibitory injunction, in relation to the immoveable property and the same
reads as follows:
"21. To summarize, the position in regard to suits for prohibitory injunction relating
to immovable property, is as under:
(a) Where a cloud is raised over plaintiff's title and he does not have possession, a suit
for declaration and possession, with or without a consequential injunction, is the
remedy. Where the plaintiff's title is not in dispute or under a cloud, but he is out of
possession, he has to sue for possession with a consequential injunction. Where there
is merely an interference with plaintiff's lawful possession or threat of dispossession,
it is sufficient to sue for an injunction simpliciter.
(b) As a suit for injunction simpliciter is concerned only with possession, normally
the issue of title will not be directly and substantially in issue. The prayer for
injunction will be decided with reference to the finding on possession. But in cases
where de jure possession has to be established on the basis of title to the property, as
in the case of vacant sites, the issue of title may directly and substantially arise for
consideration, as without a finding thereon, it will not be possible to decide the issue
of possession.
(c) But a finding on title cannot be recorded in a suit for injunction, unless there are
necessary pleadings and appropriate issue regarding title [either specific, or implied
as noticed in Annaimuthu Thevar (supra)].
Where the averments regarding title are absent in a plaint and where there is no issue relating to
title, the court will not investigate or examine or render a finding on a question of title, in a suit for
injunction. Even where there are necessary pleadings and issue, if the matter involves complicated
questions of fact and law relating to title, the court will relegate the parties to the remedy by way of
comprehensive suit for declaration of title, instead of deciding the issue in a suit for mere injunction.
(d) Where there are necessary pleadings regarding title, and appropriate issue relating to title on
which parties lead evidence, if the matter involved is simple and straight-forward, the court may
decide upon the issue regarding title, even in a suit for injunction. But such cases, are the exception
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 7
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
to the normal rule that question of title will not be decided in suits for injunction. But persons
having clear title and possession suing for injunction, should not be driven to the costlier and more
cumbersome remedy of a suit for declaration, merely because some meddler vexatiously or
wrongfully makes a claim or tries to encroach upon his property. The court should use its discretion
carefully to identify cases where it will enquire into title and cases where it will refer to plaintiff to a
more comprehensive declaratory suit, depending upon the facts of the case."
20. Thus, as per the above ratio where a plaintiff is in lawful or peaceful possession of the property
and his possession is threatened, a suit for injunction simpliciter would lie. It is also clarified by the
Apex Court that a prayer for declaration would be necessary only if there is a cloud cast on the title
of the plaintiff. The Supreme Court has also further stated in paragraph 14, regarding the raising of a
cloud in respect of a person's title, as follows:
14. We may however clarify that a prayer for declaration will be necessary only if the
denial of title by the defendant or challenge to plaintiff's title raises a cloud on the
title of plaintiff to the property. A cloud is said to raise over a person's title, when
some apparent defect in his title to a property, or when some prima facie right of a
third party over it, is made out or shown. An action for declaration, is the remedy to
remove the cloud on the title to the property. On the other hand, where the plaintiff
has clear title supported by documents, if a trespasser without any claim to title or an
interloper without any apparent title, merely denies the plaintiff's title, it does not
amount to raising a cloud over the title of the plaintiff and it will not be necessary for
the plaintiff to sue for declaration and a suit for injunction may be sufficient. Where
the plaintiff, believing that defendant is only a trespasser or a wrongful claimant
without title, files a mere suit for injunction, and in such a suit, the defendant
discloses in his defence the details of the right or title claimed by him, which raises a
serious dispute or cloud over plaintiff's title, then there is a need for the plaintiff, to
amend the plaint and convert the suit into one for declaration. Alternatively, he may
withdraw the suit for bare injunction, with permission of the court to file a
comprehensive suit for declaration and injunction. He may file the suit for
declaration with consequential relief, even after the suit for injunction is dismissed,
where the suit raised only the issue of possession and not any issue of title.
21. Thus, merely because Bylappa denied Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah's title, that
by itself would not amount to raising a cloud over the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and
Ningaiah and it would not be necessary for Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah to file a
suit for declaration and a suit for injunction simpliciter may be sufficient. The Supreme Court has
also stated that the Court should use its discretion carefully to identify the cases in which it would
inquire into title and the cases where it would refer the plaintiff to seek the comprehensive
declaratory suit. Thus, each case would have to be judged on its own facts to determine whether the
parties are to be relegated to the remedy of filing a declaratory suit.
22. Since, a strong argument is advanced on behalf of the respondents that they had raised a serious
cloud on the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah and the suit could not have been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 8
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
entertained, at the very outset, it will have to be determined as to whether in the present case a
serious cloud was indeed raised over the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah.
23. The case of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah's case, as stated above, was that the
suit property belonged to Kalamma (the mother of Chennaiah and the grand-mother of the
Ningaiah) who had acquired title by virtue of the registered gift deed dated 15.09.2021, executed in
her favour by her brother Arasappa (father of the defendant, Bylappa). It was their further case that
on the death of Kalamma, her husband Muddaiah and her two sons i.e., the 1st plaintiff and the
father of the 2nd plaintiff, had succeeded to the property and on the death of Muddaiah, Kalamma's
husband, the 1st plaintiff and the father of the 2nd plaintiff had succeeded to the said property.
Thus, primarily, it would have to be seen whether Kalamma had title over the suit property and
whether this title of hers was clear and free of doubt.
24. Admittedly, Bylappa is the son of Arasappa. It was the case of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah
and Ningaiah that Arasappa, the father of Bylappa had gifted the suit property to Kalamma in 1921
under a registered gift deed. In his written statement, Bylappa, at paragraph 9 of his written
statement 1 had clearly admitted the following facts:
x Hanumanthaiah had two sons and one daughter, namely Arasappa, Obaliah and
Kalamma.
The true facts are as follows:
One Hanumanthaiah, had three issues - two sons and one daughter. Arasappa, was
the eldest son and Obalaiah happended to be the second son. One Kalamma was the
daughter. The defendant, is the son of Arasappa referred to above. Obalaiah has no
issues. Arasppa was given to bad habits, he was not looking after his family. He drove
away his wife, the defendant and Obalaiah, from the house and knocked away all the
properties, and started living with his sister, Kalamma, along with his concubine one
Nagamma. Thereafter, the defendant, his mother, Nanjamma and Obalaiah, started
living with Chikkarasappa, the brother of Nanjanna and father-in-law of the
defendant. Thereafter, Obalaiah purchased the suit schedule property from Revanna,
under the registered sale deed dated 1.9.1912, and thereafter the said Obalaiah died
and Arasappa gifted the property to his sister Smt. Kalamma. Further the I defendant
mortgaged the said property in favour of the defendant dated 29-9-36, the same is
registered in the Sub-Register Nelamangala, and the Certified copy of the same is
produced herewith. Again, the defendant produced herewith the certified copy of the
preliminary record.
x Obalaiah, his father's brother, had purchased the suit property under a sale deed
dated 01.09.1912 and that the said Obalaiah had no issues.
x After Obalaiah's death, Obalaiah's brother Arasappa i.e., Bylappa's father, had
gifted the property to his sister Kalamma under a registered gift deed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 9
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
25. From this admitted plea of Bylappa in his written statement, it is clear that the suit property had
been initially acquired by Obalaiah and on Obalaiah's death, since he had no issues, the suit
property devolved onto his brother Arasappa by survivorship.
26. Further, since it is also the admitted plea of Bylappa that Arasappa, his father, had gifted the
property to his sister Kalamma under a registered gift deed, fundamentally, the acquisition of title
by Kalamma was not in dispute at all.
27. As the acquisition of title by both Arasappa and his subsequent gift to Kalamma was not in
dispute, it cannot also be in dispute that on the death of Kalamma, her sons i.e., the 1st plaintiff and
Chikkachannaiah (the father of the 2nd plaintiff) had inherited the suit property.
28. In other words, by the very case put forth by Bylappa himself, it was clear that there was no
cloud cast on the title of Kalamma (the 1st plaintiff's mother and 2nd plaintiff's grandmother) and
consequently also on the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah. In this view of the
matter, the suit instituted by Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah for injunction simpliciter
would be perfectly maintainable.
29. Yet another factor that stands out from the defence of Bylappa is that though he admitted that
his father, Arasappa had gifted the suit property to Kalamma way back in 1921 i.e., more than a
century ago he had admittedly not challenged the gift deed and as a consequence, he would be
bound by the gift that his father had made in favour of his aunt Kalamma.
30. In the light of the fact that Bylappa admitted the execution of the gift deed by his father
Arasappa in favour of Kalamma (the mother of the 1st plaintiff and grandmother of the 2nd
plaintiff), the finding of both the Courts that Arasappa had no competence to execute the gift is
wholly unsustainable and is beyond the scope of enquiry in a suit for injunction. In fact, since the
execution of the gift deed was admitted by Bylappa, both the Courts, in a suit for injunction, have
grossly erred in examining a claim on the validity of the gift and recording a finding regarding the
competence of the donor- Arasappa to execute the gift deed.
31. One another fact that is to be noticed is that the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and
Ningaiah was not really in dispute at all and was in fact admitted by Bylappa, which becomes clear
from the following facts.
32. Bylappa, in his defence, had stated that Channaiah (plaintiff No.1) had mortgaged the suit
property in his favour under the registered mortgage deed dated 29.09.1936 and this established his
title.
33. Though it was the specific and admitted plea of Bylappa that Channaiah (plaintiff No.1) had
mortgaged the suit property in his favour, he however, did not produce and get the said mortgage
deed marked. Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah, however, produced the registered
mortgage deed dated 29.09.1936 and the same has been marked as Ex.P.24. In this mortgage deed,
it has been stated as follows:

34. The recitals of the mortgage deed clearly state that in order to raise a loan of Rs.125/-,
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah was mortgaging the suit property by depositing the title deeds with
Bylappa and these recitals which are not disputed by Bylappa, by themselves establish that
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah, undoubtedly had title over the suit property. Further, since a
registered mortgage by deposit of title deeds was executed by Channaiah in favour of Bylappa, it
would be rather obvious that possession remained with Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and only the
title deeds were handed over to the Bylappa.
35. In fact, in the mortgage deed it is also stated that the suit property had been gifted by Arasaiah in
favour of Kalamma the mother of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah. As stated above, since this
registered mortgage deed dated 29.9.1936 was specifically pleaded and accepted by Bylappa in his
written statement, it cannot be in doubt that both title and possession of Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah over the suit property was admitted by Bylappa at an undisputed
point of time.
36. Bylappa also produced Ex.D.7, a statement purported to have been given by the 2nd plaintiff in
which it is stated as follows:

37. A reading of this statement indicates that it was the complaint of the 2nd plaintiff that Bylappa
was trying to obstruct the possession of the 2nd plaintiff on the ground that the land had been
mortgaged to him. This document produced by Bylappa himself, clearly establishes that Bylappa
was obstructing the possession of the 2 nd plaintiff on the ground that the property had been
mortgaged to him, which basically reflects the plea raised by Bylappa in his written statement.
38. Bylappa also produced an affidavit stated to have been filed by the 1st plaintiff in a proceeding
initiated by the 2nd plaintiff against Bylappa under the Debt Relief Act, in which it had been
admitted by the 1st plaintiff that Bylappa was the owner of the suit property and was in possession.
The affidavit, which is produced as Ex. D.8, reads as follows:
Affidavit I, Channaiah s/o Muddaiah, aged about 60 years, residing Mathahalli,
Dasanpura Hobli, Nelamangala taluk, Bangalore district, do hereby solemnly affirm
and state on oath as follows:-
1. I submit that the Sy.No.108/4, of Mathahalli village measuring to the extent of 3
acres 25 guntas of dry land has been under cultivation possession and enjoyment of
Bylappa the respondent named above. The respondent Bylappa is my maternal uncle.
Myself and my brothers Chikkachannaiah were living together till 1963. In the year
1962 by separated and they have partitioned our Hindu Joint family properties and
they have been living separately.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 13
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
The lands referred to above were never Mortgaged to the respondents. They were sold to the
respondent. The petition to discharge debt was not filed by me. The petitioner named above who is
my brother was setup by some people who are enimically disposed towards the respondent.
2. In view of the above the question of discharge of the debt does not arise.
3. I submit that I have no objection for the petition being dismissed as not maintainable."
39. As could be seen from the said affidavit, the 1st plaintiff has stated that the property was sold to
Bylappa. However, Bylappa himself did not set up a plea that he had purchased the property. The
fact that the affidavit states that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah had sold the suit
property to Bylappa presupposes that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah did possess title
over the suit property. If Bylappa accepts the contents of the affidavit in which it has been stated he
had purchased it, it would have been incumbent upon him to produce the registered instrument
under which he acquired title from Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah. However, neither
such a plea been raised nor any registered document produced to establish the title of Bylappa.
40. Bylappa in his written statement did not, either directly or indirectly, state that the suit property
had been bequeathed to Bylappa by Obalaiah. However, during his deposition, he produced an
unregistered Will dated 14.08.1918 (Ex.D.6) said to have been executed by Obalaiah. However,
Bylapp made absolutely no attempt to prove the execution of the Will by examining the attesting
witnesses and if they were unavailable, by summoning those persons who were aware of the
signatures of the attestors. Since, Bylappa did not plead in his written statement that the suit
property had been bequeathed to him, the production of this Will of the year 1918, which had not
seen the light of the day till the trial in the suit had commenced, would really be of no consequence.
41. In the light of the above discussions, it will have to be held that the Trial Court had grossly erred
in recording a finding that Arasaiah had no competence to execute the gift and the same was beyond
the scope and enquiry in a suit for injunction. The 1st substantial question of law is therefore held in
favour of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah/appellants.
42. Bylappa also stated that he was paying taxes regularly every year and the tax paid receipts
indicated his possession. The Trial Court and the Appellate Court have gone on to determine that
Bylappa had proved that he was in possession of the suit property only on the basis of revenue
records such as RTCs and tax paid receipts.
43. To prove possession, both Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah and Bylappa produced
revenue records.
44. Bylappa produced four pahanis for the years 1964-65, 1965-66, 1965-66 and 1966-67 (Ex. D.1 to
Ex. D.4) and one RTC (Ex. D.5). In the pahanis, Ex. D.1 to D.4, the Hiduvalidara (holder) is shown
as Channaiah son of Muddaiah, who is none other than the 1st plaintiff. In these pahanis, the name
of Bylappa is found in the Paludara (Sharer) or Korudara column. Thus, these four pahanis
produced by Bylappa itself reflect the name of the 1st plaintiff as the owner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 14
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
45. Bylappa produced a single RTC, which was for the period 1983-84 to 1987-88. Even in this RTC,
the name of Channaiah son of Muddaiah has been entered in the owner's column and only in the
cultivator's column, the name of Bylappa i.e., defendant No.1 has been found. The 1st plaintiff is
admittedly the son of Muddaiah and he has been described in the plaint as Channaiah @
Doddachinnaiah. Assuming that the RTC produced by Bylappa was genuine, the very said RTC
acknowledges that the 1st plaintiff is the owner of the suit property. Thus, even as per the pahanis
and the RTC i.e., the revenue records produced by Bylappa himself, the owner of the suit property is
shown to be the 1st plaintiff.
46. In order to show that Bylappa was in possession, reliance was placed on the entry in the
cultivator's column. It must be stated here that the basis on which the name of Bylappa was entered
in the cultivator's column is not forthcoming. This issue assumes importance because Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah also produced RTCs in respect of this very period in which, in the
owner's column, the name shown is Channaiah son of Muddaiah and in the cultivator's column it
has been shown as Doddachinnaiah. In other words, the single RTC produced by Bylappa varies
with the RTCs produced by Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah when it comes to the
cultivator's column.
47. In fact, to disbelieve the RTCs which contained the name of the 1st plaintiff, the Appellate Court
reasoned that the basis for entering his name in the RTCs was not forthcoming. However, for the
RTC produced by Bylappa, the same yardstick was not applied by the Appellate Court. Bylappa has
admittedly not produced any document to establish as to on what basis his name was entered in the
cultivator's column and yet he relied upon the very same RTC, in which the name of the 1st plaintiff
is shown to be the owner, as proof of his possession. As stated above, Bylappa claimed that he was
the owner of the suit property and yet the very revenue documents produced by him indicated that
the 1st plaintiff was the owner of the suit property. This glaring contradiction in the RTCs cast a
serious doubt on the veracity of the RTC produced by Bylappa.
48. It may also be relevant to state here that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah produced
an extract of the Preliminary Register (Ex.P.2) [which was also produced by Bylappa and was
marked as (Ex. D-10)] in which the name of the 1st plaintiff's father Muddaiah's name and the name
of the 1st plaintiff had been entered as owners. The said preliminary register also records gift deed
executed in favour of Kalamma in 1921 and also the mortgage deed dated 28.09.1936 executed by
the 1st plaintiff in favour of Bylappa. These entries in the Preliminary register confirm the flow of
title to Kalamma and also to her husband and her son.
49. Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah also produced three RTCs for the period 1983-84
to 87-88, 1988- 89 to 90-91 and 1988-89 to 92-93 as (Ex.P.3 to Ex.P.5) and in all these RTCs, the
name of Channaiah is recorded in the owner's column and in the cultivator's column, the name of
Doddachinnaiah is recorded. In addition to the RTCs, Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah
also produced Patta Books Ex.P.7 and Ex.P.8 in which it is recorded that Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah had remitted the taxes for the period of 1973-4 to 1990-91 and they also produced
tax paid receipts (Ex.P.9 to Ex.P.23) for the years 1989-90 up to 2000-2001. In all these documents,
the name of the 1st plaintiff was shown as the Khatedar who was paying the taxes. These revenue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 15
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
records i.e, the Pahanis, the RTCs and the Patta Books which corroborate with each other clearly
indicate that the revenue records support the fact that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah
were in possession not only as on the date of the suit but also for a considerably long period of time
prior to the filing of the suit.
50. The Appellate Court though held that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah had
produced the revenue records indicating their possession right from the year 1965 to 1988-89, i.e.,
till the filing of the suit, it has nevertheless proceeded to ignore these documents on the ground that
the basis on which the revenue records had been entered was not forthcoming from the revenue
records. The Appellate Court has failed to notice that revenue records in which the name of
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah stood for more than 20 years was admitted by Bylappa
in his written statement wherein he stated that he had challenged the entries before the Tahsildar.
This assertion of Bylappa establishes the entry of the 1st plaintiff's name were found in the revenue
records for a considerably long period of time, which leads to the inference that Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah were in possession of the suit property.
51. Bylappa also stated that a letter had been issued by the Officer on Special Duty for the Supply of
Fuel, Bangalore city, under Rule 75-A of the Defence of India Rules, addressed to him, as per Ex
D-9, stating that the suit property was being requisitioned and in it, it had been clearly stated that he
was in possession and this also established his right over the property. A perusal of this document
indicates that the survey number of the land itself is not mentioned and therefore, this document
cannot in any way establish the possession of Bylappa over the suit property.
52. It is therefore clear that though there were revenue records which clearly indicated the
possession of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah, both the Courts have chosen to ignore
the same by misreading them completely and arriving at a completely erroneous conclusion. In
conclusion, since the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah was not in doubt and the
documents produced by them clearly indicated their possession for a considerably long period of
time, both the Courts were not justified in dismissing the suit and the same are therefore required to
be set aside and as a consequence, the established possession of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and
Ningaiah would have to be protected by a decree of injunction.
Regarding the second substantial question of law:
53. It is not in dispute that during the pendency of the suit itself, both the 1st plaintiff and Bylappa
died and their legal representative were brought on record and these legal representatives
prosecuted not only the suit but also the appeal which arose out of the dismissal of the suit and also
this second appeal. The argument that is sought to be advanced in this second appeal is that the suit
being one for injunction, on the death of the 1st plaintiff, the suit could not continue and similarly
on the death of Bylappa, the suit had to abate.
54. The moot question that therefore arises for consideration in this second appeal is whether the
right to sue survives in a suit instituted for injunction simpliciter?

Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
55. An injunction, as stated under the Specific Relief Act, is a preventive relief granted at the
discretion of the Court. An injunction, which is granted up to a limited time or until further orders of
the court, is called a temporary injunction, while an injunction granted by a decree at the hearing of
the suit and upon merits of the suit, is called a perpetual injunction. A decree of perpetual injunction
perpetually enjoins a defendant from the assertion of his right or from the commission of an act
which is contrary to the rights of the plaintiff. There is absolutely nothing indicated in provision of
Part III or Part IV of the Specific Relief, which even remotely indicates that an injunction is a right
which is personal to the plaintiff.
56. A personal right is a right that can be enjoyed only by an individual on his own and it is a right
that cannot survive his life. Such kinds of personal rights are relatable only to a limited category of
suits, such as a suit for defamation, suit for damages for the personal injuries suffered, a suit for
bankruptcy, a suit for dissolution of marriage, etc.,
57. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of PURAN SINGH AND OTHERS VS. STATE OF PUNJAB
AND OTHERS reported in (1996) 2 SCC 205 has stated as follows:
"4. A personal action dies with the death of the person on the maxim "action
personalis moritur cum persona". But this operates only in a limited class of actions
ex delicto, such as action for damages for defamation, assault or other personal
injuries not causing the death of the party, and in other actions where after the death
of the party the granting of the relief would be nugatory. (Girja Nandini v. Bijendra
Narain, 1967 (1) SCR 93). But there are other cases where the right to sue survives in
spite of the death of the person against whom the proceeding had been initiated and
such right continues to exist against the legal representative of the deceased who was
a party to the proceeding. Order 22 of the Code deals with this aspect of the matter.
Rule 1 of Order 22 says that the death of a plaintiff or defendant shall not cause the
suit to abate if the right to sue survives. That is why whenever a party to a suit dies,
the first question which is to be decided is as to whether the right to sue survives or
not. If the right is held to be a personal right which is extinguished with the death of
the person concerned and does not devolve on the legal representatives or successors,
then it is an end of the suit. Such suit, therefore, cannot be continued. But if the right
to sue survives against the legal representative of the original defendant, then
procedures have been prescribed in Order 22 to bring the legal representative on
record within the time prescribed. In view of Rule 4 of Order 22 where one of two or
more defendants dies and the right to sue does not survive against the surviving
defendant or defendants alone, or a sole defendant dies and the right to sue survives,
the Court, on an application being made in that behalf, shall cause the legal
representatives of the deceased defendant to be made a party and shall proceed with
the suit. If within the time prescribed by Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1963 no
application is made under sub-rule (1) of Rule 4, the suit shall abate as against the
deceased defendant. This Rule is based not only on the sound principle that a suit
cannot proceed against a dead person, but also on the principle of natural justice that
if the original defendant is dead, then no decree can be passed against him so as to

bind his legal representative without affording an opportunity to them to contest the
claim of the plaintiff. Rule 9 of Order 22 of the Code prescribes the procedure for
setting aside abatement.
Thus, it is only in certain specified suits that the prayers made in the plaint does not
and cannot survive beyond the life of the parties and it is only in those limited kinds
of cases that a suit would abate on the death of either the plaintiff or defendant.
58. The right to enjoy possession of an immovable property is not a right that can be enjoyed only by
one person and it is not a right that cannot survive beyond the life of that person. The right to enjoy
property is a transferable right and thus is not limited to any one person. On the death of a person,
the right to enjoy possession of that property can and does survive to his legal representative.
59. A legal representative is defined under Section 2 (11) of the CPC and the same reads as under:
"legal representative" means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased
person, and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased
and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom
the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued.
60. As could be seen from the said definition, a person who intermeddles with the estate of the
deceased is also considered a legal representative. Thus, a person in whose favour the rights of a
property devolve by operation of law or by way of a testament would be a legal representative since
he acquires a right to intermeddle with the estate of the deceased. Thus, it is clear that in a suit
relating to the grant of a perpetual injunction in respect of an immovable property, the right to sue is
not personal to the plaintiff but survives to his legal representative and the suit for injunction would
not therefore abate.
61. In fact, the prayer of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah in the suit was as follows:
"WHEREFORE, it is prayed that this Hon'ble Court be pleased to grant permanent
injunction, restraining the defendant, his agents, fellowmen or any one claiming on
his behalf from interfering with the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the suit
schedule property of the plaintiffs and also not to remove the jack fruit free and not
to cut in the suit schedule lands and to issue such other relief and this Hon'ble Court
deems fit to grant in the circumstances of the case, in the interests of justice and
equity."
62. It is thus clear from the prayer of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah itself that they
had not only sought for a decree of injunction against Bylappa but also against anyone claiming
through Bylappa. Thus, on the death of Bylappa, since the right of Bylappa does survive to his legal
representatives, the suit would not abate and would have to continue against anyone claiming under
Bylappa as his legal representative.

63. If it is to be held that in a suit for injunction, whenever a plaintiff or a defendant dies, the suit
would abate, it would be virtually creating a never ending cycle of litigation, which obviously would
result in an absurd situation where a party to suit is to be perennially litigating in courts.
64. In this regard, a reference must be made to Section 306 of the Indian Succession Act, which
reads as follows:
"306. Demands and rights of action of or against deceased survive to and against
executor or administrator. --
All demands whatsoever, and all rights to prosecute or defend any action or special
proceeding existing in favour of or against a person at the time of his decease, survive
to and against his executors or administrators; except causes of action for
defamation, assault, as defined in the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (45 of 1860) or other
personal injuries not causing the death of the party; and except also cases where,
after the death of the party, the relief sought could not be enjoyed or granting it
would be nugatory".
65. A reading of this section makes it abundantly clear that except for causes of actions relating to a.
defamation, assault or other personal injuries not causing the death of the person and b. except in
the cases where upon the death of the party, the party cannot enjoy it or granting it would be
nugatory, all other causes of action survive the deceased. In a suit for injunction in relation to an
immovable property, obviously, the legal representative of the deceased would enjoy the relief that
the original party (plaintiff or defendant) would have been entitled to by virtue of the succession or
inheritance in their favour and thus the suit would not abate and would have to be continued by
bringing the legal representatives of the deceased on record.
66. It is not in dispute that during the pendency of this appeal, Bylappa has alienated the suit
property to a Society and the Society in turn claims to have obtained approvals to form a layout and
thereafter allotted sites to its members. The Society has been impleaded as the 6th respondent and
an application is also filed by the members of the said Society seeking to implead themselves as
additional respondents. Documents are also sought to be produced to evidence the sale transaction
and the approvals.
67. In respect of these alienations, it is needless to state that they are hit by the doctrine of lis
pendens and neither the Society nor its members can escape the consequences of a decree being
suffered by their vendor. This position is made explicitly clear by the Hon'ble Apex Court in more
than one decision. It would however be suffice to quote just one decision rendered by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of RAJ KUMAR VS SARDARI LAL AND OTHERS reported in (2004) 2 SCC
601, in which it has been stated as follows:
"5. The doctrine of lis pendens expressed in the maxim 'ut lite pendente nihil
innovetur' (during a litigation nothing new should be introduced) has been statutorily
incorporated in Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882. A defendant cannot,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/44908573/ 19
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah vs Bylappa Since Dead By His Ls on 11 April, 2022
by alienating property during the pendency of litigation, venture into depriving the
successful plaintiff of the fruits of the decree. The transferee pendente lite is treated
in the eye of law as a representative-in-interest of the judgment-debtor and held
bound by the decree passed against the judgment-debtor though neither has the
defendant chosen to bring the transferee on record by apprising his opponent and the
Court of the transfer made by him nor has the transferee chosen to come on record by
taking recourse to Order 22 Rule 10 of the CPC. In case of an assignment, creation or
devolution of any interest during the pendency of any suit, Order 22 Rule 10 of the
CPC confers a discretion on the Court hearing the suit to grant leave for the person in
or upon whom such interest has come to vest or devolve to be brought on record.
Bringing of a lis pendens transferee on record is not as of right but in the discretion of
the Court. Though not brought on record the lis pendens transferee remains bound
by the decree."
68. In the light of the ratio laid down in this decision, the Society or its members would be bound by
the decree passed against their vendor and they would consequently be also debarred from
interfering with the possession of the 1st plaintiff and his legal heirs.
69. In the result, the second substantial question of law is also held in favour of Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah by holding that the relief of injunction would continue subsequent to
the death of Bylappa, the original defendant and also the sale by his legal heirs in favour of the 6th
defendant.
Regarding the 3rd substantial question of law:
70. As already discussed above, Ex.P.24, the mortgage deed, which is admitted by the original
defendant, Bylappa, in his written statement, itself indicates that the suit property belonged to
Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah and they were mortgaging the said property to secure
a sum of Rs.125/- that they were borrowing from the original defendant. Both the Courts have
committed a serious error in not even noticing this document Ex.P.24, though Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah produced it and the original defendant also pleaded about the
mortgage.
71. As already held above, the contents of this mortgage deed, establish that Bylappa was directly
admitting the title of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah and the complete disregard of
this document by both the Courts have vitiated the judgments rendered by them.
72. Thus, the 3rd question of law is also answered in favour of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and
Ningaiah/appellants.
73. In view of all the three substantial questions of law being held in favour of Chennaiah @
Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah, the judgments of both the courts are required to be set aside and
they are accordingly set aside.

74. Further, since it has been established that Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah and Ningaiah were in
lawful possession of the suit property, the suit of Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah is decreed as
prayed for. It is also hereby made clear that this decree would be binding not only on the legal
representatives of the deceased original defendant (i.e., respondents 1 to 5 in this appeal) but also on
the 6th respondent-Society and its members.
75. The second appeal is accordingly allowed and the suit of the Chennaiah @ Doddachennaiah, the
1st plaintiff is decreed as prayed for.
