PRONOUNCEMENT OF ORDERS THIS DAY, P.S.DINESH
KUMAR.J, PRONOUNCED THE FOLLOWING:-
W.P No.9554/2021

ORDER
All these writ petitions are filed by the Union of India, Ministry of Finance, challenging the common
order dated March 4, 2020 in O.A. Nos.170/1621/2018 and connected cases except O.A.
No.170/01622/2018.
2. We have heard Shri. B.Pramod, learned Central Government Counsel and Shri. B.S. Venkatesh
Kumar for respondents. They submitted that the issue involved in these writ petitions are common
and counter affidavit has been filed in W.P. No.1141/2021. Hence, we have heard all these cases
simultaneously by adverting to the pleadings in the said writ petition.
3. Common facts in these writ petitions are, respondents on each petition joined as Inspectors &
connected matters with the Central Excise Department. They have completed 24 years of service as
on 01.09.2008.
4. ACP1 Scheme was introduced with effect from August 9, 1999. Respondents were given the
benefit of first ACP, namely, first financial up-gradation in PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.4,800/- with
effect from 09.08.1999. They were promoted as Superintendents in 2001 in PB-2 with grade pay of
Rs.2,800/-. On January 1, 2006, NFG/NFSG was given in PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.5,400/-. On
December 24, 2006, second ACP was given in PB-3 with grade pay of Rs.5,400/-. On October 22,
2014, third financial up-gradation was given under MACP in PB-3 with Grade pay of Rs.6,600/-.
5. As per letter F.No.A-23011/29/2010- Ad.IIA dated June 4, 2014, the Respondents were of the
opinion that the NFG/NFSG granted between Assured Career Progression & connected matters
01.01.2006 and 31.08.2008 would be counted/off- set against financial up-gradation under MACP
Scheme. A Show-cause notice dated August 4, 2014 was issued calling upon the respondent in W.P
No.1141/2021 as to:
"(i) why the 3rd financial upgradation to the Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- in PB-3 of
Rs.15600-
39100/- under MACP Scheme granted to him with effect from 24.12.2012 should not be withdrawn
as he has already been granted one promotion and two financial upgradations as mentioned above,
and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148804012/ 44
Union Of India vs V. S. Patilkulkarni on 3 June, 2022
(ii) why the excess of pay and allowances drawn and paid to him from 24.12.2012 on account of
grant of the said 3rd financial upgradation to the Grade pay of Rs.6600/- in PB-3 under MACP
Scheme should not be recovered."
6. Respondent submitted his reply to the show-cause notice. After hearing him, order dated June 29,
2018 was passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, withdrawing third financial up-gradation
to the grade pay of Rs.6,600/- in PB-3 under MACP Scheme and recovery of pay and & connected
matters allowances, if any, paid to him consequent to third financial up-gradation under MACP
Scheme.
7. Feeling aggrieved, respondent filed the instant O.A. before the CAT with a prayer inter alia to
set-aside the order dated June 29, 2018 and for a consequential direction to restore the higher grade
pay granted to him. The O.A. was contested by the petitioners. The CAT, on consideration of
material on record and the contentions urged on behalf of both sides, vide common impugned order
has allowed the O.A., holding that the respondents are eligible for third financial up-gradation
despite the fact that he was given non-functional grade pay earlier. Hence, these writ petitions.
8. Shri. Pramod, learned CGC for the Revenue submitted that the sixth Central Pay Commission
recommended a systematic change in the ACP whereby all employees irrespective of & connected
matters hierarchical structure, would get the same benefit. The ACP Scheme was replaced by
MACP2 (Modified ACP), which provided for three up-gradations after 10, 20 and 30 years
respectively in the successive grade-pay in the pattern of recommended revised pay band and grade
pay as prescribed in the CCS(RP) Rules3, 2008 and not in the promotional hierarchy under the ACP
Scheme.
9. He further submitted that in para 8.1 of MACP Scheme, it is provided that grade-pay of
Rs.5,400/- in PB-2 and Rs.5,400/- in PB-3 shall be treated as separate grade pay for the purpose of
grant upgradating under MACP scheme. The superintendents in the Grade pay of Rs.4,800/- got
NFG4 in grade pay of Rs.5,400/- in PB-2 after four years of regular service. On promotion to the
post of Assistant Commissioner, they were placed in Modified Assured Career Progression Central
Civil Services (Revised pay) Non Functional Grade & connected matters PB-3 with Grade pay of
Rs.5,400/-. Thus, Superintendents are claiming MACP benefit, ignoring the NFG granted to them.
According to him, respondents' claim for financial up-gradation under MACP in the promotional
hierarchy, goes against the intent of the MACP Scheme.
10. In substance, he submitted that the non-functional grade given, have to be accountable for the
purpose of grant of benefits under the MACP.
11. Shri. B.S. Venkatesh Kumar for the respondents in all cases submitted:
• that some of the respondents had got their first promotion to the post of
Superintendent before 09.08.1999, the date on which ACP Scheme was introduced.
The promotion, so earned is treated as one count of up-

Union Of India vs V. S. Patilkulkarni on 3 June, 2022
gradation. Some of the respondents had put & connected matters in 12 years of
service, as on 09.08.1999.
Having regard to the stagnation in several Departments, the Central Government
introduced the ACP with effect from 09.08.1999, which envisaged two financial
up-gradations once in 12 years by way of granting pay scale attached to the next
higher hierarchical post to be subsumed as and when actual promotion was granted.
The respondents who had put in 12 years of service as on 09.08.1999, were given the
pay scale that was attached to the post of Superintendent i.e first Financial
up-gradation on 09.08.1999 from pay scale of Rs.6,500-
200-10,500/- to the pay scale of Rs.7,500- 250-12,000. This enhancement was subsumed as and
when they got their regular promotion as Superintendents;
& connected matters • the Central Government implemented the recommendation of the sixth CPC
retrospectively, from 01.01.2006, whereby the concept of pay band and grade pay were introduced.
As provided in the Schedule to the CCS(Revised pay) Rules, 2008, the post of Superintendent
carried two pay scales namely PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.4,800/- initially and PB-2 with grade pay
of Rs.5,400/- after four years. Accordingly, the pay of those respondents who had put in more than
four years as on 01.01.2006 was fixed in PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.5,400/-. In case of other
respondents, their pay was initially fixed in PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.4,800/- as on 01.01.2006 and
enhanced to PB-2, with grade pay of Rs.5,400/- as and when they completed four years of service;
& connected matters • the ACP Scheme was prevalent till 31.08.2008. All respondents who had put
it more than 24 years of service were eligible for the benefit of the Scheme and their pay was revised
in PB-3 with Grade pay of Rs.5,400/-;
• with effect form 01.09.2008, the Central Government introduced MACP, where under, an Officer
would get up-gradation at the end of 10, 20 and 30 years of service, reckoned from the date of
joining. The enhancement of pay was restricted to next higher grade-pay in the recommended scale,
as provided in Part-A, Section I of the Schedule to CCS(Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 instead of pay
attached to the next higher hierarchical post. Accordingly, all respondents have been granted third
financial up-gradation as and when they completed 30 years of service & connected matters from
the date of joining, in PB-3 with Grade pay of Rs.6,600/-.
12. In substance, learned Advocate for the respondents in all cases, submitted that the NFG granted
to the respondents cannot be counted as a financial up-gradation. In support of this contention, he
urged that the Central Government have accepted the decision of the Madras High Court in the case
of R. Chandrashekaran Vs. The Central Administrative Tribunal and others5. He argued that the
respondents are similarly situated and therefore, they are also entitled for the third up-gradation
and the CAT has rightly held that the respondents are entitled for the benefit and prayed for
dismissal these writ petitions.

9003 & connected matters
14. Undisputed facts of the case are, respondents have joined service as Inspectors. They have been
given the first financial up- gradation in PB-2 with grade pay of Rs.4,800/-. When they were
promoted to the post of Superintendent, they were given PB-2 with Grade pay of Rs.4,800/-. After
completion of four years, they have been given NFG in PB-2 with Grade pay of Rs.5,400/-. They
have got the second ACP in 2006 in PB-3 with Grade pay of Rs.5,400/-. They have been given the
third financial up-gradation in PB-3 with Grade pay of Rs.6,600/-, with effect from December 24,
2012.
15. Petitioners contend that the NFG given on 01.01.2006 in PB-2 with Grade pay of Rs.5,400/-
must be treated as second financial up- gradation.
& connected matters
16. In the case of R. Chandrashekaran Vs. The Central Administrative Tribunal and others, the
Madras High Court has held that it is not in dispute that R. Chandrashekaran had joined the service
of Customs and Central Excise Department in 1982. He was promoted to the grade of
Superintendent in April 2001.
17. Shri. R. Chandrashekaran was given third financial upgradation after completing 30 years of
service. He was given the pay scale of Rs.15600-39100 in Pay Band-3 with Grade Pay of Rs.6600/-
by order dated 12 December 2012.
18. The Revenue had stopped the Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- on the premise that the Ministry of
Finance vide Circular dated April 8, 2013 had clarified that any further extension of benefits and III
MACP with Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- to Superintendents, who were in receipt of Non-
& connected matters Functional Grade under PB-2 with Grade Pay of Rs.5400/- as per II ACP,
under PB-3 with Rs.5400/- Grade Pay required the concurrence of the Do & PT. Chandrashekaran
had challenged the same in OA No.675/2013 before the CAT challenging the circular dated 8 April
2013 and for a direction to permit him to draw the pay in the Grade Pay of Rs.6600/- with arrears.
The CAT, Chennai dismissed the O.A. and the same was challenged in the Madras High Court in
W.P. No.19024/2014 and it was disposed of with the following directions:
"17. Since the Central Administrative Tribunal has taken a decision not withstanding
the claim made by the petitioner and in view of our decision to direct the Department
of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to consider the issue once again, we set
aside the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal dated 24 February
2014 in O.A.No.675 of 2013 and remit the matter to the Department of Personnel,
Public Grievances and Pensions for fresh consideration. The Department of
Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is directed to consider the 21 issue in
extenso in the light of the provisions of MACP Scheme and & connected matters the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148804012/ 47
Union Of India vs V. S. Patilkulkarni on 3 June, 2022
benefits given to the employees like the petitioner to count the nonfunctional scale
for the purpose of ACPS. Such exercise shall be completed within a period of three
months from the date of receipt of a copy of this writ petition."
19. The Commissioner, while passing the order dated June 29, 2018, impugned before the CAT has
recorded in para 27 of his order as follows:
"27. Thus, the cases involved in the above judgments are not exactly similar to the
cases of the officer. Notwithstanding the same, as regards the interpretation of para
8.1 of the Annexure to DOPT's OM dated 19.5.2009 by the Hon'ble Tribunal, Madras
upheld by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras, and the judgment dated 19.10.2011 of
the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana in CWP No.19387/2011, the judgment
dated 26.11.2012 of the Hon'ble CAT Principal Bench, New Delhi in OA No.904/2012
and the judgment dated 24.08.2012 of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in W.P.(C)
5146/2012 in the case of UOI Vs Delhi Nurses Union (Regd.) and another, wherein it
has been held that the financial upgradtions under the MACP Scheme has to be
associated with the next higher promotional post, I find that, in the absence of
specific orders from the DoPT modifying the existing features of the MACP Scheme,
the existing features/provisions of the & connected matters Scheme and related
instructions issued by the DoPT and the CBEC shall hold."
20. Further, in para 17 of the Statement of objections filed before the CAT, petitioners have taken a
specific stand that in the case of Chandrashekaran, the Department has preferred an appeal against
the verdict of the Madras High Court and the decision is still pending consideration before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.
21. In para 10 of the writ petition, the petitioners have contended that the directions of the Madras
High Court in the case of Chandrashekaran, was referred to DoP & T for taking appropriate action.
Initially, DoP & T vide communication, Dy. No.1078183 CR.15 dated 06.05.2015, had opined that
since Chandrashekaran had got only one promotion and the second ACP in the Grade pay of
Rs.5,400/- was given prior to implementation of MACP, he was & connected matters entitled for
grant of MACP in the Grade pay of Rs.6,600/- on completion of 30 years of service. Subsequently,
on re-examination, DoP & T had clarified that grant of NFG was required to be counted as one
financial up-gradation. It is further averred in para 11 that the initial advise of the DoP & T was
communicated to the Chennai Commissionerate for taking appropriate action and filing compliance

Union Of India vs V. S. Patilkulkarni on 3 June, 2022
23. The Commissioner while ordering withdrawal of third financial up-gradation, has held that in
the absence of specific orders from the DoP & T modifying the features of the MACP, the existing
instructions issued by the DoP & T and the CBEC6 are binding.
24. The upshot of the discussion is, the petitioners have complied with the directions of the Madras
High Court in the case of Chandrashekaran based on the initial opinion of the DoP & T. It is their
present stand that the order of Madras High Court is under challenge and the adjudication is based
on the existing instructions. This stand of the petitioner is in violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India.
25. It is settled that fixation of pay and other benefits are within the domain of the executive. In
Central Board of Excise & Customs & connected matters the event, petitioners were to succeed in
their challenge in Chandrashekara's case, the Central Government shall suffer financial loss. At the
same time, petitioners having complied with the order of the Madras High Court in
Chandrashekara's case, are bound to extend the same benefit to the respondents herein.
26. In view of the above, in our considered view, it would be just and appropriate to modify the
order passed by the CAT suitably.
27. Hence, the following:
