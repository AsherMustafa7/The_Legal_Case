9. Challenging the impugned judgment and sentence passed by
the Trial Court, it is submitted by the Counsel for the appellants, that
there are material omissions and contradictions in the evidence of the
witnesses. The evidence of the witnesses is not corroborated by
forensic examination. Admittedly there was an enmity between the
parties, and the complainant party was facing trial for murder of
Ramcharan, therefore, the appellants have been falsely implicated.
10. Per contra, the Counsel for the State has supported the findings
recorded by the Trial Court. It is submitted that enmity is a double
edged weapon and on one hand, if enmity provides a motive to
falsely implicate a person, but at the same time, it also provides
motive to commit the offence. The manner in which both the
deceased persons were beheaded by the appellants, clearly indicates,
that the offence was committed with a solitary intention to take

12. Before adverting to the facts of the case, this Court thinks it
apposite to consider as to whether the death of Lakhan and Sonu was

on his front, therefore, atleast two gun shots must have been fired,

The Supreme Court in the case of State of Maharashtra Vs.
Bharat Fakira Dhiwar reported in (2002)1 SCC 622 has held as
under :
22. In the present case the grinding stone was found in tall
grass. The pants and underwear were buried. They were out
of visibility of others in normal circumstances. Until they
were disinterred, at the instance of the respondent, their
hidden state had remained unhampered. The respondent alone knew where they were until he
disclosed it. Thus we see no substance in this submission also.
49. The Supreme Court in the case of Yakub Abdul Razak Memon v. State of Maharashtra, reported
in (2013) 13 SCC 1 has held as under :
1844. On the issue of recovery, this Court in State of H.P. v. Jeet Singh, held: (SCC p.
378, para 26) "26. There is nothing in Section 27 of the Evidence Act which renders
the statement of the accused inadmissible if recovery of the articles was made from
any place which is 'open or accessible to others'. It is a fallacious notion that when
recovery of any incriminating article was made from a place which is open or
accessible to others, it would vitiate the evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence
Act. Any object can be concealed in places which are open or accessible to others. For
example, if the article is Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008)
Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of
2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) buried in the main
roadside or if it is concealed beneath dry leaves lying on public places or kept hidden
in a public office, the article would remain out of the visibility of others in normal
circumstances.
Until such article is disinterred, its hidden state would remain unhampered. The person who hid it
alone knows where it is until he discloses that fact to any other person. Hence, the crucial question is
not whether the place was accessible to others or not but whether it was ordinarily visible to others.

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
If it is not, then it is immaterial that the concealed place is accessible to others."
(emphasis supplied) 1845. In State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Fakira Dhiwar, this Court also dealt
with this issue.
1846. Thus, in view of the above, the submission made by Mr Mushtaq Ahmed, stating that as the
recovery had been made from an open place to which all persons had access, cannot be relied upon
and is not worth acceptance. 1847. Undoubtedly, the appellant's disclosure statement had been
made before the police, as well as the panch witness. The fact that he did not disclose the place
where the contraband had been hidden remains entirely insignificant, for the reason that he had led
the police party to the said place, and that the said recovery had been made at his behest. The open
space from where the recovery had been made though was accessible to anybody, it must be
remembered that the contraband had been hidden, and that it was only after digging was done at
the place shown by the appellant, that such recovery was made. Hence, it would have been
impossible for a normal person having access to the said place, to know where the contraband goods
were hidden.
50. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellants that since, the recovery of the severed
head of Lakhan was on the joint disclosure by three appellants, therefore, it cannot be said that the
severed head of Lakhan was recovered from the discovery information given by any of them.
Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008)
51. The submission made by the Counsel for the appellants is misconceived and is hereby rejected.
52. The Supreme Court in the case of Kishore Bhadke Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in AIR
2017 SC 279 has held as under :
19. It was contended by the counsel for the accused No.3 that the evidence regarding
discovery of the dead body of Raman cannot be used against accused No.3. Inasmuch
as, when accused No.3 gave his statement and recorded in the form of Memorandum
under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, the Police already knew about the spot where
the dead body was thrown as it was disclosed by accused No.2. It was contended that
the statement made by accused No.2 can be used only against accused No.2. This
argument has been negatived by the Trial Court after analyzing the decisions which
were brought to its notice, as can be discerned from para 46 to para 53 of the
judgment. The Trial Court found that in the present case the accused Nos.2 and 3
made disclosure (about the spot where dead body of Raman was thrown by them)
one after another in quick succession and that their statement came to be recorded
separately. The only thing that had happened was a joint discovery made at the
instance of both the accused Nos.2 and 3, on proceeding to the spot along with the
police. Section 27 of the Evidence Act is an exception to Section 25 of the Act. Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 24
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
25 mandates that no confession to a Police Officer while in police custody shall be
proved as against a person accused of any offence. Section 27, however, provides that
any fact deposed to and discovered in consequence of information received from a
person accused of any offence, in the custody of a Police Officer, so much of such
information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the
fact thereby discovered, may be proved. The fact where the dead body of deceased
Raman was disposed, was disclosed by both the accused Nos.2 and 3 to the
Investigating Officer in the presence of SK Idris (PW 2) one after another on 12th
May, 2003 at 3.05 hrs. and 3.25 hrs. respectively. The discovery was made only after
accused Nos.2 and 3 were taken together by the police to the spot in the neighbouring
State (Madhya Pradesh), where the recovery Panchnama was recorded bearing
Exh.76A. In Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr
Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of
2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir &
Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) other words, the disclosure of the
relevant fact by accused No.3 to the Investigating Officer preceeded the discovery of
dead body from the disclosed spot at the instance of both the accused Nos. 2 and 3. It
was not a case of recording of statement of accused No.3 after discovery nor a joint
statement of accused Nos.2 and 3, but disclosure made by them separately in quick
succession to the Investigating Officer, preceding the discovery of the fact so stated.
The fact disclosed by them, therefore, and the discovery made at their instance, was
admissible against both the accused in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Act.
20. In the case of State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu,20this Court has held that a
joint disclosure or simultaneous disclosures, per se, are not inadmissible under
Section 27. A person accused need not necessarily be a single person, but it could be a
plurality of the accused. The Court held that a joint or simultaneous disclosure is a
myth, because two or more accused persons would not have uttered informatory
words in chorus. When two persons in custody are interrogated separately and
simultaneously and both of them may furnish similar information leading to the
discovery of fact which was reduced into writing, such disclosure by two or more
persons in police custody do not go out of the purview of Section 27 altogether. What
is relevant is that information given by one after the other without any break, almost
simultaneously, as in the present case and such information is followed up by
pointing out the material things by both of them then there is no good reason to
eschew such evidence from the regime of Section
27. Whether that information is credible is a matter of evaluation of evidence. The
Courts below have accepted the prosecution version in this behalf, being credible.
Suffice it to say that the disclosure made by Accused No. 3 about the relevant fact, per
se, is not inadmissible.
53. Thus, the recovery of head of Lakhan on the disclosure statements made by Teerth, Jagdish and
Hemraj is proved beyond reasonable doubt.

68. Two broken pieces of handles of guns were seized from the spot. In the F.S.L. report, one broken
piece of handle was marked as Article G and the single barrel gun seized from the possession of
Teerath is marked as Article A2. As per F.S.L., Article G which is a broken piece of handle of a gun
got physically fit at the broken area of handle of gun Article A2 (seized from Teerath).
69. As per F.S.L. report, one fired cartridge EC4, was fired from the gun seized from the possession
of Teerath, Article A2.
70. The .12 live cartridge could have been fired from gun/pistol A1 to A3 i.e., seized from Randhir
A1, and Teerath A2 and A.3. Nitrate was found in the barrel of pistol A1 (Seized from Randhir),
Single Barrel gun A2 (Seized from Teerath) and Country made pistol A3 (Seized from Teerath).

fact, that gun shots were fired.
71. It was also held that the pallets recovered from the body of Rambabu could have been fired from

72. As per the F.S.L., no blood was found on any of the weapon seized from the possession of the
accused persons, except on the handle of Sword seized from the possession of Randhir.
73. Challenging the veracity of the evidence of the witnesses, it is submitted by the Counsel for the
appellants, that since, the witnesses and their relatives are facing trial for killing Ramcharan,
therefore, they are interested and related witnesses and thus, are not reliable.
74. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the parties.
75. Appellant Radheshyam who is alleged to have killed Lakhan by causing gun shot injury, is the
son of Ramcharan, whereas Appellants Jagdish, Hemraj are sons of Appellants Radheshyam.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 27
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
Deceased Lakhan Singh was also one of the accused of committing murder of Ramcharan. The
appellants have relied upon judgment dated 3-4-2007, Ex. D.17, passed by Add. Sessions Judge,
Chachoda, Distt. Guna in S.T. No. 99/2005, by which all the accused persons have been convicted.
76. From the judgment, Ex. D.17, it is clear that Ramcharan had died because of incised wound on
his head. In Sessions Trial No. 99/2005, Radheshyam, Jagdish, Hemraj, Ramdayal, Pritam Singh,
were also the witnesses.
77. In the F.I.R., Ex. P.3, it has been specifically mentioned by Raghuvir (P.W.2) that they were
going to attend the Court case. This witness in his Court evidence has stated that Appellant Randhir
had abducted Karibai, a girl of the family of this witness. After the death of grand mother of this
witness, it was decided that they will not invite the family of accused persons, and therefore, enmity
started between both the families and on earlier occasions also, fight had taken place between both
the parties. In Sessions Trial No. 99/2005, Ex. D.17, the Trial Court in para 62 of the judgment has
observed that both the parties have accepted enmity with each other. Thus, it is clear that the
complainant and accused persons were on inimical Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of
2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors.
Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) terms. However, enmity is a double edged weapon. On one
hand, if enmity provides a ground for falsely implicating the accused persons, then at the same time,
it also provides reason for committing the offence. Therefore, it is necessary to appreciate the
evidence of witnesses carefully and meticulously.
78. As already pointed out, the deceased Ramcharan (S.T. No. 99/2015, Ex.D.17) had died due to
head injury which was allegedly caused by Dharat Singh, father of the deceased Lakhan. Dharat
Singh was in jail, whereas Lakhan was on bail. Thus, in order to take revenge, the appellants had
valid reason to attack Lakhan. Further, Rambabu (P.W.3) was also an accused in S.T. No. 99/2015,
Ex.D.17, therefore, the appellants had reason to attack Rambabu (P.W.3). Sonu was a boy of 12 years
and he was not involved in any litigation between the parties, but he was son of Dharat Singh. But
the witnesses have stated that since, the appellants were inclined to kill every body who could have
carried forwarded the lineage of the complainant party, therefore, he too was killed.
79. As already pointed from the Post-mortem reports of Lakhan and Sonu, their heads were severed
by the accused persons. Why the heads of Lakhan and Sonu were severed, specifically when, both of
them had already suffered gun shot injuries. The answer lies in the post-mortem report of
Ramcharan (Deceased in S.T. No. 99/2005, Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008)
Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of
2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) Ex. D.17). He had suffered a solitary injury on his head. Therefore,
the intention of the appellants was not only to kill Lakhan Singh who was not only an accused in S.T.
No. 99/2005, but was also the son of Dharat Singh, who was alleged to be the main accused in S.T.
No. 99/2005, but their intentions were to behead the sons of Dharat Singh. The appellants could not
get satisfaction by chopping of the head of Lakhan, but the same was taken away by them and was
thrown in forest area of Madagan Hill which was recovered on 20-5- 2006, Ex. P.21 i.e., after 36
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 28
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
days of the incident, on the confessional statements of Teerath, Ex. P.20, Hemraj, Ex.P. 22 and
Jagdish Ex.
P.23. From the examination of the head of Lakhan, it was found that various incised wounds were
caused on the head of Lakhan. Even the fingers of a 12 year old boy, Sonu, were chopped off. The
brutality shown by the appellants, clearly indicate that they were full of feeling of revenge and
accordingly, they acted in a such a brutal and ghastly manner. Thus, it is clear that old enmity
between the parties, provided motive to the appellants to commit the offence in a most brutal and
ghastly manner. The Supreme Court in the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri Vs. State of Bihar reported
in 1995 Supp (1) SCC 80 has held as under ;
21. At the very outset we may mention that sometimes motive plays an important role and becomes
a compelling force to commit a crime and therefore motive behind the crime is a relevant factor for
which evidence may be Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam
Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
526 of 2008) adduced. A motive is something which prompts a person to form an opinion or
intention to do certain illegal act or even a legal act but with illegal means with a view to achieve that
intention. In a case where there is clear proof of motive for the commission of the crime it affords
added support to the finding of the court that the accused was guilty of the offence charged with. But
it has to be remembered that the absence of proof of motive does not render the evidence bearing on
the guilt of the accused nonetheless untrustworthy or unreliable because most often it is only the
perpetrator of the crime alone who knows as to what circumstances prompted him to a certain
course of action leading to the commission of the crime.
The Supreme Court in the case of Bakshish Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in (2013) 2 SCC 187
has held as under :
40......When a high degree of animosity is established the existence of the motive may
be taken to be established.
80. Further, it is the case of the prosecution, that the deceased, injured and the
witnesses were coming to the Court in order to attend the date. This fact has not been
controverted by the appellants. Thus, it is clear that the presence of the witnesses on
the spot was natural.
Further, Rambabu is also an injured witness, therefore, his presence on the spot cannot be doubted.
Further, the defence witnesses, Kaluram (D.W.2) and Bhutilal (D.W.4) have not denied that the
prosecution witnesses were not present on the spot.
The Supreme Court in the case of Mohd. Ishaque v. State of W.B., reported in (2013) 14 SCC 581 has
held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 29
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
16......It is trite law that the testimony of injured witnesses is entitled to great weight
and it is unlikely that they would Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of
2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) spare the real
culprit and implicate an innocent person. Of course, there is no immutable rule of
appreciation of evidence that the evidence of injured witnesses should be
mechanically accepted, it should also be in consonance with probabilities (Ref:
Makan Jivan v. State of Gujarat, Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab, Jangir Singh v.
State of Punjab).
81. Whether the related witnesses are untrustworthy or not?
82. The Supreme Court in the case of Vijendra Singh v. State of U.P., reported in
(2017) 11 SCC 129 has held as under :
31. In this regard reference to a passage from Hari Obula Reddy v. State of A.P. would
be fruitful. In the said case, a three-Judge Bench has ruled that: (SCC pp. 683-84,
para 13) "[it cannot] be laid down as an invariable rule that interested evidence can
never form the basis of conviction unless corroborated to a material extent in
material particulars by independent evidence. All that is necessary is that the
evidence of the interested witnesses should be subjected to careful scrutiny and
accepted with caution. If on such scrutiny, the interested testimony is found to be
intrinsically reliable or inherently probable, it may, by itself, be sufficient, in the
circumstances of the particular case, to base a conviction thereon."
It is worthy to note that there is a distinction between a witness who is related and an interested
witness. A relative is a natural witness. The Court in Kartik Malhar v. State of Bihar has opined that
a close relative who is a natural witness cannot be regarded as an interested witness, for the term
"interested" postulates that the witness must have some interest in having the accused, somehow or
the other, convicted for some animus or for some other reason.
The Supreme Court in the case of Raju v. State of T.N., reported in (2012) 12 SCC 701 has held as
under :
20. The first contention relates to the credibility of PW 5 Srinivasan. It was said in
this regard that he was a related witness being the elder brother of Veerappan and the
son of Marudayi, both of whom were victims of the homicidal attack.
It was also said that he was an interested witness since Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008)
Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) Veerappan (and therefore PW 5
Srinivasan) had some enmity with the appellants. It was said that for both reasons, his testimony
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 30
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
lacks credibility.
21. What is the difference between a related witness and an interested witness? This has been
brought out in State of Rajasthan v. Kalki. It was held that: (SCC p. 754, para 7) "7. ... True, it is, she
is the wife of the deceased; but she cannot be called an 'interested' witness. She is related to the
deceased. 'Related' is not equivalent to 'interested'. A witness may be called 'interested' only when he
or she derives some benefit from the result of a litigation; in the decree in a civil case, or in seeing an
accused person punished. A witness who is a natural one and is the only possible eyewitness in the
circumstances of a case cannot be said to be 'interested'."
22. In light of the Constitution Bench decision in State of Bihar v. Basawan Singh, the view that a
"natural witness" or "the only possible eyewitness" cannot be an interested witness may not be, with
respect, correct. In Basawan Singh, a trap witness (who would be a natural eyewitness) was
considered an interested witness since he was "concerned in the success of the trap". The
Constitution Bench held: (AIR p. 506, para 15) "15. ... The correct rule is this: if any of the witnesses
are accomplices who are particeps criminis in respect of the actual crime charged, their evidence
must be treated as the evidence of accomplices is treated; if they are not accomplices but are
partisan or interested witnesses, who are concerned in the success of the trap, their evidence must
be tested in the same way as other interested evidence is tested by the application of diverse
considerations which must vary from case to case, and in a proper case, the court may even look for
independent corroboration before convicting the accused person."
23. The wife of a deceased (as in Kalki), undoubtedly related to the victim, would be interested in
seeing the accused person punished--in fact, she would be the most interested in seeing the accused
person punished. It can hardly be said that she is not an interested witness. The view expressed in
Kalki is too narrow and generalised and needs a rethink.
24. For the time being, we are concerned with four categories of witnesses--a third party
disinterested and unrelated witness (such as a bystander or passer-by); a third party interested
witness (such as a trap witness); a related and therefore an interested witness (such as the wife of
the victim) having an interest in seeing that the accused is punished; a related and Jagdish & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008)
Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) therefore an interested
witness (such as the wife or brother of the victim) having an interest in seeing the accused punished
and also having some enmity with the accused. But, more than the categorisation of a witness, the
issue really is one of appreciation of the evidence of a witness. A court should examine the evidence
of a related and interested witness having an interest in seeing the accused punished and also having
some enmity with the accused with greater care and caution than the evidence of a third party
disinterested and unrelated witness. This is all that is expected and required.
25. In the present case, PW 5 Srinivasan is not only a related and interested witness, but also
someone who has an enmity with the appellants. His evidence, therefore, needs to be scrutinised
with great care and caution.

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
26. In Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab this Court observed, without any generalisation, that a related
witness would ordinarily speak the truth, but in the case of an enmity there may be a tendency to
drag in an innocent person as an accused
--each case has to be considered on its own facts. This is what this Court had to say: (AIR p. 366,
para 26) "26. A witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from
sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause, such as
enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely. Ordinarily, a close relation would be the
last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run
high and there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person
against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a
criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of
truth. However, we are not attempting any sweeping generalisation. Each case must be judged on its
own facts. Our observations are only made to combat what is so often put forward in cases before us
as a general rule of prudence. There is no such general rule. Each case must be limited to and be
governed by its own facts."
27. How the evidence of such a witness should be looked at was again considered in Darya Singh v.
State of Punjab. This Court was of the opinion that a related or interested witness may not be hostile
to the assailant, but if he is, then his evidence must be examined very carefully and all the infirmities
taken into account. It was observed that where the witness shares the hostility of the victim against
the assailant, Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena
& Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of
2008) it would be unlikely that he would not name the real assailant but would substitute the real
assailant with the "enemy" of the victim. This is what this Court said: (AIR p. 331, para 6) "6. There
can be no doubt that in a murder case when evidence is given by near relatives of the victim and the
murder is alleged to have been committed by the enemy of the family, criminal courts must examine
the evidence of the interested witnesses, like the relatives of the victim, very carefully. But a person
may be interested in the victim, being his relation or otherwise, and may not necessarily be hostile to
the accused. In that case, the fact that the witness was related to the victim or was his friend, may
not necessarily introduce any infirmity in his evidence. But where the witness is a close relation of
the victim and is shown to share the victim's hostility to his assailant, that naturally makes it
necessary for the criminal courts to examine the evidence given by such witness very carefully and
scrutinise all the infirmities in that evidence before deciding to act upon it. ... [I]t may be relevant to
remember that though the witness is hostile to the assailant, it is not likely that he would
deliberately omit to name the real assailant and substitute in his place the name of the enemy of the
family out of malice. The desire to punish the victim would be so powerful in his mind that he would
unhesitatingly name the real assailant and would not think of substituting in his place the enemy of
the family though he was not concerned with the assault. It is not improbable that in giving
evidence, such a witness may name the real assailant and may add other persons out of malice and
enmity and that is a factor which has to be borne in mind in appreciating the evidence of interested
witnesses. On principle, however, it is difficult to accept the plea that if a witness is shown to be a
relative of the deceased and it is also shown that he shared the hostility of the victim towards the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 32
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
assailant, his evidence can never be accepted unless it is corroborated on material particulars."
28. More recently, in Waman v. State of Maharashtra this Court dealt with the case of a related
witness (though not a witness inimical to the assailant) and while referring to and relying upon
Sarwan Singh v. State of Punjab, Balraje v. State of Maharashtra, Prahalad Patel v. State of M.P.,
Israr v. State of U.P., S. Sudershan Reddy v. State of A.P., State of U.P. v. Naresh, Jarnail Singh v.
State of Punjab and Vishnu v. State of Rajasthan it was held: (Waman case SCC p. 302, para 20)
"20. It is clear that merely because the witnesses are related to the complainant or the deceased,
their evidence cannot be Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam
Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
526 of 2008) thrown out. If their evidence is found to be consistent and true, the fact of being a
relative cannot by itself discredit their evidence. In other words, the relationship is not a factor to
affect the credibility of a witness and the courts have to scrutinise their evidence meticulously with a
little care."
29. The sum and substance is that the evidence of a related or interested witness should be
meticulously and carefully examined. In a case where the related and interested witness may have
some enmity with the assailant, the bar would need to be raised and the evidence of the witness
would have to be examined by applying a standard of discerning scrutiny. However, this is only a
rule of prudence and not one of law, as held in Dalip Singh and pithily reiterated in Sarwan Singh in
the following words: (Sarwan Singh case, SCC p. 376, para
10) "10. ... The evidence of an interested witness does not suffer from any infirmity as such, but the
courts require as a rule of prudence, not as a rule of law, that the evidence of such witnesses should
be scrutinised with a little care. Once that approach is made and the court is satisfied that the
evidence of interested witnesses have a ring of truth such evidence could be relied upon even
without corroboration."
The Supreme Court in the case of Jodhan v. State of M.P., reported in (2015) 11 SCC 52 has held as
under :
24. First, we shall deal with the credibility of related witnesses.
In Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, it has been observed thus:
(AIR p. 366, para 25) "25. We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High
Court that the testimony of the two eyewitnesses requires corroboration. If the
foundation for such an observation is based on the fact that the witnesses are women
and that the fate of seven men hangs on their testimony, we know of no such rule. If it
is grounded on the reason that they are closely related to the deceased we are unable
to concur. This is a fallacy common to many criminal cases and one which another
Bench of this Court endeavoured to dispel in Rameshwar v. State of Rajasthan."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 33
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
In the said case, it has also been further observed: (AIR p. 366, para 26) "26. A witness is normally
to be considered independent unless Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008)
Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of
2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) he or she springs from sources which are likely to be tainted and
that usually means unless the witness has cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to
implicate him falsely. Ordinarily a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and
falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and there is personal cause
for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a
grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of
relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth."
25. In Hari Obula Reddy v. State of A.P., the Court has ruled that evidence of interested witnesses
per se cannot be said to be unreliable evidence. Partisanship by itself is not a valid ground for
discrediting or discarding sole testimony. We may fruitfully reproduce a passage from the said
authority: (SCC pp. 683-84, para 13) "13. ... an invariable rule that interested evidence can never
form the basis of conviction unless corroborated to a material extent in material particulars by
independent evidence. All that is necessary is that the evidence of interested witnesses should be
subjected to careful scrutiny and accepted with caution. If on such scrutiny, the interested testimony
is found to be intrinsically reliable or inherently probable, it may, by itself, be sufficient, in the
circumstances of the particular case, to base a conviction thereon."
26. The principles that have been stated in number of decisions are to the effect that evidence of an
interested witness can be relied upon if it is found to be trustworthy and credible. Needless to say, a
testimony, if after careful scrutiny is found as unreliable and improbable or suspicious it ought to be
rejected. That apart, when a witness has a motive or makes false implication, the court before
relying upon his testimony should seek corroboration in regard to material particulars.
The Supreme Court in the case of Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh, reported in (2017) 11 SCC 195
has held as under :
24. On the issue of appreciation of evidence of interested witnesses, Dalip Singh v.
State of Punjab is one of the earliest cases on the point. In that case, it was held as
follows: (AIR p.
366, para 26) Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena
& Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of
2008) "26. A witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs from
sources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has cause, such as
enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely. Ordinarily, a close relative would be the
last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of
truth."
25. Similarly, in Piara Singh v. State of Punjab, this Court held: (SCC p. 455, para 4) "4. ... It is well
settled that the evidence of interested or inimical witnesses is to be scrutinised with care but cannot
be rejected merely on the ground of being a partisan evidence. If on a perusal of the evidence the
Court is satisfied that the evidence is creditworthy there is no bar in the Court relying on the said
evidence."
26. In Hari Obula Reddy v. State of A.P., a three-Judge Bench of this Court observed: (SCC pp.
683-84, para 13) "13. ... it is well settled that interested evidence is not necessarily unreliable
evidence. Even partisanship by itself is not a valid ground for discrediting or rejecting sworn
testimony. Nor can it be laid down as an invariable rule that interested evidence can never form the
basis of conviction unless corroborated to a material extent in material particulars by independent
evidence. All that is necessary is that the evidence of interested witnesses should be subjected to
careful scrutiny and accepted with caution. If on such scrutiny, the interested testimony is found to
be intrinsically reliable or inherently probable, it may, by itself, be sufficient, in the circumstances of
the particular case, to base a conviction thereon."
27. Again, in Ramashish Rai v. Jagdish Singh, the following observations were made by this Court:
(SCC p. 501, para 7) "7. ... The requirement of law is that the testimony of inimical witnesses has to
be considered with caution. If otherwise the witnesses are true and reliable their testimony cannot
be thrown out on the threshold by branding them as inimical witnesses. By now, it is well-settled
principle of law that enmity is a double-edged sword. It can be a ground for false Jagdish & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008)
Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) implication. It also can be
a ground for assault. Therefore, a duty is cast upon the court to examine the testimony of inimical
witnesses with due caution and diligence."
28. A survey of the judicial pronouncements of this Court on this point leads to the inescapable
conclusion that the evidence of a closely related witness is required to be carefully scrutinised and
appreciated before any conclusion is made to rest upon it, regarding the convict/accused in a given
case. Thus, the evidence cannot be disbelieved merely on the ground that the witnesses are related
to each other or to the deceased. In case the evidence has a ring of truth to it, is cogent, credible and
trustworthy, it can, and certainly should, be relied upon. (See Anil Rai v. State of Bihar, State of U.P.
v. Jagdeo, Bhagaloo Lodh v. State of U.P., Dahari v. State of U.P., Raju v. State of T.N.,
Gangabhavani v. Rayapati Venkat Reddy and Jodhan v. State of M.P.) The Supreme Court in the
case of Mohd. Aslam Vs. State of U.P. reported in (1993) 3 SCC 10 has held as under :
6......The mere fact that there was enmity and bitterness between the two groups, by
itself, does not establish that the eyewitnesses falsely implicated the
accused/appellant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 35
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
83. Thus, it is clear that the evidence of a witness cannot be thrown overboard only
on the ground that he is related witness, however, his evidence is liable to be
scrutinized carefully and if his evidence is found trustworthy, then he should be
relied upon.
84. It is true that most of the witnesses were facing trial for committing murder of
Ramcharan and most of the appellants were witnesses in the said Trial, but the
manner in which the deceased persons were killed, that clearly shows that the
gruesome and ghastly act was done with a solitary intention to take revenge. Further,
all the witnesses were going to Court to attend the Court proceedings.
Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) Therefore,
their presence on the spot is also not doubtful. Further, the F.I.R. was lodged within 30 minutes of
the incident. Two persons including one minor boy aged about 12 years, were brutally murder by the
accused persons in the presence of the witnesses. Both the deceased were beheaded. The witnesses
after witnessing the incident, rushed back to their village, in order to save their lives.
Thereafter, they came back and took the dead bodies as well as the injured Rambabu (P.W.3) to the
police station on the tractor trolley and lodged the F.I.R. within 30 days. Thus, it is clear that the
witnesses did not have any time to cook up a false story. The promptness in lodging the F.I.R.,
indicates that the same was not lodged after any deliberation. The Supreme Court in the case of Sat
Kumar Vs. State of Haryana reported in (1974) 3 SCC 643 has held as under :
9.........The fact that Suraj Bhan has lodged the first information report within half an
hour at a place twelve miles away from Uchana travelling in truck leaves no
possibility for any concoction of a false case against any of the accused persons.
The Supreme Court in the case of Krishnan Vs. State reported in (2003) 7 SCC 56 has held as under ;
17. The fact that the first information report was given almost immediately, rules out any possibility
of deliberation to falsely implicate any person.
85. Now the next question for consideration is that whether the Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008)
Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) evidence collected against the appellants is
sufficient to hold them guilty or not and whether they had constituted Unlawful Assembly and were
sharing common object or not?
86. Before considering the allegations made against the appellants, this Court think it apposite to
consider the law governing the field of Unlawful Assembly and Common Object.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 36
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
87. The Supreme Court in the case of Bhagwan Jagannath Markad v. State of Maharashtra,reported
in (2016) 10 SCC 537 has held as under :
21. An offence committed in prosecution of common object of an unlawful assembly
by one person renders members of unlawful assembly sharing the common object
vicariously liable for the offence. The common object has to be ascertained from the
acts and language of the members of the assembly and all the surrounding
circumstances. It can be gathered from the course of conduct of the members. It is to
be assessed keeping in view the nature of the assembly, arms carried by the members
and the behaviour of the members at or near the scene of incident. Sharing of
common object is a mental attitude which is to be gathered from the act of a person
and result thereof. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to when common object
can be inferred. When a crowd of assailants are members of an unlawful assembly, it
may not be possible for witnesses to accurately describe the part played by each one
of the assailants. It may not be necessary that all members take part in the actual
assault. In Gangadhar Behera, this Court observed: (SCC pp. 398-99, para 25) "25.
The other plea that definite roles have not been ascribed to the accused and therefore
Section 149 is not applicable, is untenable. A four-Judge Bench of this Court in
Masalti case observed as follows: (AIR p. 210, para 15) '15. Then it is urged that the
evidence given by the witnesses conforms to the same uniform pattern and since no
specific part is assigned to all the assailants, that Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008)
Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526
of 2008) evidence should not have been accepted. This criticism again is not well
founded. Where a crowd of assailants who are members of an unlawful assembly
proceeds to commit an offence of murder in pursuance of the common object of the
unlawful assembly, it is often not possible for witnesses to describe accurately the
part played by each one of the assailants. Besides, if a large crowd of persons armed
with weapons assaults the intended victims, it may not be necessary that all of them
have to take part in the actual assault. In the present case, for instance, several
weapons were carried by different members of the unlawful assembly, but it appears
that the guns were used and that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a case, it
would be unreasonable to contend that because the other weapons carried by the
members of the unlawful assembly were not used, the story in regard to the said
weapons itself should be rejected.
Appreciation of evidence in such a complex case is no doubt a difficult task; but criminal courts have
to do their best in dealing with such cases and it is their duty to sift the evidence carefully and decide
which part of it is true and which is not.'"
88. The Supreme Court in the case of Vinubhai Ranchhodbhai Patel v. Rajivbhai Dudabhai Patel,
reported in (2018) 7 SCC 743 has held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 37
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
24. To understand the true scope and amplitude of Section 149 IPC it is necessary to
examine the scheme of Chapter VIII (Sections 141 to 160) IPC which is titled "Of the
offences against the public tranquility". Sections 141 to 158 deal with offences
committed collectively by a group of 5 or more individuals.
25. Section 141 IPC declares an assembly of five or more persons to be an "unlawful
assembly" if the common object of such assembly is to achieve any one of the five
objects enumerated in the said section. One of the enumerated objects is to commit
any offence. "The words falling under Section 141, clause third "or other offence"
cannot be restricted to mean only minor offences of trespass or mischief. These
words cover all offences falling under any of the provisions of the Penal Code or any
other law." The mere assembly of 5 or more persons with such legally Jagdish & Anr
Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena
& Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) impermissible object itself constitutes the offence of unlawful
assembly punishable under Section 143 IPC. It is not necessary that any overt act is
required to be committed by such an assembly to be punished under Section 143.
26. If force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or any member thereof in
prosecution of the common objective of such assembly, every member of such
assembly is declared under Section 146 to be guilty of the offence of rioting
punishable with two years' imprisonment under Section 147. To constitute the
offence of rioting under Section 146, the use of force or violence need not necessarily
result in the achievement of the common object.
In other words, the employment of force or violence need not result in the commission of a crime or
the achievement of any one of the five enumerated common objects under Section 141.
27. Section 148 declares that rioting armed with deadly weapons is a distinct offence punishable
with the longer period of imprisonment (three years). There is a distinction between the offences
under Sections 146 and 148. To constitute an offence under Section 146, the members of the
"unlawful assembly" need not carry weapons. But to constitute an offence under Section 148, a
person must be a member of an unlawful assembly, such assembly is also guilty of the offence of
rioting under Section 146 and the person charged with an offence under Section 148 must also be
armed with a deadly weapon.
28. Section 149 propounds a vicarious liability in two contingencies by declaring that (i) if a member
of an unlawful assembly commits an offence in prosecution of the common object of that assembly,
then every member of such unlawful assembly is guilty of the offence committed by the other
members of the unlawful assembly, and (ii) even in cases where all the members of the unlawful
assembly do not share the same common object to commit a particular offence, if they had the
knowledge of the fact that some of the other members of the assembly are likely to commit that
particular offence in prosecution of the common object.

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
29. The scope of Section 149 IPC was enunciated by this Court in Masalti: (AIR p. 211, para 17) "17.
... The crucial question to determine in such a case is whether the assembly consisted of five or more
persons and Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena
& Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of
2008) whether the said persons entertained one or more of the common objects as specified by
Section 141. While determining this question, it becomes relevant to consider whether the assembly
consisted of some persons who were merely passive witnesses and had joined the assembly as a
matter of idle curiosity without intending to entertain the common object of the assembly. It is in
that context that the observations made by this Court in Baladin assume significance; otherwise, in
law, it would not be correct to say that before a person is held to be a member of an unlawful
assembly, it must be shown that he had committed some illegal overt act or had been guilty of some
illegal omission in pursuance of the common object of the assembly. In fact, Section 149 makes it
clear that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the
common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be
committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that
offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence; and that emphatically brings out
the principle that the punishment prescribed by Section 149 is in a sense vicarious and does not
always proceed on the basis that the offence has been actually committed by every member of the
unlawful assembly."
30. It can be seen from the above, Sections 141, 146 and 148 create distinct offences. Section 149
only creates a vicarious liability. However, Sections 146, 148 and 149 contain certain legislative
declarations based on the doctrine of vicarious liability. The doctrine is well known in civil law
especially in the branch of torts, but is applied very sparingly in criminal law only when there is a
clear legislative command. To be liable for punishment under any one of the provisions, the
fundamental requirement is the existence of an unlawful assembly as defined under Section 141
made punishable under Section 143 IPC.
31. The concept of an unlawful assembly as can be seen from Section 141 has two elements:
(i) The assembly should consist of at least five persons; and
(ii) They should have a common object to commit an offence or achieve any one of
the objects enumerated therein.
32. For recording a conclusion, that a person is (i) guilty of Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008)
Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) any one of the offences under Sections 143,
146 or 148 or
(ii) vicariously liable under Section 149 for some other offence, it must first be proved that such
person is a member of an "unlawful assembly" consisting of not less than five persons irrespective of

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
the fact whether the identity of each one of the 5 persons is proved or not. If that fact is proved, the
next step of inquiry is whether the common object of the unlawful assembly is one of the 5
enumerated objects specified under Section 141 IPC.
33. The common object of assembly is normally to be gathered from the circumstances of each case
such as the time and place of the gathering of the assembly, the conduct of the gathering as
distinguished from the conduct of the individual members are indicative of the common object of
the gathering. Assessing the common object of an assembly only on the basis of the overt acts
committed by such individual members of the assembly, in our opinion is impermissible. For
example, if more than five people gather together and attack another person with deadly weapons
eventually resulting in the death of the victim, it is wrong to conclude that one or some of the
members of such assembly did not share the common object with those who had inflicted the fatal
injuries (as proved by medical evidence); merely on the ground that the injuries inflicted by such
members are relatively less serious and non-fatal.
34. For mulcting liability on the members of an unlawful assembly under Section 149, it is not
necessary that every member of the unlawful assembly should commit the offence in prosecution of
the common object of the assembly. Mere knowledge of the likelihood of commission of such an
offence by the members of the assembly is sufficient. For example, if five or more members carrying
AK 47 rifles collectively attack a victim and cause his death by gunshot injuries, the fact that one or
two of the members of the assembly did not in fact fire their weapons does not mean that they did
not have the knowledge of the fact that the offence of murder is likely to be committed.
35. The identification of the common object essentially requires an assessment of the state of mind
of the members of the unlawful assembly. Proof of such mental condition is normally established by
inferential logic. If a large number of people gather at a public place at the dead of night armed with
deadly weapons like axes and firearms and attack another person or group of persons, any member
of the Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena &
Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of
2008) attacking group would have to be a moron in intelligence if he did not know murder would be
a likely consequence.
89. The Supreme Court in the case of Mahendran v. State of T.N., reported in (2019) 5 SCC 67 has
held as under :
51. In Gangadhar Behera case, while considering Section 141 IPC, it was held that
common object is not common intention as the mere presence in an unlawful
assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common object and he was
actuated by that common object. Common object does not require a prior concert and
a common meeting of minds before the attack. It is enough if each has the same
object in view if the five or more act as an assembly to achieve that object. The
"common object" of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of
the members composing it, and from a consideration of all the surrounding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 40
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
circumstances. The Court while considering the plea that definite roles ascribed to
the accused and therefore Section 149 is not applicable was not accepted. It is held as
under: (SCC pp. 398-99, paras 25-28) "25. The other plea that definite roles have not
been ascribed to the accused and therefore Section 149 is not applicable, is untenable.
A four-Judge Bench of this Court in Masalti case observed as follows: (AIR p. 210,
para 15) "15. Then it is urged that the evidence given by the witnesses conforms to the
same uniform pattern and since no specific part is assigned to all the assailants, that
evidence should not have been accepted. This criticism again is not well founded.
Where a crowd of assailants who are members of an unlawful assembly proceeds to
commit an offence of murder in pursuance of the common object of the unlawful
assembly, it is often not possible for witnesses to describe accurately the part played
by each one of the assailants. Besides, if a large crowd of persons armed with
weapons assaults the intended victims, it may not be necessary that all of them have
to take part in the actual assault. In the present case, for instance, several weapons
were carried by different members of the unlawful assembly, but it appears that the
guns were used and that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a case, it would be
unreasonable to contend that because the other weapons carried by the members of
the unlawful assembly were not used, the story Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath
Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) in
regard to the said weapons itself should be rejected.
Appreciation of evidence in such a complex case is no doubt a difficult task; but criminal courts have
to do their best in dealing with such cases and it is their duty to sift the evidence carefully and decide
which part of it is true and which is not."
26. To similar effect is the observation in Lalji v. State of U.P. It was observed that: (SCC p. 441, para
8) "8. ... Common object of the unlawful assembly can be gathered from the nature of the assembly,
arms used by them and the behaviour of the assembly at or before the scene of occurrence. It is an
inference to be deduced from the facts and circumstances of each case."
27. In State of U.P. v. Dan Singh it was observed that it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove
which of the members of the unlawful assembly did which or what act. Reference was made to Lalji
case where it was observed that: (SCC p. 442, para 9) "9. ... While overt act and active participation
may indicate common intention of the person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the
unlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminal liability under Section 149."
28. Above being the position, we find no substance in the plea that evidence of eyewitnesses is not
sufficient to fasten guilt by application of Section 149. So far as the observations made in Kamaksha
Rai case are concerned, it is to be noted that the decision in the said case was rendered in a different
factual scenario altogether. There is always peril in treating the words of a judgment as though they
are words in a legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in
the setting of the facts of a particular case. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases (see Padma Sundara Rao v. State
of T.N.). It is more so in a case where conclusions relate to appreciation of evidence in a criminal
trial, as was observed in Krishna Mochi case."
90. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellants, that in the F.I.R., Ex. P.3, although in the
column of names of accused, the names of all the appellants were mentioned, but in the body of the
Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) F.I.R.,
specific roles were assigned to Radheshyam, Randhir, Jitendra, Kamlesh, Teerath Meena,
Rameshwar, Ghasilal, Pritam, Hemraj Meena, Jagdish, Satish, Ramdayal and absconding accused
Badri only. It is submitted that it is clear that Raghuvir has been falsely implicated.
91. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants.
92. S.S. Tomar (P.W.19) has recorded the F.I.R., Ex. P.3. No question was put to him to the effect
that when the name of Raghuvir was not in the body of the F.I.R. then why his name was mentioned
in the column of accused persons? S.S. Tomar (P.W.19) has specifically stated that a mob had come
to the Police Station. This witness was in the best position to clarify that even in absence of name of
Raghuvir in the body of F.I.R., why the name of Raghuvir was mentioned in the column of names of
accused persons. Thus, it is clear that the complainant Raghuvir Singh (P.W.2) must have disclosed
the name of Raghuvir in the F.I.R., Ex. P.3. Further more, F.I.R. is not an encyclopaedia. Each and
every minute detail is not required to be disclosed in the F.I.R. The Supreme Court in the case of
Motiram Padu Joshi Vs. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2018) 9 SCC 429 has held as under :
14. Furthermore, as pointed out by the High Court, FIR is not an encyclopaedia which
should contain all the details of Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of
2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.
471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) the incident.
FIR is not an encyclopaedia which is expected to contain all the details of the
prosecution case. It may be sufficient if the broad facts of the prosecution case about
the occurrence appear. Omission as to the names of the assailants or the witnesses
may not all the times be fatal to the prosecution, if the FIR is lodged without delay.
Unless there are indications of fabrication, the court cannot reject the prosecution
case as given in the FIR merely because of omission. In the present case, FIR was
registered without delay and prompt registration of FIR itself lends assurance to the
prosecution case. The object of the FIR is to set the law in motion. Omission to give
the names of assailants or the names of witnesses in the FIR is not fatal to the
prosecution case. The High Court was right in observing that non-mention of the
names of eyewitnesses in the FIR can hardly be fatal to the prosecution case.
93. Thus, merely because no role was assigned to Raghuvir in the F.I.R., Ex. P.3, this
Court is of the considered opinion, that the evidence of the witnesses against
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 42
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
Raghuvir cannot be discarded only on this ground.
94. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellants, that at every step, the
witnesses have assigned different roles to the appellants, and their evidence is not
consistent so far as the role played by each and every appellant, therefore, the
evidence of prosecution witnesses is not reliable, and the prosecution has failed to
prove that the appellants were the members of Unlawful Assembly or they had acted
in furtherance of common object.
95. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants.
96. In the present case, 14 accused persons (13 Appellants and Jagdish & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461
of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena &
Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 526 of 2008) Badri (Absconding), by surrounding the deceased and injured
witness, had committed the offence in a most ghastly manner. Both the deceased
persons were beheaded and multiple injuries were caused to them, which is evident
from the post-mortem reports of Lakhan, Ex. P. 43 and of Sonu, Ex. P.45. From the
Examination Report of head of Lakhan, Ex. P.85, it is clear that multiple injuries
were caused on the head of Lakhan before beheading him. Under these
circumstances, minor variations in the evidence of the witnesses, with regard to the
role played by each and every appellant, would not give any dent to the prosecution.
On the contrary, it indicates, that the witnesses have not deposed after consulting
each other and they are not tutored witnesses. Further, the defence witness Kaluram
(D.W.2) and Bhutilal (D.W 4) have stated about the presence of atleast 5 appellants
on the spot. The Supreme Court in the case of Rohtas Vs. State of Haryana reported
in (2019) 10 SCC 554 has held as under ;
26. In a recent decision in Dilawar Singh v. State of Haryana, the Court restated that
while analysing the evidence of eyewitnesses, it must be borne in mind that there is
bound to be variations and difference in the behaviour of the witnesses or their
reactions from situation to situation and individual to individual. There cannot be
uniformity in the reaction of witnesses. The Court must not decipher the evidence on
unrealistic basis. There can be no hard-and-fast rule about the uniformity in human
reaction.
The difference in the statements of the prosecution witnesses about the conditions of Mohar Pal
when he was admitted in the hospital, therefore, does not take the matter Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of
M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of
2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) any further especially when the
medical reports clearly indicate that he was admitted in the hospital in semi- conscious state and
was declared dead by the doctor only thereafter.

Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
97. The Supreme Court in the case of Sukhdev Yadav Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2001) 8 SCC 86
has held as under :
1. It is now well settled that the court can sift the chaff from the grain and find out the
truth from the testimony of the witnesses. The evidence is to be considered from the
point of view of trustworthiness and once the same stands satisfied, it ought to
inspire confidence in the mind of the court to accept the stated evidence. This Court
in Leela Ram v. State of Haryana relying upon an earlier decision of this Court in
State of U.P. v. M.K. Anthony observed: (SCC p. 532, para 9) "There are bound to be
some discrepancies between the narrations of different witnesses when they speak on
details, and unless the contradictions are of a material dimension, the same should
not be used to jettison the evidence in its entirety. Incidentally, corroboration of
evidence with mathematical niceties cannot be expected in criminal cases. Minor
embellishment, there may be, but variations by reason therefor should not render the
evidence of eyewitnesses unbelievable. Trivial discrepancies ought not to obliterate
an otherwise acceptable evidence."
98. Thus, where the F.I.R. was lodged within 30 minutes, and the names of all the appellants were
mentioned in the F.I.R., and the ocular evidence is corroborated by the Medical Evidence as well as
Forensic Evidence, then it is clear that minor discrepancies in the testimonies of the witnesses
would not make the prosecution story untrustworthy or unreliable. Thus, in view of the impeccable
evidence available on record, it is held that all the appellants had Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008)
Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) participated in the commission of brutal
murder of Lakhan and Sonu as well as in making an attempt to murder Rambabu (P.W.3). They all
were not only present on the spot, but the number of injuries found on the bodies of the deceased
Lakhan and Sonu, it is held that the presence of each and every appellant on the spot was in
furtherance of common object and all of them were the members of Unlawful Assembly.
99. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellants that the swords or lathis seized from some
of the appellants were not having any blood stains, therefore, it is clear that the appellants are
innocent persons.
100. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants.
101. The dates of arrest of appellants have already been mentioned in para 26 of this judgment. Thus
it is clear that although the incident had taken place on 12-4-2006, but the accused persons were
arrested after two weeks thereafter. Thus, every appellant had ample opportunity to either wash out
their weapons, or to ensure that the weapon used by them in the offence is not handed over to the
police.
At the most, it can be said that the weapon of offence i.e., swords and lathis, luhangi were not seized.
Mere non-recovery of weapon of offence would not make the prosecution case false. The Supreme

the case of Krishna Gope Vs. State of Bihar reported in (2003) 10 SCC 45 has held as under ;
8. Learned counsel further pointed out that the country- made firearm alleged to have been used by
the appellant was not recovered by the police and the same was not sent to the police station. The
learned counsel submitted that the investigation was not properly done and that the appellant is
entitled to the benefit of doubt. In our view, this plea is not tenable. The house of the appellant was
searched immediately after the incident, but the police could not recover the weapon of offence from
his house. It appears that the appellant had succeeded in concealing the weapon before the police
could search his house. In our opinion, the fact of non-recovery of the weapon from the house of the
appellant does not enure to his benefit.
(Underline supplied)
102. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellants, that the Trial Court had come to a conclusion
that the co-accused Vishal was not present on the spot and has acquitted him, therefore, it is clear
that the witnesses have tried to over implicate the innocent person(s). It is further submitted that in
the F.I.R., Ex. P.3, the names of Vishnu, Gopal and Asgar Khan were also mentioned, but thereafter,
the prosecution witnesses, disowned the said part of their information, and claimed that the above
three accused persons were not present on the spot. Thus, it is submitted that the prosecution
witnesses have adopted the policy of pick and choose.
103. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the appellants.
104. The Latin Maxim Falsus in uno, Falsus in omnibus has no Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P.

the case of Shakila Abdul Gafar Khan v. Vasant Raghunath Dhoble, reported in (2003) 7 SCC 749
has held as under :
25. It is the duty of the court to separate the grain from the chaff. Falsity of a
particular material witness or a material particular would not ruin it from the
beginning to end. The maxim "falsus in uno falsus in omnibus" has no application in
India and the witnesses cannot be branded as liars. The maxim "falsus in uno falsus
in omnibus" has not received general acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy
the status of rule of law. It is merely a rule of caution. All that it amounts to is that in
such cases testimony may be disregarded, and not that it must be disregarded. The
doctrine merely involves the question of weight of evidence which a court may apply
in a given set of circumstances, but it is not what may be called "a mandatory rule of
evidence". (See Nisar Ali v. State of U.P.)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 45
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
26. The doctrine is a dangerous one especially in India for if a whole body of the
testimony were to be rejected, because the witness was evidently speaking an untruth
in some aspect, it is to be feared that administration of criminal justice would come
to a dead stop. Witnesses just cannot help in giving embroidery to a story, however
true in the main. Therefore, it has to be appraised in each case as to what extent the
evidence is worthy of acceptance, and merely because in some respects the court
considers the same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the testimony of a
witness, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be disregarded
in all respects as well. The evidence has to be sifted with care. The aforesaid dictum is
not a sound rule for the reason that one hardly comes across a witness whose
evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or at any rate an exaggeration,
embroideries or embellishment. (See Sohrab v. State of M.P. and Ugar Ahir v. State of
Bihar.) An attempt has to be made to, as noted above, in terms of felicitous metaphor,
separate the grain from the chaff, truth from falsehood. Where it is not feasible to
separate the truth from falsehood, because grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up,
and in the process of separation an absolutely new case has to be reconstructed by
divorcing essential details presented by the prosecution completely Jagdish & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461

Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A.
No. 526 of 2008) from the context and the background against which they are made,
the only available course to be made is to discard the evidence in toto. (See Zwinglee
Ariel v. State of M.P. and Balaka Singh v. State of Punjab.) As observed by this Court
in State of Rajasthan v. Kalki normal discrepancies in the evidence are those which
are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of
time, due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence
and those are always there, however honest and truthful a witness may be. Material
discrepancies are those which are not normal, and not expected of a normal person.
Courts have to label the category to which a discrepancy may be categorized. While
normal discrepancies do not corrode the credibility of a party's case, material
discrepancies do so. These aspects were highlighted recently in Krishna Mochi v.
State of Bihar, Gangadhar Behera v. State of Orissa and Rizan v. State of
Chhattisgarh.
105. It is next contended by the Counsel for the appellants that the Trial Court has wrongly rejected
the evidence of Defence witnesses.

incident was committed by five person. It is stated that Radheshyam and his three sons have
committed the offence.
111. Puranlal (D.W. 6) has been examined to prove plea of alibi of Randhir.
112. It is well established principle of law that plea of alibi has to be proved beyond reasonable
doubt.
113. The Supreme Court in the case of Vijay Pal v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), reported in (2015) 4
SCC 749 has held as under :
25. At this juncture, we think it apt to deal with the plea of alibi that has been put
forth by the appellant. As is demonstrable, the trial court has discarded the plea of
alibi.
When a plea of alibi is taken by an accused, burden is upon him to establish the same by positive
evidence after onus as regards presence on the spot is established by the prosecution. In this
context, we may profitably reproduce a few paragraphs from Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar:
(SCC p. 293, paras 22-23) "22. We must bear in mind that an alibi is not an exception
(special or general) envisaged in the Penal Code, 1860 or any other law. It is only a
rule of evidence recognised in Section 11 of the Evidence Act that facts which are
inconsistent with the fact in issue are relevant. Illustration
(a) given under the provision is worth reproducing in this context:
'(a) The question is whether A committed a crime at Calcutta on a certain day. The
fact that, on that date, A was at Lahore is relevant.'
23. The Latin word alibi means 'elsewhere' and that word is used for convenience
when an accused takes recourse to a defence line that when the occurrence took place
he was so far away from the place of occurrence that it is extremely improbable that
he would have participated in the crime. It is a basic law that in a criminal case, in
which the accused is alleged to have inflicted physical injury to another Jagdish &

M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) person, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that
the accused was present at the scene and has participated in the crime. The burden
would not be lessened by the mere fact that the accused has adopted the defence of
alibi. The plea of the accused in such cases need be considered only when the burden
has been discharged by the prosecution satisfactorily. But once the prosecution
succeeds in discharging the burden it is incumbent on the accused, who adopts the
plea of alibi, to prove it with absolute certainty so as to exclude the possibility of his
presence at the place of occurrence. When the presence of the accused at the scene of
occurrence has been established satisfactorily by the prosecution through reliable
evidence, normally the court would be slow to believe any counter-evidence to the
effect that he was elsewhere when the occurrence happened. But if the evidence
adduced by the accused is of such a quality and of such a standard that the court may
entertain some reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the scene when the
occurrence took place, the accused would, no doubt, be entitled to the benefit of that
reasonable doubt. For that purpose, it would be a sound proposition to be laid down
that, in such circumstances, the burden on the accused is rather heavy. It follows,
therefore, that strict proof is required for establishing the plea of alibi."
(emphasis supplied) The said principle has been reiterated in Gurpreet Singh v. State of Haryana,
Sk. Sattar v. State of Maharashtra and Jitender Kumar v. State of Haryana.
The Supreme Court in the case of Sk. Sattar v. State of Maharashtra, reported in (2010) 8 SCC 430
has held as under :
35. Undoubtedly, the burden of establishing the plea of alibi lay upon the appellant.
The appellant herein has miserably failed to bring on record any facts or
circumstances which would make the plea of his absence even probable, let alone,
being proved beyond reasonable doubt. The plea of alibi had to be proved with
absolute certainty so as to completely exclude the possibility of the presence of the
appellant in the rented premises at the relevant time. When a plea of alibi is raised by
an accused it is for the accused to establish the said plea by positive evidence which
has not Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs.
State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of
2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir &
Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) been led in the present case. We may
also notice here at this stage the proposition of law laid down in Gurpreet Singh v.
State of Haryana as follows: (SCC p. 27, para 20) "20. ... This plea of alibi stands
disbelieved by both the courts and since the plea of alibi is a question of fact and
since both the courts concurrently found that fact against the appellant, the accused,
this Court in our view, cannot on an appeal by special leave go behind the abovenoted
concurrent finding of fact."
36. But it is also correct that, even though the plea of alibi of the appellant is not
established, it was for the prosecution to prove the case against the appellant. To this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 48
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
extent, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant was correct. The
failure of the plea of alibi would not necessarily lead to the success of the prosecution
case which has to be independently proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable
doubt. Being aware of the aforesaid principle of law, the trial court as also the High
Court examined the circumstantial evidence to exclude the possibility of the
innocence of the appellant.
The Supreme Court in the case of Binay Kumar Singh v.
State of Bihar, reported in (1997) 1 SCC 283 has held as under:
22. We must bear in mind that an alibi is not an exception (special or general)
envisaged in the Indian Penal Code or any other law. It is only a rule of evidence
recognised in Section 11 of the Evidence Act that facts which are inconsistent with the
fact in issue are relevant. Illustration
(a) given under the provision is worth reproducing in this context:
"The question is whether A committed a crime at Calcutta on a certain date; the fact
that on that date, A was at Lahore is relevant."
23. The Latin word alibi means "elsewhere" and that word is used for convenience when an accused
takes recourse to a defence line that when the occurrence took place he was so far away from the
place of occurrence that it is extremely improbable that he would have participated in the crime. It is
a basic law that in a criminal case, in which the accused is alleged to have inflicted physical injury to
another person, the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused Jagdish & Anr Vs. State
of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath
Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 471
of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) was present at the scene and has
participated in the crime. The burden would not be lessened by the mere fact that the accused has
adopted the defence of alibi. The plea of the accused in such cases need be considered only when the
burden has been discharged by the prosecution satisfactorily. But once the prosecution succeeds in
discharging the burden it is incumbent on the accused, who adopts the plea of alibi, to prove it with
absolute certainty so as to exclude the possibility of his presence at the place of occurrence. When
the presence of the accused at the scene of occurrence has been established satisfactorily by the
prosecution through reliable evidence, normally the court would be slow to believe any
counter-evidence to the effect that he was elsewhere when the occurrence happened. But if the
evidence adduced by the accused is of such a quality and of such a standard that the court may
entertain some reasonable doubt regarding his presence at the scene when the occurrence took
place, the accused would, no doubt, be entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt. For that
purpose, it would be a sound proposition to be laid down that, in such circumstances, the burden on
the accused is rather heavy. It follows, therefore, that strict proof is required for establishing the
plea of alibi. This Court has observed so on earlier occasions (vide Dudh Nath Pandey v. State of
U.P.; State of Maharashtra v. Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 49
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
114. Thus, the burden to prove the plea of alibi is heavy on the accused and the plea of alibi cannot
be proved by preponderance of probabilities.
Jai Kumar Jain (D.W.1)
115. The incident in question took place at 10:00 A.M. This witness has stated that he had seen
Ghasilal in the school. In para 4 of his cross-examination, this witness has admitted that he reached
School at 12:00 P.M. Thus, from the evidence of this witness, it can not be held that the appellant
Ghasilal could not have been on spot at 10:00 Jagdish & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of
2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of 2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No.

Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) A.M. Further, this witness has proved a certificate issued
by Head Master regarding the presence of Ghasilal as Ex. D.9. Undisputedly, this witness has not
executed the said document, and the appellant Ghasilal has not examined Head Master who had
issued the certificate, Ex. D.9. Further, the School in which Ghasilal was a teacher is situated in
Kumbhraj, and the place of incident is only 4 Kms away from Kumbhraj, as is evident from F.I.R. Ex
P.3, as the distance of police station Kumbhraj is only 4 Km. Further one Dolchi (an utensil) was
also recovered from a place near about 1 Km away from the place of incident which had the name of
the appellant Ghasilal engraved on it. Thus, it is clear that one utensil of appellant Ghasilal was also
found from a place nearer to the place of incident.
Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion, that this witness has failed to prove that the appellant
Ghasilal was in the school at the time of incident.
Kaluram (D.W.2)
116. This witness has claimed himself to be an eye-witness of the incident. He has stated that Sonu
was killed by Appellant Radheshyam, Teerath and Hemraj and all other appellants were not there.
This witness has expressed his ignorance about the murder of Lakhan. He also admitted that he is
on visiting terms with the appellants.

(D.W.4)
117. This witness has stated that the incident was committed by Appellant Radheshyam, his three
sons and one more person i.e., his brother (as mentioned in para 5). Thus, there is a discrepancy
with regard to number of assailants. Further, this witness has claimed that only one person had died
and he had not seen any incident with Sonu.
He has further admitted that Sonu had died near his house, but claimed that he could not see the
assailants. Thus, it is clear that this witness is not narrating the complete truth. When this witness
can watch an incident which took place at a distance of 40-50 ft away from his house in which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/41201524/ 50
Randhir vs State Of M.P. on 3 August, 2021
Lakhan lost his life, then how it is possible that this witness would not be in a position to witness the
assault on Sonu, which took place quite nearer to his house. This witness has further admitted that
the appellants are in habit of creating terror in the locality.
118. Thus it is clear these two defence witnesses have admitted that atleast 5 appellants namely
Radheshyam, his three sons i.e., Jagdish, Hemraj, and third son and Satish (brother of
Radheshyam) were involved in the brutal murder of Lakhan and Sonu. However, as these witnesses
have expressed that they did not witness the entire incident, therefore, it cannot be said that the
other appellants were not present on the spot.

(D.W.3)
119. This witness has stated that Rameshwar was in the school till 11:00 A.M. This witness claims
himself to be the President of Shikshak Palak Sangh. He is neither the employee nor the Head
Master of the School. Further, the School attendance Register, Ex.
D.11C doesnot contain attestation by any authority/head master. It is really surprising that in the
school, at the relevant time, no other teacher was present. Under these circumstances, this Court is
of the considered opinion, that this witness is not trustworthy and cannot be relied upon to discard
the reliable and trustworthy evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
Puranlal (D.W.6)
120. This witness has stated that on 12-4-2006, Randhir was in the School from 8:00 till 10 A.M.
This witness has produced the attendance register Ex D.16. However, could not identity the
signatures of the authority, who had attested the register. This witness has admitted that the
attendance register doesnot contain his attestation. Further, the President of Palak Shikshak Sangh
have no authority to mark the attendance of the teachers. Since, the appellant Rameshwar has not
examined the witness, who had attested the attendance register, therefore, it is held that the
appellant Rameshwar has failed to prove that he was present in the school at the time of Jagdish &
Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 464 of 2008) Kamlesh & Anr Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 461 of
2008) Teerath Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 462 of 2008) Radheshyam Meena & Anr Vs. State of M.P.
(Cr.A. No. 471 of 2008) Randhir & Ors. Vs. State of M.P. (Cr.A. No. 526 of 2008) incident.
121. Thus, it is held that the appellants have failed to prove that the Appellants Ghasilal,
Rameshwar, Randhir, Pritam, Jitendra, Ramdayal, Kamlesh, Raghuvir and Teerath were not on the
spot.
122. Thus, considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the
considered opinion, that the Prosecution has succeeded in establishing the fact that the appellants
namely Jagdish, Hemraj, Radheshyam, Satish, Randhir, Pritam, Jitendra, Ghasilal, Ramdayal,
