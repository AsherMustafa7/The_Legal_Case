counsel.
These matters need to be heard finally and expeditiously. Since there are three colonies involved
viz., â€œKalandi Gold Cityâ€, â€œPhoenixâ€ and â€œSatellite Hillsâ€, for the convenient hearing
of these 92 cases, it would be expedient to hear the matters Colony-wise, so that the State would also
be in a position to point out various aspects of the matter including the settlements which have been
arrived at between the parties in respect of that particular Colony.
In the meantime, Shri (Dr.) Abhay Khedekar, Additional District Magistrate, Indore, District Indore
MP (who is also personally present in compliance of the earlier order dated 23.01.2023) is also
directed to continue with the process of settlement and consider the proposals given by the accused
persons as also by the complainant (s) and submit a concise report on the next date of hearing.
