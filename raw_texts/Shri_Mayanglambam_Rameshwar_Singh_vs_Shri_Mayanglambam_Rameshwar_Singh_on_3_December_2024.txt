[4] Accordingly, Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh of NPP

Rameshwar Singh was challenged by the petitioner, inter-alia, on the following grounds that:
(i) the returned candidate in his affidavit dated 10.02.2022 of Form-26 for the 12th
Assembly Election submitted that his education qualification is M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from
Delhi University in the year 2002.
However, in the affidavit dated 14.02.2017 of Form-26 submitted to the Returning Officer for the
11th Assembly MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of

Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
(ii) The submission of information for passing of Master Degree in Pol.Sc. from Delhi University in
two different years i.e. 1992 & 2002 in the two affidavits of 2017 & 2022 elections amounts to filing
false affidavit and the same is corrupt and malpractice and his election is liable to be declared null
and void.
[5] It is stated that the cause of action arose on 10.03.2022 and when the election was declared by
the Returning Officer for 37-Kakching Assembly Constituency and election petition filed on
25.04.2022 is within time excluding 23.04.2022 & 24.04.2022 which being holiday. Along with
election petition, a sum of Rs. 2,000/- was also deposited as required under Section 117 of the RP
Act, 1951.

raising the question of maintainability of the election petition being El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 on the
ground of non- compliance of various provisions of the RP Act 1951, the Conduct of Elections Rules,
1961 as well as Chapter VII-A of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019 and the provisions of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with
El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with
El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 6
Returned candidate also filed a recrimination petition being El. Recr. Pet. No. 24 of 2022 with
respect to the El. Pet. No. 35 of 2022. In the application, the applicant/returned candidate raised the
question of maintainability of the election petition for non-compliance of the following provisions:
(a) Sections 81, 83 and 87 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
(b) Rule 94-A of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.
(c) Over VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
(d) Provisions of Chapter VII-A of the High Court of Manipur Rules, 2019.
[7] It is stated that as per Section 81(3) of the R.P. Act, 1951, copy of the election petition served
upon the respondents should be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy,
however, the same has not been complied and unsigned copy has been served. The election
petitioner also fails to disclose the full material facts and particulars of any corrupt practice and not
accompanied by the affidavit of corrupt practice and the election petition is liable to be dismissed for
non-compliance of Section 83(1)(a) & (b) of the R.P. Act, 1951.
[8] In the election petition, nothing is mentioned about Form-26 affidavit dated 10.02.2022
submitted by the returned candidate for the 12th Assembly Election 2022 is false. The petitioner has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66186424/ 5
Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
also failed to mention MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No.
24 of 2022 Page 7 the factum of passing of M.A. (Pol.Sc.) in 2002 as mentioned in para 10 of the
Form-26 affidavit dated 14.02.2017 submitted by the returned candidate for the 2017 Assembly
Election. Hence, the petitioner approached this Court with malafide intension.
[9] It is stated that affidavit of corrupt practice under Rule 94-A of the Conduct of Election Rules,
1961 read with proviso to Section 83(1)(b) of RP Act has not been enclosed and the election petition
is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. The petitioner also failed to sign schedule or annexure
to the election petition in violation of the provisions of Section 83(2) of the R.P. Act, 1951. No
grounds have been pleaded under Section 101 of the R.P. Act, 1951 for declaring the petitioner as
returned candidate and no triable issue has been made out. It is stated that election petition be
dismissed with cost at the threshold for non-compliance of the above- mentioned provisions.
[10] Election petitioner filed written objection to the application filed by the returned candidate for
dismissing election petition. In the objection filed by the election petitioner, nothing specific has
been stated except for mere denial of the averments in the application i.e. MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of
2022 filed by the returned candidate.
[11] The returned candidate also filed rejoinder affidavit to the written objection filed by the election
petitioner stating that the election petitioner has submitted evasive denial and no specific reply has
been given MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022
Page 8 to the question of maintainability raised in the application by the returned candidate.
[12] The points of determination for exercising the power under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC of rejecting
the election petition are:
(i) Whether the alleged wrong information about the highest educational
qualification mentioned in Form-26 affidavit by the returned candidate in 11th
General Assembly Election of Manipur, 2017 for 37-Kakching Assembly Constituency
can be a ground for declaring the election of the returned candidate as void in the
subsequent Assembly Election of 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly held in the year
2022 wherein the returned candidate has given correct information about the highest
educational qualification in his Form 26 affidavit submitted for 2022 Election?
(ii) Whether the election petition is not maintainable for not disclosing the material
facts and particulars of instance of corrupt practice by the returned candidate as
mandated under Section 83(1)(a) & (b) of the RP Act, 1951?
(iii) Whether the election petition is liable to be dismissed at the threshold for not
filing affidavit of corrupt practice as mandated under proviso to Section 83(1) of RP
MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of
2022 Page 9 Act and as mandated under Rule 94-A of the Conduct of Election Rules,
1961?

Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
[13] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel for the returned candidate, submits that as per Section
81 of the R.P. Act 1951, every election petition given to the respondents shall be attested as true copy
by the petitioner under his own signature and the election petitioner has failed to do the same. As
provided under Section 83 of the R.P. Act 1951, the election petition shall contain a concise
statement of material facts and set out full particulars of any corrupt practices as alleged including
name, place, time, date and the nature of corrupt practice and election petition be signed and
verified. In case of corrupt practice, the election petition should be accompanied by an affidavit in
prescribed form for corrupt practice. Learned senior counsel draws the attention of this Court that
there is total non- compliance of the provisions of Section 83(1)(a) & (b) of the R.P. Act 1951, as the
petitioner has failed to disclose the full particulars of any corrupt practice and also separate affidavit
of corrupt practice as provided under proviso to Section 83(1) and Rule 94-A of the Conduct of
Election Rules has not been submitted.
[14] It is also submitted that in Form-26 affidavit submitted by the returned candidate for 2022
Election, the particulars of the highest educational qualification i.e. M.A. (Pol.Sc.) from Delhi
University in the year 2002 is correctly mentioned. Further, in From-26 affidavit for 11th Manipur
Legislative Assembly for 2017 Assembly Election in para 10 of the affidavit, MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of
2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 10 the highest educational
qualification was correctly mentioned as M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in the year 2002.
However, in para 11, due to typographical mistake it was mentioned as M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi
University in the year 1992. It is submitted that the affidavit filed for Assembly Election of 2017
cannot be relied for challenging the election of the returned candidate in the Assembly Election of
2022 when the correct information i.e. M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University is given in Form-26
affidavit of 2022 Election.
[15] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel for returned candidates, relies on the following
decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:
(1) Dhartipakar Madan lal Agarwal -vs- Rajiv Gandhi reported as 1987 (Supp) SCC 93
held that the corrupt practice should be precisely made out by stating separate
instances of corrupt practice. (2) V.S. Achuthanandan -vs- P.J. Francis & Anr.
reported as (1999) 3 SCC 737 holding that election petition can be dismissed by
invoking power under Section 87 of the R.P. Act, 1951 read with provisions of Order 7
Rule 11(a) of the CPC for non-disclosure of the material facts.
(3) Hari Shanker Jain -vs- Sonia Gandhi reported as (2001) 8 SCC 233 holding that in order to
enable a Court to reject a plaint on the ground that does not disclose the cause of action, it should
look at the plaint and nothing else. Failure to plead material facts is fatal to the election petition.

alone and not what is stated in the written statement.
[16] Mr. N. Kumarjit, learned senior counsel, summarising the above decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court, has submitted that in the present petition, the election petitioner has miserably
failed to plead the factum of corrupt practice and also did not file any affidavit of corrupt practice as
mandated under Rule 94-A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and proviso to Section 83(1) of
the R.P. Act. The election petition is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. He further pointed
out that in Form-26 affidavit filed for the Election of 2022, there is no defect and the information
MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 15 of
highest educational qualification as M.A. (Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in the year 2002 was
correctly mentioned. The typographical mistake of highest educational qualification in Form-26
affidavit submitted in the year 2017 Assembly Election cannot be a ground for quashing of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/66186424/ 9
Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
election in the 2022 election. It is clarified that in 2017 affidavit, it was correctly mentioned as M.A.
(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in 2002 in para 10 of the affidavit. However, there is typographical
mistake of mentioning the year 1992 in part- B Column-11 of the same affidavit. Assuming that the
information furnished in Form-26 affidavit of 2017 is false, the same cannot be a ground for
challenging the election of the returned candidate in 2022 election. Since the petitioner has not
pleaded any other grounds, it is prayed that the election petition is filed with malafide intention and
the same may be rejected at this stage with exemplary cost in order to save precious time of this
Court. [17] On the other hand, Mr. M. Rakesh, learned counsel for the election petitioner, submits
that as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Thangjam Arunkumar v.
Yumkham Erabot:
2023 INSC 762, it has been held that affidavit of corrupt practice can be submitted
later on, if there is an averment of complete details of the corrupt practice in the
petition. It is submitted that in para-9 &10 of the election petition, the factum of
corrupt practice by the returned candidate by giving false information about his
highest educational qualification of the election petitioner has been mentioned and as
such, the affidavit if any, can be MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of
2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 16 submitted later on and the same is
curable defect. It is submitted that the application for rejection of plaint be rejected
with exemplary cost. [18] This Court has considered the materials on record, the
submissions made by the parties and the relevant provisions of law and the decisions
in this regard.
[19] According to Section 87 of the R.P. Act, 1951, the election petition shall be tried
by the High Court as nearly as may be in accordance with the procedure prescribed
by the Court of Civil Procedure, implying that the provisions of CPC will be applicable
in election petition except for exclusively stipulated under R.P. Act, 1950 & 1951 and
Rules made therein from time to time.
[20] From the above cited case laws, it is settled proposition of law that the
provisions of CPC with respect to Order 7 Rule 11 for rejection of a plaint is applicable
in an election petition when the petition does not disclose the cause of action. It is
also settled proposition of law that in the election petition, the concise statement of
material facts upon which the election petitioner relies for getting relief from the
Court should be specifically pleaded and also the full particulars of any corrupt
practice such as name, date, place, time and the nature of corrupt practice should be
specifically pleaded and separate affidavit in prescribed form in support of the
allegation of corrupt practice is mandatory as mandated under Rule 94-A of the
Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 read with the proviso to Section 83(1) of RP
MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of
2022 Page 17 Act, 1951. Mere defects not relating to the material facts, such as
absence of endorsement of the Oath Commissioner, etc. are curable defect. However,
if the defect is not cured within the stipulated time, the same is also fatal. Failure to
plead even one instance of material fact is also fatal in an election petition. It is the

Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court that while considering an application for
rejection of the plaint under the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC, only the
averments made in the plaint/petition are to be considered and the plea of the
defendant in the written statement or in the application cannot be considered at all.
[21] The present application has to be examined keeping in mind the above
provisions of the law and the decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court. In the case in
hand, on mere perusal of the election petition filed by the election petitioner, the only
plea of the election petitioner for challenging the election of the returned candidate is
that the returned candidate has furnished wrong information of his highest
educational qualification in Form- 26 affidavit submitted for the State Assembly
Election held in the year 2017.
However, in Form-26 affidavit of 2022 Election (under challenged), the returned candidate has
furnished the correct information of his highest educational qualification as M.A. (Pol.Sc.) from
Delhi University in the year 2002. The challenge in the present election petition is for some alleged
wrong information furnished in Form-26 affidavit of 2017 election and not the present concerned
election of 2022. On full examination of Form-26 affidavit of 2017, it is found that in column-10, the
highest educational qualification is MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with
El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 18 correctly mentioned as M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in
the year 2002 whereas in part-B column-10, the same is inadvertently written as M.A. (Pol.Sc.) from
Delhi University in the year 1992. The same may be typographical error.
[22] Even if assuming that Form-26 affidavit submitted in the election of 2017 of Assembly Election
with respect to highest educational qualification is wrong, this Court is of the opinion that the same
cannot be a ground and material document for challenging the election of the returned candidate in
2022 Assembly Election wherein in Form-26 affidavit, the status of the highest educational
qualification as M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in the year 2002 has been correctly disclosed. In
other word, the election petitioner has miserably failed to point out any wrong information
regarding highest educational qualification of the returned candidate in the affidavit of 2022
Assembly Election and false statement given in the earlier Election of 2017 cannot be a ground to
challenge the election of the returned candidate in the subsequent election held in 2022. At most,
the affidavit of 2017 can be a material fact for challenging the election of returned candidate in the
2017 election and should be confined to for election only. [23] This Court is of the opinion that the
plea for giving false affidavit of highest educational qualification in Form-26 affidavit of 2017
election does not constitute a triable issue in the election petition challenging the election of the
returned candidate in the subsequent election held in 2022. When correct information about the
highest educational qualification is furnished in MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of
2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24 of 2022 Page 19 the 2022 election, the election petition on the sole
ground of furnishing wrong information of highest educational qualification in 2017 election is
bound to be failed and the same is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone. [24] With regard to
the plea of the corrupt practice, the petitioner has miserably failed to mention even any instance of
corrupt practice; specially of time, place, date and the nature of corrupt practice as required under
Section 83(1)(b) of RP Act. The plea of the election petitioner that by giving a false information
about the highest educational qualification in Form- 26 affidavit submitted in 2017 Assembly

Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh vs Shri Mayanglambam Rameshwar Singh on 3 December, 2024
Election, the returned candidate has adopted corrupt practice of misleading the voters in 2022
Assembly Election does not satisfy the rigor and mandate of Section 83(1)(a)(b) of RP Act. [25] This
Court is of the view that the plea is too general without any details and cannot fall within the
definition of "corrupt practice" as defined under Section 123, especially Clause (4), of the R.P. Act,
1951. It is reiterated here that the alleged false information about the highest educational
qualification in the election of 2017 cannot be considered as a factum of corrupt practice, in the
election of 2022 when the returned candidate himself has given correct information of the highest
educational qualification in the affidavit of 2022 election as M.A.(Pol.Sc.) from Delhi University in
the year 2002. Apart from this, there is no other ground for challenging the election of the returned
candidate. In the circumstances, the election petition is liable to be dismissed under Section
83(1)(b) of the R.P. MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No. 24
of 2022 Page 20 Act, 1951 for failure to plead any instances of corrupt practice with full particulars.
[26] The petitioner has not furnished any affidavit of corrupt practice along with the election
petition as mandated under proviso to Section 83(1) of the R.P. Act, 1951 read with provision of Rule
94-A of Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. It is true that mere defect in affidavit is curable, but
non-failing of affidavit of corrupt practice and non-disclosure of full factum particulars of corrupt
practice are not curable defect as held in the above cited decisions. The ratio in Arunkumar case
(supra) will not be applicable in the present case, as the petitioner has not pleaded any specific
instances of corrupt practice with full details in the election petition except for mentioning for
namesake.
[27] In the circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the election petition is liable to
be rejected at this stage by exercising the power under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC for non-disclosure
of material facts and the instance of full particulars of the corrupt practice and non-filing of affidavit
of corrupt practice as required under Section 83 of RP Act, 1951 and Rule 94-A of Conduct of
Election Rules, 1961. Form-26 affidavit of 2017 election cannot be a material for challenging the
election of the returned candidate for the Assembly Election held in 2022. [28] Accordingly, the
application being MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 is allowed and the election petition being El.Pet. No.
35 of 2022 is rejected MC(El.Pet.) No. 73 of 2022 with El.Pet. No. 35 of 2022 with El.Recr.Pet. No.
24 of 2022 Page 21 in exercise of the power under Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC with a cost of Rs.
50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) only to be deposited to the account of High Court Bar Association,
Manipur towards relief fund. The cost should be deposited within one month and the election
petitioner is directed to submit proof of payment of the cost to the registry.
[29] In the case of T A Ahammed Kabeer v. A A Azeez : (2003) 5 SCC 650 @ Para 33, Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that a recrimination petition under Section 97 of RP Act, 1951 will be
maintainable only when '....... the election petition seeks a declaration that any other candidate other
than the returned candidate has been duly elected over and above the declaration that the election of
the returned candidate is void.......'. In other words, the recrimination petition will be maintainable
and can be adjudicated if the election of the returned candidate is likely to be set aside and any other
candidate be declared as elected. If the election petition is dismissed at threshold, there would be no
occasion for the court to entertain the recrimination petition, as both the election petition and
recrimination petition are to be decided in the same proceeding in the nature of counter-claim in a
