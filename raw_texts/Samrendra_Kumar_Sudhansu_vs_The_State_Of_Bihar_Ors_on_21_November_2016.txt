CORAM: HONOURABLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE VIKASH JAIN
ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE) Date: 21-11-2016 The petitioner has invoked
the public interest writ jurisdiction of this Court to challenge the alleged illegal appointments made
on various posts as lecturers/ Principals/ Professors in Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University,
Darbhanga (for short "the University") after 2001 without following and adopting the proper norms
and letters issued by the Government of Bihar from time to time. The prayer is also to take legal
action against the responsible persons who had committed such illegalities in the University and to
recover money from the all mis-utilized Patna High Court CWJC No.21601 of 2014 dt.21-11-2016
funds/grants/illegal appointments after 2001 specifically from 2007 to 2013.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the report submitted by the Vice Chancellor of the
University to the Chancellor of the University on 12.11.2013 admitting various illegalities in the
process of appointment and also mis-utilization of the funds.

3. The question is as to whether public interest litigation at the instance of the petitioner challenging
the alleged illegal appointments would be maintainable. What is asserted by the petitioner is that he
is not directly or indirectly interested in the subject matter, whereas he has raised issues of common
interest of the society; therefore, public interest writ is maintainable by him.
4. The Supreme Court, way back in 1999, in a judgment reported as (1998) 7 SCC 273 (Dr.
Duryodhan Sahu and Ors. v. Jitendra Kumar Mishra and Ors.), has held that in service matters,
public interest litigation should not be entertained. Such judgment was reiterated in later judgment
in the case of Neetu Vs. State of Punjab and Ors. (2007) 10 SCC 714. The view stands reiterated in
another judgment reported as Madan Lal v. High Court of J&K and Ors., (2014) 15 SCC 308,
wherein the Court held as under:-
Patna High Court CWJC No.21601 of 2014 dt.21-11-2016 "9. That apart time and
again this Court repeatedly held that in service matters, public interest litigation is
not maintainable. We can profitably refer to a recent decision reported in Hari Bansh
Lal v.
Sahodar Prasad Mahto, (2010) 9 SCC 655 :( 2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 771. Paras 14 and 15 are relevant
which are as under: (SCC pp. 660-61) "14. In Ashok Kumar Pandey v. State of W.B., (2004) 3 SCC
349: (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 865, this Court held thus: (SCC pp. 358- 59, para 16) â€ž16. As noted supra, a
time has come to weed out the petitions, which though titled as public interest litigations are in
essence something else. It is shocking to note that courts are flooded with a large number of
so-called public interest litigations where even a minuscule percentage can legitimately be called
public interest litigations. Though the parameters of public interest litigation have been indicated by
this Court in a large number of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and objectives, courts are
entertaining such petitions and wasting valuable judicial time which, as noted above, could be
otherwise utilised for disposal of genuine cases. Though in Duryodhan Sahu v. Jitendra Kumar
Mishra, (1998) 7 SCC 273:1998 SCC (L&S) 1802, this Court held that in service matters PILs should
not be entertained, the inflow of so-called PILs involving service matters continues unabated in the
courts and strangely are entertained. The least the High Courts could do is to throw them out on the
basis of the said decision. The other interesting aspect is that in the PILs, official documents are
being annexed without even indicating as to how the petitioner came to possess them. In one case, it
was noticed that an interesting answer was given as to its possession. It was stated that a packet was
lying on the road and when out of curiosity the petitioner opened it, he found copies of the official
documents. Whenever such frivolous pleas are taken to explain possession, the courts should do
well not only to dismiss the petitions but also to impose exemplary costs. It would be desirable for
the courts to filter out the frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs as Patna High Court
CWJC No.21601 of 2014 dt.21-11-2016 aforestated so that the message goes in the right direction
that petitions filed with oblique motive do not have the approval of the courts.(cid:129) The same principles
have been reiterated in the subsequent decisions, namely, B. Singh v. Union of India, (2004) 3 SCC
363: (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 616, Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharashtra, (2005) 1 SCC 590
and Gurpal Singh v. State of Punjab, (2005) 5 SCC 136:
2005 SCC (L&S) 636."

5. The petitioner seems to be busy body. He also has no interest with the affairs of
University and has no credentials in the field of education. There is no other special
interest disclosed by the petitioner, which made him to invoke writ jurisdiction of
this Court.
Such a person, who has no credentials to take up the public causes and totally unrelated to the field
of education, cannot be permitted to invoke the public interest writ jurisdiction of this Court for
collateral purposes.
6. In fact, in the counter affidavit, it has been asserted that the Legislative Council of the State has
constituted an Enquiry Committee on the alleged irregularities committed in the appointments of
Principals in the colleges of different universities including Magadh University in pursuance of the
motion call attention raised by the members of the Legislative Council.
7. It is also pointed out that a show cause notice was issued to the then Vice-chancellor of the said
University in connection with the appointment in violation of the Rules and Patna High Court
CWJC No.21601 of 2014 dt.21-11-2016 Regulations.
8. The fact is that the Chancellor and Vice-chancellor of the University are aware of the illegalities
committed in the functioning of the University from time to time. We are sure that the authorities
will take appropriate follow up action.
9. Thus, it appears that the respondents are aware of the alleged illegalities and are taking remedial
steps, therefore, the public interest litigation at the instance of the petitioner does not seem to be
bonafide.
10. Consequently, present writ application is dismissed.
