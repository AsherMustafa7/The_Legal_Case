For Petitioners : Shri Jai Shukla, Shri Ajay Pal Singh,
Shri Mahendra Pateriya, Shri Ashok Kumar Jain, Shri
D.K.Tripathi, Shri Prashant Singh, Shri V.D.S.Chauhan,
Shri Surendra Kumar Mishra, Shri Pushpendra Kumar

and Shri Bhanu Pratap Yadav counsel for the petitioners in
respective writ petitions.
For Respondents : Shri Pushpendra Yadav, GA.
ORDER
(Delivered on 16.01.2017) Per : Sujoy Paul J.
These batch of petitions were analogously heard on the joint request of learned counsel for the
parties. The facts are taken from W.P.No.17678/2015. Learned counsel for the parties contended
that in all connected matters, similar question of facts and law are involved.
2. The challenge in these petitions is made to the order dated 5.10.2015 whereby the appointment
order of the petitioner was cancelled. The petitioner was appointed by order dated 19.8.2013
(Annexure P/4). Thereafter, a show- cause notice dated 16.6.2015 (Annexure P/7) was issued. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194645595/ 4
Bhaiyalal Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 January, 2017
petitioner filed her reply. Thereafter by impugned order, petitioner's appointment order dated
19.8.2013 was cancelled.
3. Criticizing the said order, learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the earlier order
dated 19.8.13 was issued in accordance with law. There was no misrepresentation of fact by the
petitioners. In the show-cause notice Annexure P/7, no reasons are assigned as to why the said
order was found to be illegal or unjustifiable. The show-cause notice cannot be said to be in
consonance with the principles of natural justice. It is submitted that the impugned order is passed
without assigning any reason about reply of petitioners and, therefore, the said order is bad in law.
4. Prayer is opposed by Shri Pushpendra Yadav, GA for the respondents/State. He submits that
there is no flaw in the decision making process adopted by the respondents. The petitioners were
put to notice and their reply were obtained. This shows that principles of natural justice were
followed by the respondents. Since there were serious irregularities in appointing/ regularizing the
petitioners, the petitioners appointment orders were rightly cancelled.
5. No other point is pressed by learned counsel for the parties.
6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the record.
7. Before dealing with the rival contentions, it is apposite to reproduce the averments of the show-
cause notice dated 16.6.2015 (Annexure P/7). It reads as under :-

8. A plain reading of the show-cause notice shows that no allegations are mentioned against the
petitioners. The entire burden was shifted on the shoulders of the petitioners to show correctness of
process of issuance of appointment/ regularization order.
9. In the opinion of this court, the very purpose of issuance of show-cause notice is to ensure that
the other side comes to know about the specific allegations levelled against her/ him. Thus, in the
show-cause notice, the nature of irregularity/ illegality, must be disclosed with accuracy and
precision. In the case of Canara Bank Vs. Debasis Das, (2003) 4 SCC 557, it was held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/194645595/ 5
Bhaiyalal Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 January, 2017
â(cid:133)(cid:134)15.
â(cid:133)¦.........Notice is the first limb in this principle.
It must be
precise and
unambiguous. It
should apprise
the party
determinatively
of the case he
has to meet.
Time given for
the purpose
should be
adequate so as
to enable him to
make his
representation.
In the absence
of a notice of
this kind and
such reasonable
opportunity, the
order passed
becomes wholly
vitiated.........â(cid:133)(cid:136) (Emphasis supplied)
10. Similarly in the case of Rajesh Kumar Vs. CIT, (2007) 2 SCC 181, the Apex Court opined as
under:
â(cid:133)(cid:134)55.
Justice, as is well known, is not only to be done but manifestly seem to be done. If the
assessee is put to notice, he could show that the nature of accounts is not such which
would require appointment of special auditors. He could further show that what the
assessing officer considers to be complex is in fact not so. It was also open to him to
show that the same would not be in the interest of the Revenue.
56. In this case itself the appellants were not made known as to what led the Deputy
Commission er to form an opinion that all relevant factors including the ones
mentioned in Section 142(2-A) of the Act are satisfied. If even one of them was not
satisfied, no order could be passed. If the attention of the Commission er could be
drawn to the fact that the underlined purpose for appointment for appointment of
the special auditor is not bona fide he might not have approved the same.â(cid:133)(cid:136)
(Emphasis supplied)

11. In the case of Gorkha Security Services Vs. Govt.
(NCT of
Delhi),
(2014) 9
SCC 105,
the Apex
Court laid
down the
law that ;
â(cid:133)(cid:134)21. The central issue, however, pertains to the requirement of stating the action
which is proposed to be taken. The fundamental purpose behind the serving of show-
cause notice is to make the noticee understand the precise case set up against him which he has to
meet. This would require the statement of imputations detailing out the alleged breaches and
defaults he has committed, so that he gets an opportunity to rebut the same............â(cid:133)(cid:136) (Emphasis
supplied)
12. In view of aforesaid legal position, I find substance in the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioners that the show-cause notice issued by the respondents were not in consonance with the
principles of natural justice. The entire burden to prove the validity of regularization order/
appointment order was shifted on the petitioners whereas if department was not satisfied or was of
the opinion that such orders were suffering from any infirmity/ illegality, the department should
have issued specific show-cause notice by mentioning the nature of irregularity/ illegality in the
matter of issuance of appointment/ regularization order. The respondents have not undertaken the
said exercise and, therefore, I have no scintilla of doubt that the said show-cause notice is against
the principles of natural justice. In the impugned order dated 5.10.2015, the decision was taken on
the basis of aforesaid cryptic show-cause notice. In the impugned order, no reasons are assigned as
to why defence taken by the petitioners were not found to be trustworthy. The conclusion is drawn
by holding that the reply received are not satisfactory. The reasons are held to be the heart beat of
conclusions. In absence of reasons, conclusion cannot sustain judicial scrutiny. In M/s Kranti
Associates Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Masood Ahmed Khan and others-(2010) 9 SCC 497, the
Supreme Court emphasized the need of assigning reasons in administrative, quasi judicial and
judicial proceedings. The relevant portion reads as under:
51. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:
a. In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even in
administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.
b. A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its conclusions. c.
Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider principle of justice that
justice must not only be done it must also appear to be done as well.

Bhaiyalal Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 January, 2017
d. Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any possible arbitrary
exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even administrative power.
e. Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the decision maker on
relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous considerations.
f. Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision making
process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and even
by administrative bodies. g. Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by
superior Courts.
h. The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law and
constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on relevant facts.
This is virtually the life blood of judicial decision making justifying the principle that
reason is the soul of justice.
i. Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as different as the judges
and authorities who deliver them. All these decisions serve one common purpose
which is to demonstrate by reason that the relevant factors have been objectively
considered. This is important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery
system.
j. Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability and
transparency. k. If a Judge or a quasi- judicial authority is not candid enough about
his/her decision making process then M/S Kranti Asso. Pvt. Ltd. & Anr vs Masood
Ahmed Khan & Ors on 8 September, 2010 it is impossible to know whether the
person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of
incrementalism. l. Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and
succinct. A pretence of reasons or `rubber- stamp reasons' is not to be equated with a
valid decision making process. m. It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine
qua non of restraint on abuse of judicial powers. Transparency in decision making
not only makes the judges and decision makers less prone to errors but also makes
them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of Judicial Candor
(1987) 100 Harward Law Review 731-737). n. Since the requirement to record
reasons emanates from the broad doctrine of fairness in decision making, the said
requirement is now virtually a component of human rights and was considered part
of Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See (1994) 19 EHRR 553, at 562 para 29 and Anya vs.
University of Oxford, 2001 EWCA Civ 405, wherein the Court referred to Article 6 of
European Convention of Human Rights which requires, "adequate and intelligent
reasons must be given for judicial decisions".
o. In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting up precedents for the future.
Therefore, for development of law, requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the essence
and is virtually a part of "Due Process".

13. If the impugned orders are tested on the anvil of principles of natural justice, it will be clear that
neither the show-cause notice nor the final order cancelling the appointment/ regularization, are
passed by following the principles of natural justice. Apart from this, impugned order of termination
shows that it is based on various reasons which were not subject matter of show- cause notice.
Hence, petitioners could not get any opportunity to putforth their defence in this regard. This is well
settled that principles of natural justice are to be followed even in cases of illegal appointments. {See
: Mahendra Kumar Chourasia Vs. State of M.P.-2002(3) MPLJ-112 and Arvind Kumar Vs. State of
M.P.-2002(3) MPLJ-224.}
14. At the cost of repetition, in the opinion of this court, the show-cause notices are cryptic in nature
and do not contain the reasons, on the strength of which, the respondents intended to cancel the
appointment/ regularization order. The final order is also pregnant with the similar infirmity.
Resultantly, the impugned orders of cancellation of appointment/ regularization in all these
petitions are set aside. Liberty is reserved to the respondents to issue fresh show-cause notice and
proceed against the petitioners in accordance with law by taking into account the observations made
hereinabove. It is made clear that this court has not expressed any opinion on merits of the case.
15. All the aforesaid petitions are allowed. No cost.
