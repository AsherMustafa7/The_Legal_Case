Dharam Veer Singh And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 28 February, 2025
This writ petition has been filed by the petitioner seeking arrears of salary at par with
the salary which is being paid to the Teachers of Government Inter Colleges who have
merged in the L.T. Grade. The petitioners are stated to be Assistant Teachers but they
are getting lesser salary than of the teachers of Model School Inter College. The
petitioners are relying upon the judgment of this Court passed in W.P. No. 3112 (S/S)
of 2011 Krishna Pal Singh and others Vs. State of U.P. and others as well as the
judgment dated 30.3.2002 passed in the W.P. No. 10665 of 2006 Dharampal Singh
Rajpoot and others Vs. State of U.P. and others.
Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and with the consent of
learned counsel for the parties this writ petition is disposed of with a direction that in
case the petitioners are similarly situated as the Teachers of Government Inter
College and they are governed by the judgment of this court, referred to above, they
will also be entitled to the benefit of the said judgments. The decision in this regard
shall be taken by the Director of Education (Secondary), 18 Park Road,
Lucknow-respondent no.4 considering the case of the petitioners particularly with
reference to the decision in the case of Krishna Pal Singh (supra) and Dharampal
Singh Rajpoot (supra) within a period of two months from the date a certified copy of
this order is received in his office."
It is pursuant to the aforesaid order that Director of Education (Secondary) has considered the
petitioner's grievance and the same has been rejected vide order dated 17.12.2014, in view of the fact
that a similar prayer has been rejected in Special Appeal Defective No.816 of 2013, vide order dated
21.11.2013.
The order of the Director is challenged on the ground that there is no adjudication by this Court in
Special Appeal Defective No.816 of 2013, and that the issue is yet to be decided on merits in the writ
petition. Submission is that claim of petitioners was liable to have been considered, in accordance
with law, by passing a reasoned order and the mere fact that Special Appeal Defective No.816 of
2013 has been allowed would not be a relevant consideration.
In order to appreciate the respective submissions urged, it would be appropriate to notice the order
passed by Division Bench on 21.11.2013 in Special Appeal Defective No.816 of 2013, which stands
reproduced:-
"The appeal arises from a judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 27.05.2010. By
the impugned judgment, the learned Single Judge has relied upon a judgment of this
Court at Allahabad dated 30.03.2009 in Writ Petition No.10665 of 2006, directing
that the petitioners there must be paid the same pay scale as is being paid to the
teachers of the Schools. Accordingly, the petition filed by the respondents was
allowed in terms of the judgment dated 30.03.2009, inter alia passed in Writ Petition
No.10665 of 2006.

Dharam Veer Singh And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 28 February, 2025
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submits that the judgment in
Writ Petition No.10665 of 2006 (Dharampal Singh Rajpoot and others Vs. State of
U.P. & Others) is clearly distinguishable since it relates to the disparity in pay scale
admissible to the teachers in Government run Schools and the Government Model
Schools. In the present case, it has been submitted that the respondents are not
employees of Government run Schools, but of private aided Colleges to whom the
benefit of the aforesaid judgment was not extended.
Our attention has been drawn to a judgment delivered by one of us (Justice Ritu Raj
Awasthi) in Service Single No.5942 of 2012 (Kalika Prasad Mishra and others Vs.
State of U.P. & Others), where the aforesaid judgment dated 30.03.2009 was
distinguished, as follows:-
"The judgment and order dated 30.3.2009 passed in Writ Petition No.10665 of 2006
relates to the disparity in the pay scale admissible to the teachers working in
government run schools and the Government Model Schools. The Court while
allowing the writ petition has issued direction that petitioners who are the employees
of different Government Intermediate Colleges shall be paid the same pay scale as is
being paid to the teachers of Model Schools. The first paragraph of the judgment
itself indicates that petitioners are assistant teachers in different Intermediate
Colleges in district Bijnor and J.P. Nagar.
In the present case, petitioners being assistant teachers in Government Aided College
are not similarly placed, hence, I am of the opinion that controversy decided in Writ
Petition No.10665 of 2006 does not relate to the petitioners."
The aforesaid petition was hence dismissed.
In our opinion, the learned Single Judge has not really considered the applicability of the judgment
in Dharampal Singh Rajpoot (supra) in the facts of the present case. The distinguishing features, if
any, have not been duly taken into account. Hence, without expressing any final opinion on the
merits of the case and since the issue has not been considered in its entirety, we allow this appeal
and set aside the judgment and order dated 27.05.2010. In consequence, we restore the Writ
Petition No.3226 (S/S) of 2010 to the file of the learned Single Judge for disposal afresh. We clarify
that all the rights and contentions of the parties before the learned Single Judge are specifically kept
open.
The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. There shall be no order as to costs."
Perusal of the order passed in special appeal would go to show that judgment of the learned Single
Judge in Writ Petition No.3226 (S/S) of 2010 has been set aside and the matter has been directed to
be heard afresh by the learned Single Judge. In such circumstances, there is no final adjudication of
dispute by this Court and the Director would not be justified in rejecting petitioners' claim on
account of the orders passed in Special Appeal Defective No.816 of 2013. Since the order of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64928330/ 3
Dharam Veer Singh And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 28 February, 2025
Director of Education fails to advert to the submissions of the petitioners for securing parity in pay
has not been adjudicated by a reasoned order, the order impugned dated 17th December, 2014
cannot be sustained and is, accordingly, quashed.
The matter stands remitted to the Director for a fresh consideration of cause, in accordance with
law, within a period of three months from the date of presentation of certified copy of this order.
The Government Order dated 24.1.1974 or any subsequent Government Order, which may have
been issued in that regard, shall be specifically taken note of. The authorities shall also take note of
the judgment dated 17.12.2012 passed in Special Appeal Defective No.865 of 2012.
Writ petition, accordingly, stands disposed of. "
In pursuance of above order, the impugned order dated 25.04.2019 was passed,
whereby the claim of petitioner was rejected and, therefore, petitioners have
impugned the said order.
Sri Rajesh Kumar Singh, learned counsel for petitioner refers the observation of this
Court when matter was remitted for consideration that they were not considered in
its letter and spirit as well as that since there is a reference in impugned order about a
writ petition pending before the Lucknow Bench of this Court on same issue,
therefore, respondent ought to have waited till outcome of it.
The Court staff has checked the outcome of said writ petition and it is informed that a
bunch of writ petitions were decided on 24.08.2021 and for reference the said order
is reproduced hereinafter :-
"1. Heard Sri Som Kartik, Dr. Manoj Dubey, Sri Rang Nath Mishra, Sri Nagendra
Bahadur Singh, Sri Ajay Pratap Singh, Sri Santosh Kumar Tripathi, Sri Gaurav
Mehrotra, learned counsel for the petitioners, and Sri Raghvendra Singh, learned
Advocate General, assisted by Sri Sanjeev Singh, learned counsel for the respondents.
2. Since this bunch of writ petitions involves common question of law and facts as
such it is being decided by a common order. However, the facts of Writ Petition
No.5221 (SS) of 2013 are taken into consideration for deciding the writ petitions.
3. By means of the instant writ petition, the petitioner has prayed for a mandamus
commanding the respondents to pay the same salary along with arrears in the same
pay scale, without any discrimination and distinction, in accordance with the
judgment and order dated 30.05.2011 passed in Writ Petition No.3112 (SS) of 2011 in
re: Krishna Pal Singh and others vs. State of U.P. and others, a copy of which has
been filed as Annexure-22 to the writ petition, and in accordance with the judgment
and order dated 30.03.2009 passed in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.10665 (SS) of
2006, a copy of which has been filed as Annexure-8 to the writ petition.

Dharam Veer Singh And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 28 February, 2025
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners argues that all the petitioners in this bunch of
writ petitions are working in private aided institutions and they claim parity with the
teachers who are working in Government schools regarding pay scale.
5. Reliance has been placed on the judgment of this Court dated 30.05.2011 passed in
the case of Krishna Pal Singh and others vs. State of U.P. and others in Writ Petition
No.3112 (SS) of 2011, a copy of which has been filed as Annexure-22 to the writ
petition, as well as the judgment of this Court dated 30.03.2009 passed in Writ
Petition No.10665 (SS) of 2006 in the case of Dharampal Singh Rajpoot and others
vs. State of U.P. and others, a copy of which has been filed as Annexure-8 to the writ
petition.
6. Further, reliance has also been placed on the Government order dated 24.01.1974,
a copy of which has been filed as Annexure-21 to the writ petition and a legible copy
of the same has been filed as SCA-2 to the supplementary counter affidavit dated
25.03.2019, to contend that the Government itself has given parity to the teachers
working in the private aided institutions with that of Government teachers and thus
now at this stage there cannot be any occasion for the respondents to discriminate in
the pay scales of the petitioners with that of Government teachers.
7. The claim of the petitioners is opposed by learned Advocate General on the basis of
averments contained in the counter affidavit as well as supplementary counter
affidavit dated 25.03.2019.
8. It is contended that the aforesaid judgments would not be applicable in the case of
the petitioners as they are all teachers working in the private aided institutions.
Placing reliance on the averments contained in paragraph 8 (c) of the supplementary
counter affidavit dated 25.03.2019, it is indicated that where the appointment,
promotion, transfer and punishment process for the teachers of the Government
Intermediate Colleges are different from that of the petitioners who are working in
the private aided institution and whose working conditions are controlled and
governed by the Committee of Management consequently the same itself is sufficient
for different pay scales being paid to the teachers of the private aided institutions.
9. So far as the Government Order dated 24.01.1974 is concerned, it is sought to be
distinguished by learned Advocate General by arguing that it was a one time measure
which was given to such teachers and the said Government order has not been
reiterated subsequently and as such parity of pay scales of government teachers
cannot be given to the petitioners.
10. Having heard learned counsel for the contesting parties and having perused the
records, what is apparent is that the petitioners have prayed for a mandamus for
payment of same pay scale as is being paid to their counterparts working in the
Government institutions. Reliance has been placed on various judgments of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64928330/ 5
Dharam Veer Singh And 2 Others vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 28 February, 2025
Court which have been opposed by learned Advocate General on the ground that the
said judgments are not applicable inasmuch as the petitioners are working in private
aided institutions which fact has nowhere been considered in the said judgments and
once appointment process of such teachers is completely at variance with that of
teachers appointed in the Government institutions as such that would be sufficient
for payment of different pay scales.
11. Be that as it may, what the Court finds is that a specific averment has been made
by the respondents in paragraph 11 of the supplementary counter affidavit that the
petitioners have never approached the State Government for redressal of their
alleged grievance.
12. Thus, the fact of the matter remains that once the petitioners have approached
this Court for a mandamus and their claim is still to be considered by the
respondents at the first instance as such it would not be expedient for this Court to
enter into the merits of the claim set forth by the petitioners at this stage.
13. Considering the aforesaid, this bunch of writ petitions is disposed off leaving it
open to the petitioners to approach the respondents for redressal of their grievance
with respect to payment of pay scale as has been paid to their counterparts in the
Government institutions. In case the petitioners approach the respondents by way of
individual representations mentioning therein the complete details with regard to
their appointment, date of retirement, the institution in which they were appointed
and other details in support of their claim within a period of four weeks from the date
of receipt of a certified copy of this order then respondent no.1 shall proceed to
consider the grievance of the petitioners in accordance with law and relevant rules
and pass a reasoned and speaking order on the same within a further period of four
months from the date of receipt of such representations along with certified copy of
this order.
14. It is made clear that this Court has not entered into the merits of the claim set
forth by the petitioners. "
At this stage, learned counsel for petitioner fairly submits that the outcome of above referred writ
petition is now before this Court, therefore, instead of creating any ambiguity, this writ petition may
be disposed of that claim of petitioner may be considered afresh in the light of above referred
observations also.
In the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned order dated 25.04.2019 is set aside and matter is
remitted back to decide afresh. In case, the government has already decided the grievance of
petitioners of above referred writ petitions, the same may also be communicated to petitioners
otherwise petitioners' case be considered along with said writ petitioners within a short period
preferably within six months.
