JUDGMENT
[1] Heard Mr. H S. Paonam, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. B.R. Sharma, learned counsel
appearing for the applicant, Mr. S. Chittaranjan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.
1, Mr. Ajoy Pebam, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 2 and Mrs. L. Ayangleima,
learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 3.
The present application had been filed under Order-VI Rule-16 read with Section 151 of the CPC
with the prayer for striking off paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 of the Election
Petition No. 24 of 2022 filed by the respondent No. 1 herein.
Contd.../-
[2] It has been contended by Mr. H.S. Paonam, learned senior counsel appearing for the applicant
that the pleadings made in paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 of the election petition
are liable to be struck off as the same are unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious in nature,
which tends to prejudice, embarrass the applicant. It has also been submitted that the election
petitioner is using the election petition as a tool to advance his political goals by soiling the clean
image of the applicant/ Returned Candidate and the same is nothing but abuse of the process of the
Court in order to keep himself relevant in the eyes of the voters and to ventilate his humiliation and
heart burnt of being defeated in the hands of the applicant/ Returned Candidate.
[3] The learned senior counsel further submitted that Order-VI Rule-16 of the CPC, 1908 provides
for the court to order that any matter in any pleadings before it be struck out on the grounds
specified under clauses (a), (b) and (c) and that the very purpose of the Rule is to ensure that parties
to a legal proceeding are entitled ex debito justitiae to have the case against them presented in an
intelligible form so that they may neither be embarrassed nor lost in meeting the case.

Shri Thangjam Arunkumar vs Shri Yumkham Erabot Singh on 11 April, 2023
[4] It has also been contended on behalf of the applicant that the pleadings made in paragraphs No.
4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 of the election petition lacks material facts constituting the cause
of action required under various provisions of the Representation of People Act, 1951 and does not
fulfil the mandatory requirement of law. The learned counsel submitted that the election petition
does not contain a concise statement of material facts on which the petitioner relies and therefore
does Contd.../-
not disclose a triable issue or cause of action and that the so called specific allegations of corrupt
practice as contained in paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 does not meet out the
basic requirements, which could constitute corrupt practice or a cause of action as required by law.
It has also been contended that the material facts as to how the information came to the knowledge
of the election petitioner pertaining to various incidences, as mentioned in the referred paragraphs,
is absolutely missing, whereas the same is preliminary requirement for maintainability of the
election petition. The learned senior counsel contended that even the material particulars are absent
in the election petition and thus it suffers from non-compliance of the provisions contained under
Section 81 and 83 of the RP Act, 1951.
[5] It has also been submitted on behalf of the applicant that the averments made in the election
petition are completely vague and lacking in material particulars and as such, no trial or enquiry is
permissible on the basis of such vague, indefinite, imprecise averments and that the non-disclosure
of the cause of action, material facts and violation of Section 81 and 83 of the RP Act, 1951 and
Rule-94 A of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 makes paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17
and 7 of the election petition unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous, vexatious and the same tends to
cause prejudice and embarrassment to the respondent No. 1 and accordingly, the said paragraphs
deserves to be strike off in the interest of justice.
[6] Mr. S. Chittaranjan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1 submitted that the
election petition had been filed in the context of the Contd.../-
gross misrepresentation and concealment of facts, documents, assets, liabilities and holdings by the
applicant in filing Form-26 affidavit along with his nomination papers in the 12th Manipur
Legislative Assembly Election held in the month of February and March, 2022 and that the actions
and omissions of the applicant as detailed in the election petition are sufficient to constitute a case
for setting aside the election of the applicant in terms of Section 100 of the Representation of People
Act, 1951 (RP Act, 1951) being violative of Section 33 and 33A of the RP Act, 1951 read with Rule-4A
of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 as well as instructions/ informations issued by the Election
Commission of India under Article 324 of the Constitution of India and being writ large with
instances of corrupt practice as defined under Section 123 of the RP Act, 1951. [7] Mr. S.
Chittaranjan, learned counsel submitted that the respondent No. 1/ election petitioner disclosed all
relevant and material facts in the connected election petition and the details of specific violation of
law as well as commission of corrupt practice have been made and the pleadings in the election
petition have been made in due compliance of the provisions of Section 83 of the RP Act, 1951 and
the question as to whether the pleadings made in the election petition are sufficient or not can only
be determined at the time of final hearing of the election petition. It has also been submitted that

Shri Thangjam Arunkumar vs Shri Yumkham Erabot Singh on 11 April, 2023
the allegations made in the election petition are in connection with improper acceptance of the
nomination of the applicant and non-compliance with the statutory provisions and that the
allegations regarding corrupt practice under Section 123 of the RP Act, 1951 is related Contd.../-
with the concealment of material information in Form-26 affidavit of the applicant which amounts
to undue influence.
[8] The learned counsel for the respondent No. 1 further submitted that the applicant has knowledge
of the dispute in Bank loan, loan taken by his spouse, Bank Account opened in the name of himself,
his spouse, his dependent, Government due/ liability, etc. and that a legal duty is cast upon the
applicant to disclose the details of all the material information of himself, his spouse and his
dependant in his affidavit in Form-26, but for reason best known to him, the applicant failed to
disclose such information and such non-disclosure of the material information amounts to violation
of the provisions of the RP Act, 1951 and rules made thereunder and hence, his election is fit to be
declared as null and void as provided under Section 100 of the RP Act, 1951. The learned counsel
strenuously submitted that all these material facts and relevant particulars are elaborately and
precisely pleaded in his election petition, more particularly in paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15,
4.16, 4.17 and 7 which the applicant is seeking for striking out in the present application and that if
the pleadings in the said paragraphs are struck out, then, the election petition will have no stand for
claiming the reliefs sought for therein. It has also been submitted that the present application does
not even disclose the basic grounds and ingredients of that of the tenets of Order-VI Rule-16 of the
CPC and the present application is devoid of merit and the same had been filed with malafide
intention of delaying the proceedings of the election petition and accordingly the same is liable to be
dismissed with heavy cost Contd.../-
[9] Mr. Ajoy Pebam and Mrs. L. Ayangleima, learned counsels appearing for the respondents No. 2
and 3 endorsed the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No. 1.
[10] I have heard the rival arguments of the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and
have also carefully examined the materials available on record. The object and purpose of the
pleading is to ensure that the litigants came to trial with all issues clearly defined and to prevent
cases being expanded or grounds being shifted during trial. Its object is also to ensure that each side
is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised or considered so that they may have an
opportunity of placing the relevant evidence appropriate to the issue before the court for its
consideration. Since the object and purpose is to enable the opposite party to know the case he has
to meet with, all pleadings must be pleaded in support of the case set up by the petitioner. In the
absence of pleadings, a party cannot be allowed to lead evidence and failure to state even a single
material fact will entail dismissal of the suit or petition. Particulars, on the other hand, are the
details of the case which is in the nature of evidence, a party would be leading at the time of trial. On
the other hand, the object of framing issues is to identify from the pleadings the question or points
required to be decided by the courts so as to enable the parties to led evidence thereon. When the
facts necessary to make out a particular claim, or to seek a particular relief, are not found in the
plaint, the court cannot focus the attention of the parties or its attention on that claim or grant relief
by framing appropriate issues. Thus, it is said that no amount of evidence, Contd.../-

Shri Thangjam Arunkumar vs Shri Yumkham Erabot Singh on 11 April, 2023
on a plea that is not put forward in the pleadings, can be looked into to grant any relief.
[11] In the present case, the election petition had been filed in the context of the gross
misrepresentation and the concealment of facts, documents, assets, liabilities and holdings by the
applicant at the time of filing his affidavit in Form-26 along with his nomination papers in
connection with the 12th Manipur Legislative Assembly Election. On careful perusal of the
averments made in the election petition, more particularly the averments made in paragraphs No.
4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7, this Court find that the election petitioner, respondent No.1
herein, elaborately and concisely pleaded all the material facts and set forth full particulars of all the
actions and omissions of the applicant which are sufficient to constitute the case for claiming to set
aside the election of the applicant in terms of the relevant provisions of the RP Act, 1951. In fact, the
averments made in paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 of the election petition are
primary facts for claiming the reliefs sought for in the election petition and in my considered view, if
the averments made in the said paragraphs are struck out as prayed for by the applicant in the
present application, the election petition cannot stand on the basis of the remaining averments.
[12] It will be also pertinent to mention here that the applicant, who is the respondent No 1 in the
election petition, had already filed his written statement and in the said written statement the
applicant did not make even a whisper about the averments made in the said paragraphs as being
unnecessarily, scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, tend to prejudice, Contd.../-
embarrass or an abuse of the process of the court. In the said written statement, the applicant
generally denied some of the averments made in the said paragraphs and admit some of the
averments. On careful consideration of the pleadings made in the election petition, this Court is not
inclined to entertain the claim of the applicant made in the present application as this Court is of the
considered view that the applicant has failed to satisfy this Court that the averments made in
paragraphs No. 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 7 of the election petition are either unnecessary,
scandalous, frivolous and vexatious, or that they are such as may tend to prejudice, embarrass or
delay the fair trial of the election petition, or that the averments are such as to constitute an abuse of
the process of the court as contemplated under the provisions of Order-VI Rule- 16 of the CPC.
In the result, the application is hereby dismissed as being devoid of merit. Parties are to bear their
own cost.
