(BALARAM Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH)
Indore, Dated : 07-06-2021
Shri Vivek Singh, learned counsel for the applicant.
Shri Devashish Dubey, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent/State.
Heard through video conferencing.
T his is the first bail application under Section 438 Cr.P.C. The applicant apprehends arrest in
connection with Crime No. 134/2021 registered at P.S.Sitamau, District- Mandsaur for the offence
punishable under Section 8/20 NDPS Act.
A s per prosecution story, co-accused Jagdish was found carrying ganja weighing 1 kg 500 gm from
the spot. Accordingly, he was arrested. During investigation, he disclosed the name of present
applicant as the person who has procured the aforesaid contraband. Under such circumstances,
applicant apprehends arrest.
Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated
in the offence. He submits that co-accused Jagdish has been enlarged on bail by order dated
07.05.2021 passed in M.Cr.C. No. 19194/2021. Applicant shall abide by all such terms and
conditions as this Court deems fit and proper. Under such circumstances, applicant may be granted
anticipatory bail.
Per contra, learned Panel Lawyer opposes the bail application supporting the order impugned with
the submission that there are no criminal antecedents against the applicant. However, his
complicity cannot be ruled out as there is a specific disclosure of his name by the co-accused
Jagdish. Moreover, it shall be the matter of further investigation regarding complicity of the
applicant. Hence, applicant does not deserve to be enlarged on anticipatory bail.
At this stage, Shri Vivek Singh submits that if the Panel Lawyer makes a statement that there are no
criminal antecedents of the applicant, mere 2 MCRC-25327-2021 statement of Jagdish cannot be
conclusive to implicate the applicant. He further submits on instructions that applicant has done
introspection and volunteers to deposit an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh only) in the
office of Zila Balsanrakshan Samiti, Mandsaur (Bank of India Account No.912910210000074, IFSC
