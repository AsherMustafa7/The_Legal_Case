For Petitioner : Ms.G.Sridevi
For Respondents : M.D.Ilayaraja, Govt.Advocate
ORDER
Petitioner was appointed as Assistant Inspector of Sericulture, and joined duty on 02.05.1980 and
promoted as Inspector of Sericulture with effect from 07.02.1986. During 2001, while he was
discharging his duties as Senior Inspector of Sericulture an auction was conducted on 17.04.2001 to
dispose of 66 numbers of dried out trees, whereas the contractor while cutting down the auctioned
dried out trees illegally cut down ten numbers of green living trees also. Since the petitioner was 2nd
level supervisory officer, he was issued with the charge memo dated 27.11.2001 for the above said
irregularity. He received the charge memo on 13.12.2001 and submitted his reply on 22.12.2001.
An enquiry was conducted and the charges were held proved. The enquiry report was submitted to
Government on 29.11.2005 for passing final orders. On 30.03.2008, the enquiry report was
communicated to the petitioner and he made a further representation on 10.04.2008. Thereafter,
after affording personal hearing to the petitioner on 25.11.2010, the order of punishment was issued
in G.O.Ms.No.48, Handlooms, Handicrafts, http://www.judis.nic.in Textiles and Khadi Department
dated 06.04.2011 awarding punishment of stoppage of increment for six months with cumulative
effect.
3. While this being so, the next promotional post from that of Inspector of Sericulture is Assistant
Director of Sericulture. The crucial date for preparing the panel for every year is 1st April of that
year. Since the petitioner was undergoing currency of punishment he was not included in the panel
for the year 2010-11 and 2011-12. Thereafter, on attaining the age of superannuation the petitioner
retired from service on 31.01.2012. In the meanwhile petitioner made a representation on 17.12.2011
for including his name in the panel for promotion to the post of Assistant Director of Sericulture.
However, to his dismay his name was not included, but his junior viz., T.A.Kathirvel was promoted
as Assistant Director of Sericulture on 04.10.2010. Aggrieved over the non inclusion in the panel,
the petitioner has challenged the rejection letter G.O.Ms.No.235 (H,HH,T & K (G1) Dept dated
09.11.2012 issued by the 1st respondent and seek for grant of notional promotion from the date on
which his immediate junior was promoted.
4. The 2nd respondent filed elaborate counter on behalf of the 1st respondent setting out that during
the currency of punishment the petitioner is not entitled to get included in the panel for promotion.
http://www.judis.nic.in Learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondents would
vehemently argue that the petitioner having suffered the punishment is not entitled to get
promotion during the currency of the punishment and therefore the rejection order is valid.

5. I have considered the submissions.
6. It is pertinent to note that a charge memo dated 27.11.2001 was issued for an irregularity that
happened on 07.09.2001. The petitioner has submitted his reply on 22.12.2001 i.e within one month
from the date of receipt of charge memo. It is expected that enquiry into the charge memo should be
conducted and completed within a reasonable period. For irregularity involving officers like
Assistant Director, 3 Junior Inspector of Sericulture would reach its logical conclusion within 6
months or at the most one year. Again it is pertinent to note that this petitioner joined the service
between 18.04.2001 and 26.09.2001 at that particular station where the irregularity said to have
taken place on 07.09.2001. Therefore, it is clear that the incident had taken place within few months
of his joining in the new station. Be that as it may, had the disciplinary proceedings ended in time
and award of punishment of stoppage of increment for 6 months with cumulative effect was
imposed within a reasonable time, the petitioner http://www.judis.nic.in would have undergone
punishment within 6 months thereafter i.e before 2002 or 2003. In that event, could have been
included after the lapse of five years check period, in the panel for the post of Assistant Director of
Sericulture in the year 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12. The punishment was imposed on 06.04.2011
after a period of 10 years and after the crucial date for considering the name for inclusion in the
panel for the year 2011-12.
7. As contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that as per the judgment of the Full Bench
of this court in The Deputy Inspector General of Police, thanjavur Range vs. V.Rani, 2011 (3) CTC
129, after the currency of punishment the Government servant is entitled to be considered for
promotion to the next post if otherwise eligible. It is observed as under:
“.......
28.(1) It is needless to state that after the currency of punishment period, the
Government servant is entitled to be considered for promotion to the next post, if
otherwise eligible.”
8. It is also found by the Hon'ble Full Bench that the G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and Administrative
Reforms Department, dated 18.10.1993 issued by the Chief Secretary to Government by order of the
http://www.judis.nic.in Governor, cannot be equated to the Statutory Rules framed under the
proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India and it can utmost be Administrative instructions
issued under Article 162 of the Constitution Therefore the embargo put on the right of the
Government servant being considered for promotion during the pendency of minor punishment is
impermissible.
“28.....
3. The detailed instructions issued by the Government in G.O.Ms.No.368, Personnel and
Administrative Reforms Department dated 18.10.1993 issued by the Chief Secretary to Government
by order of the Governor, cannot be equated to the statutory rules framed under the proviso to
Article 309 of the Constitution of India and it can utmost be administrative instructions issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145360100/ 3
V.Kandaswami vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 8 January, 2020
under Article 162 of the Constitution of India. In any event, the said Government Order does not
deal with the case of promotion of a Government servant during the currency of punishment.
4. The Government letter No.18824/S/2005-2, Personnel and Administrative Reforms (S)
Department dated 7.10.2005 with annexures 1 to 7 and the letter No.248 (P&AR) Department dated
20.10.1997 are not statutory rules framed under proviso Article 309 of the Constitution of India and
cannot be read either with the Tamil Nadu Government Servants Conduct Rules, 1973
http://www.judis.nic.in or under the Tamil Nadu Civil Service (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules.
5. Consequently, the embargo put on the right of Government servant for being considered for
promotion for a further period, after the period of minor punishment is over, in the name of “check
period” viz., one year in the case of censure and five years in the case other minor punishments is
illegal and impermissible under the statutory rules.”
9. By way of administrative instructions, G.O.Ms.No.248. Personnel and Administrative Reforms (S)
Department dated 20.10.1997, it is categorically provided that effect of punishment on inclusion in
the panel will not affect the delinquencies which occurred five years prior to the crucial date of such
punishment.
“ II. Effect of punishments on inclusion in the panel.
.....
2. Any punishment other than “Censure” imposed on an officer within a period of five years prior to
the crucial date should be held against officer. In such a case the officer's name should be passed
over.
Provided that if the officer was imposed with any of the punishments within the check period as
mentioned above for irregularities/delinquencies which occurred five years prior to the crucial date
such punishment need not be held against him if such punishment is not in currency on the crucial
date and on http://www.judis.nic.in the date of consideration of the panel”
10. After the judgment of the Full Bench, the Government has enacted Tamil Nadu Government
Servants (Conditions of Service) Act, 2016 Sec.7(1) Schedule XI under Annex Sec.7(1) of the Act
provides for consideration of members for inclusion in the approved list, which reads as under:
“II. Consideration of members for inclusion in the approved list.
......
13. If a member of service is imposed with punishment for irregularities or
delinquencies that were committed five years prior to the crucial date, his name shall
be considered for promotion or appointment to a post, if the member of service is not
undergoing such punishment on the crucial date or on the date of consideration for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145360100/ 4
V.Kandaswami vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 8 January, 2020
actual promotion.”
11. From the reading of the proviso, it is made clear that the punishment imposed for a delinquency
or irregularity committed before 5 years prior to the crucial date, his name shall be considered for
promotion, if the member was not undergoing such punishment on the crucial date. In that view of
the matter, the irregularity that had happened in the year 2001, and the punishment was imposed
only on 06.04.2011. The petitioner's http://www.judis.nic.in junior one T.A.Kathirvel was
considered for the panel for the year 2009-10. As already discussed the crucial date for inclusion in
the panel is 1 st April of every year. The punishment was imposed in on 6th April 2011. i.e on the
crucial dates of the respective years viz., 01.04.2009, 01.04.2010 and 01.04.2011, the petitioner was
eligible to be included in the panel for promotion. Apart from this punishment the respondents do
not come out with any disqualification against the petitioner. In those circumstances, it should be
construed that the petitioner was otherwise eligible to be considered for inclusion in the panel for
promotion to the post Assistant Director of Sericulture with effect from 2009-10 onwards. He
should have been considered from 2009-10 to 2010-11, for, the alleged irregularity happened in the
year 2001 which is 8 years prior to the date of consideration. His junior T.A. Kathirvel was included
and promoted to the post of Assistant Director of Sericulture on 04.10.2010. Therefore, the rejection
order impugned in the writ petition passed by the 1 st respondent on the pretext that during the
pendency of charges under 17(b) and during the currency of punishment the petitioner cannot be
included in the panel for promotion cannot be accepted. The delay caused due to the administrative
lethargy in completing the major penalty disciplinary proceedings initiated in the year 2001, and
imposing a minor penalty after a decade shall not deprive of the petitioner his invaluable right to be
http://www.judis.nic.in considered for promotion.
15. Therefore, the impugned order in G.O.Ms.No.235 (Handlooms, Handicrafts, Textiles and
Khadi(G1) Department) dated 09.11.2012 is set aside and a consequential direction is issued to the
respondents to consider the inclusion of the name of the petitioner for notional promotion with
effect from 04.10.2010 the date on which is immediate junior was promoted and pass orders in the
light of clause 13 of part II of Schedule XI of Tamil Nadu Government Servants (Conditions of
service) Act 2016 within a period of 12 weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
Petitioner is entitled to all consequential monetary and attendant benefits attached with the
notional promotion.
With the above direction, the writ petition is allowed. No costs.
