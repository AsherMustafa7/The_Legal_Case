5. The instant application has been filed seeking release of the applicant on bail in Case Crime No.
337 of 2024, under Sections 115(2), 351(2), 105, 190, 191(3) BNS, Police Station Koraon, District
Prayagraj, during pendency of the trial in the court below.
6. FIR of the present case was lodged on 26.11.2024 at 20:36 hours against the applicant and two
others and according to the FIR on 26.11.2024 at about 4:15 p.m. in the evening applicant and other
two accused made assault upon the son of the informant through wooden stick due to which he
sustained serious injuries.
7. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that initially FIR of the present case was lodged
under sections 115(2), 352, 351(2) BNS but after the death of the injured i.e. son of the informant,
case was converted under section 105 BNS.
8. He further submitted that from the FIR it reflects that informant of the case was not the eye
witness.
9. He further submitted that after two days, Seshmani Shukla the brother of the deceased moved an
application on 28.11.2024 and stated that he was alongwith the deceased at the time of incident and
he claimed himself to be an eye witness and he also stated that applicant alongwith four others made
assault.
10. He next submits, above named Sheshmani Shukla is the sole eye witness as per the prosecution
and this fact was first time surfaced through his application but he moved application after two days
even after the death of the deceased and informant also did not disclose in the FIR that he was
alongwith the deceased at the time of incident, therefore, it appears he was also not the eye witness.
11. He further submitted that even from the post mortem report it reflects that deceased sustained
two injuries and as per the allegation made by alleged eye witness Seshmani Shukla in his
application dated 28.11.2024 five persons made assault and this fact again falsifies the prosecution
case.
12. He further submitted that even on the basis of injuries sustained by deceased at this stage it can
not be said that accused persons were having any intention to cause death of the deceased.
13. He further submitted that applicant is having no criminal history and he is in jail in the present
matter since 30.11.2024.
14. Per contra, learned counsel for the informant vehemently opposed the prayer for bail and
submitted that applicant is very influential and entire investigation is tainted one and Investigating
Officer is dancing on the tune of applicant side.
15. He further submitted that from the FIR it reflects that it was lodged on 26.11.2024 at 20:36
hours in the late evening but from the medical report of the deceased dated 26.11.2024 which was
prepared at 5:35 p.m. in the evening which has been annexed alongwith the counter affidavit filed by

the informant it reflects that in the medical report even details of the case crime number and
sections are mentioned and it is quite surprising that even before lodgement of the FIR how these
details find place in the medical report which was prepared earlier then lodgement of the FIR.
16. He further submitted that from the x-ray report of the deceased which he was procured through
whats app message, it reflects that as many as 8 fractures were found but surprisingly in the post
mortem only two injuries were noted by the autopsy surgeon and therefore, all these facts clearly
suggests that the investigation of the case could not conducted properly and only with intention to
extent benefit to the applicant and other accused, a tainted investigation was conducted.
17. Learned counsel for the informant, however, could not dispute that only Sheshmani Shukla was
the sole eye witness and this fact could only be revealed first time through his application which was
moved by him after two days after the death of the deceased.
18. Learned AGA also opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that it appears that investigation of
the case could not be properly conducted but it could not be reflected that due to influence of
applicant's side it is tainted. He also could not dispute that Sheshmani Shukla is the sole eye witness
and this fact could only be revealed when he moved application after two days after the death of
deceased.
19. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of the case.
20. However, from the entire material available on record it reflects Investigating Officer of the case
conducted investigation of the case in most cursory and tainted manner but as far as merit of the
present case is concerned, admittedly, even as per counsel for the informant only Sheshmani
Shukla, the brother of the deceased was the eye witness who allegedly was alongwith the deceased at
the time of incident but this fact could only be revealed when he moved an application to the police
station concerned on 28.11.2024 i.e. after two days and from the FIR which was lodged on
26.11.2024 it could not be revealed that he was alongwith the deceased, therefore, prima facie his
presence at spot appears to be doubtful.
21. Further, except, Sheshmani Shukla, there is no eye witness account.
22. Further, applicant is having no criminal history and he is in jail in the present matter since
30.11.2024.
23. Therefore, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, discussed above, in my view,
applicant is entitled to be released on bail.
24. Accordingly, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the instant bail
application is allowed.
25. Let the applicant-Rahul Kumar, be released on bail in the aforesaid case on furnishing a
personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned
