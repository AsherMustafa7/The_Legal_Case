The State Health Society vs Kanchan Kumar Mishra on 13 October, 2025
Patna High Court L.P.A No.626 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
2/4
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE)
Date : 13-10-2025
The appellant-State Health Society has assailed the
order of the learned Single Judge dated 08.10.2024 passed in
CWJC No. 15368 of 2023.
2. Matter was heard at length on 11.09.2025 and we
have passed the following order:-
"Matter heard for some time question
for consideration in the present LPA No. 626 of
2025 is whether respondent is entitled to 100%
back wages or not? In the backdrop of the fact
that he was initially appointed on contract basis
and it was a tenure appointment and it was
extended from time to time. Respondent's service
was terminated on 17.07.2013 on the alleged
allegation that he was involved for certain
criminal offences. He has failed to question the
validity of termination order dated 17.07.2013
within the reasonable period of time. On the other
hand, he had approached this Court for the first
time in filing CWJC No. 14648 of 2018 and it
was dismissed on the ground of delay and latches
on 18.10.2022.
2. Feeling aggrieved by the order of
the learned single judge he preferred LPA No.
687 of 2022 in which LPA Bench proceeded to
dispose of LPA with an observation asking the
respondent to submit representation. He had
submitted representation on 27.04.2023 and it
was rejected on 30.06.2023. Resultantly, he had
filed yet another CWJC No. 15368 of 2023.
3. Learned Single Judge has directed
for reinstatement and allowing 100% back wages.
Appellants have reinstated the Respondent No. 1
- Kanchan Kumar Mishra on 31.01.2025. We
have noticed the conduct of the respondent that
he remained silent from 17.07.2013 till the year
2018 the date on which CWJC No. 14648 of 2018
Patna High Court L.P.A No.626 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
3/4

The State Health Society vs Kanchan Kumar Mishra on 13 October, 2025
was presented. Therefore, for the aforementioned
period he is not entitled to back wages, for the
remaining period from the date of filing CWJC
No. 14648 of 2018 till reinstatement on
31.01.2025
at the best he is entitled to 50% back wages for the reasons that he is not a regular holder of the post,
on the other hand, he was appointed on contract basis against tenure post. This is our prima-facie
views.
4. At this juncture learned counsel for the respondent party in-person Mr. Kanchan Kumar Mishra
seeks time to furnish certain judicial pronouncements to the extent that he is entitled to 100% back
wages. He is permitted to produce those judgments on the next of hearing.
5. Re-list this case on 09.10.2025."
3. Today, respondent party-in-person Mr. Kanchan Kumar Mishra could no satisfy this Court that
he is entitled to more than 50 per cent of the back wages.
4. In the light of these facts and circumstances, the appellant-State Health Society is hereby directed
to pay 50 per cent of the back wages to the respondent-Kanchan Kumar Mishra. To that extent, the
order of the learned Single Judge dated 08.10.2024 passed in CWJC No. 15368 of 2023, stands
modified.
5. Appellant-State Health Society is hereby directed to calculate from the date of filing of CWJC No.
14648 of 2018 till his reinstatement i.e. 31.01.2025 and pay 50 per cent of the back wages to the
respondent-Kanchan Kumar Mishra within a period of four months from today.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.626 of 2025 dt.13-10-2025
6. With the above observation, the LPA stands disposed of.
