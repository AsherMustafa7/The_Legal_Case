ORDER
01.08.2023 Order No. This matter is taken up through hybrid mode.
03.
2. In this petition the Petitioners have prayed for issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash order dated
02.08.2014 of the Additional District Magistrate, Bhubaneswar (Opposite Party No.2) under
Annexure-8.
3. The Petitioners claim that they purchased a portion of the case land from the original lessee Naba
Kishore Sahoo (Opposite Party No.6) vide a registered sale deed dated 11.04.1983. Opposite Party
No.6 being a poor landless person, applied for grant of lease of land measuring Ac.1.000 decimal in
Plot No.647/1627 under Khata No.420(325/35) of Mouza Patharagadia, P.S.-Chandaka in the
district of Khurda. The Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar registered W.L. Lease Case No.1636 of 1974 and by
order dated 11.10.1974 granted lease of the land in favour of Opposite Party No.6.
4. Then after lapse of 24 years, Lease Revision Case No.837 of 1998 was initiated by Opposite Party
No.2-Additional District Magistrate in respect of the aforestated land in exercise of suo motu power
under Section 7- A(3) of the Orissa Government Land Settlement Act, 1962 (OGLS Act). By order
dated 2nd August, 2014, the Additional District Magistrate, Bhubaneswar directed to set aside the
lease granted in favour of Opposite Party No.6 in W.L.L. Case No.1636 of 1974 and further to correct
the records of right (ROR) accordingly. Said order of cancellation of lease is the subject matter of
challenge in the present writ petition.
5. The Petitioners aver that the order granting lease in favour of Opposite Party No.6 in 1974 by the
Tahasildar, Bhubaneswar was granted following due process of law and in the meantime the ROR

has been corrected in favour of the Petitioners after purchase from Opposite Party No.6. Further
Opposite Party No.6 being a landless person, had been granted with the lease in due process of law
and the same had also been recorded in his favour. But Opposite Party No.2 exceeding his
jurisdiction, cancelled the lease after a long period without considering his status as a landless
person even without affording a reasonable opportunity of hearing.
6. Learned counsel for the Petitioners submits that despite clear prohibition under the law to initiate
suo motu revision beyond a period of 14 years, Opposite Party No.2 cancelled the lease on frivolous
grounds.
7. Mr. A.K. Mishra, learned Additional Government Advocate supports the impugned order on the
grounds stated therein.
8. Perusal of the impugned order reveals that, the suo motu revisional power was exercised under
Section 7-A(3) of the OGLS Act to initiate the cancellation proceeding on 2nd August, 2014.
Section 7-A(3) of the OGLS Act has been amended in the year 2013. Prior to amendment it was as
follows:
"7-A. Revision -
xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx (3) The Collector may, of his own motion or otherwise, call for
and examine the records of any proceeding in which any authority, subordinate to it
has passed an order under this Act for the purpose of satisfying himself that any such
order was not passed under a mistake of fact or owing to a fraud or misrepresentation
or on account of any material irregularity of procedure and may pass such order
thereon as he thinks fit.
Provided that no order shall be passed under this subsection unless the person affected by the
proposed order has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the matter: Provided
further that no proceeding under this sub-section shall be initiated after the expiry of fourteen years
from the date of the order."
It was amended w.e.f, 13th November 2013 and the amended provision reads as under:
"(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other law, the Collector
may, on his own motion or otherwise, call for and examine the records of any
proceeding, in which any authority subordinate to him has passed an order under
this Act, for the purpose of satisfying himself that any such order was not passed
under a mistake of facts or owing to a fraud or misrepresentation or on account of
any material irregularity of procedure and may pass such order thereon as he thinks
fit: Provided that no order shall be passed under this subsection unless the person
affected by the proposed order has been given a reasonable opportunity of being
heard in the matter."

9. Admittedly in the present case, the suo motu revision was initiated in 1998 after 24 years of grant
of lease on 11.10.1974. The impugned order is silent regarding the reasons for initiating the suo motu
proceeding after 24 years. Even opportunity of hearing was also not given to the Petitioners before
passing the impugned order.
In the case of Nirmal Kumar Pattnaik v. State of Orissa 2012 (Supp.-II) OLR 450 and Smt. Elley
Pattnaik v. State of Orissa 2012 (Supp.-II) OLR 506, where the suo motu revision under Section
7-A(3) of the Act were initiated beyond 14 years, this Court by applying the second proviso to sub-
Section 3 of Section 7-A have observed that no such proceeding can be initiated after 14 years and
any such proceeding initiated beyond 14 years is unsustainable being without jurisdiction.
10. It is thus clear that, suo motu revision proceeding initiated by the Opposite Party No.2 in 1998 is
barred by law of limitation and any such order, de hors the law of limitation, is not sustainable.
11. The reason assigned in the impugned order that the lessee was not a genuine beneficiary as his
eligibility has not been assessed, is also not found sustainable. It is for the reason that not a single
finding has been made by Opposite Party No.2 in the impugned order to show any ineligibility of the
Petitioners. The learned Revisional Authority has not whispered a single word with regard to annual
family income of the lessee to debar him from the eligibility criteria in his opinion. The doubts
raised by Opposite Party No.2 in the impugned order are not seen substantiated with materials. So
on such baseless assertions, the right enjoyed by the Petitioners for a considerable period of 24 years
cannot be taken away in the guise of suo motu power.
12. In view of the discussions made above, the impugned order dated 2nd August, 2014 under
Annexure-8 is quashed and the writ petition is allowed. No order as to costs.
