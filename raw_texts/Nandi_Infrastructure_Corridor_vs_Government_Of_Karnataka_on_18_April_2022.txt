ASIDE THE IMPUGNED AWARD DATED 22.04.2019 PASSED BY
THE R-4 PRODUCED AT ANNEXURE-A AND ETC.
THESE PETITIONS ARE BEING HEARD AND RESERVED
ON 31.07.2021, COMING ON FOR PRONOUNCEMENT OF
ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:-
18
ORDER
On account of fast development of the cities of Bengaluru and Mysuru, which became leading
centres for Industry, Trade and Commerce attracting tourists from all over the world, the traffic
intensity between Bengaluru and Mysuru increased substantially; taking note of the same and
realising that the traffic intensity will continue to increase with further growth and in order to
ensure smooth and accident free traffic between Bengaluru and Mysuru, an express way between the
two cities was proposed and an infrastructure corridor project technical report was prepared in 1995
which was authorised by the Government of Karnataka vide G.O. dated 20.11.1995. In pursuance of
the same, a consortium consisting of various companies entered into a Memorandum of
Understanding dated 20.02.1995 with the State Government; accordingly, a Framework Agreement
(for short 'FWA') dated 03.04.1997 was entered into between petitioner Nos.1 - Nandi Infrastructure
Corridor Enterprise Limited (for short 'the NICE Ltd.,') and the State Government. As per the said
Agreement, the State Government undertook to acquire about 13,237 acres of land from private
persons and about 6956 acres of Government land, in all, 20,193 acres was agreed to be conveyed
and transferred in favour of NICE Ltd., for implementation of the Bangalore - Mysore Infrastructure
Corridor Project (for short 'the BMICP').
From that time onwards, there have been several litigations on various aspects of the matter in
relation to BMICP. In the year 2019, the SLAO proceeded to pass the impugned awards which are
the subject matter of the present petitions.
2. W.P.No.26085/2019 and W.P.No.31407/2019 are filed by Nandi Infrastructure Corridor
Enterprise Limited and Nandi Economic Corridor Enterprise Limited (for short 'NICE') challenging
the impugned awards. In both the petitions, the State Government is arrayed as 1st respondent and
the KIADB represented by its Chief Executive Officer and Executive Member as 2nd respondent;
The Special Deputy Commissioner - KIADB (BMICP) as well as the Special Land Acquisition
Officers (SLAO -1 and SLAO - 2), KIADB (BMICP) are arrayed as respondents 3 to 5 respectively.
The respondents 6 to 56 are land losers who have been awarded compensation under the impugned
awards. All the respondents have contested both the petitions and have specifically denied the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 18
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
various contentions / claims put forth by NICE.
3. In addition thereto, respondent Nos. 20 to 56 in the aforesaid two petitions have also preferred
the connected W.P.No.1627/2021 challenging some of the impugned awards insofar as the quantum
of compensation awarded in their favour is concerned. It is contended by them that the quantum of
compensation awarded in their favour is inadequate and that the same deserves to be enhanced by
this Court. This petition is contested by NICE which has disputed the various contentions urged by
the land losers.
4. Suffice it to state that in all the three petitions, the legality, validity and correctness of the
impugned awards have been challenged by the respective petitioners and since common questions
of law and fact arise for consideration in all these three petitions, they are taken up together and
disposed of by this common order.
5. Briefly stated, the contentions put forth by the petitioners in W.P.No.26085/2019 and
W.P.No.31407/2019 are as under:-
5.1 The petitioners contend that the acquisition of lands for the purpose of BMICP
was unsuccessfully challenged before this Court on several occasions and rejected
vide order dated 21.09.1998 in H.T.Somashekar Reddy's case which was confirmed
by the Apex Court on 26.03.1999. Thereafter, the FWA and BMICP was once again
challenged by J.C.Madhuswamy & others which was rejected by this Court vide order
dated 03.05.2005 which was confirmed by the Apex Court vide order dated
20.04.2006; subsequently, the review petitions filed by the said persons as well as
the State Government and its instrumentalities was also rejected by this Court on
02.11.2006.
5.2 It is contended that the appeal filed by one M.Nagabhushana for challenging
acquisition of the lands was dismissed by the Apex Court on 02.02.2011 holding that
the BMICP was in public interest and that the State should not do anything to release
the land acquired for the project and to implement the same expeditiously.
Subsequently, vide order dated 15.06.2011, one more batch of petitions challenging the land
acquisition was dismissed by the Division Bench of this Court. It is contended that despite the
aforesaid facts and circumstances, the State Government took a inimical stand against BMICP and
attempted to scuttle its implementation, on account of which, contempt proceedings are pending
before the Apex Court.
5.3 Petitioners contend that since the respondents did not take any steps to pass awards, petitioners
filed W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 before this Court for directions to the respondents to pass awards in
respect of lands measuring about 344 acres, of which, possession had already been handed over to
the petitioners; however, the two SLAOs - KIADB, the respondents 4 and 5 herein had failed and
neglected to pass awards and pay compensation to the land owners. It is contended that though
preliminary notifications under Section 28(1) of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 19
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
1966 (for short 'the KIAD Act') had been issued between 19.12.1998 and 23.02.2009 and final
notifications were issued between 18.02.2003 and 02.06.2009, awards were not passed by the
respondents.
5.4 It is contended that vide order dated 29.11.2013, this Court allowed the petitions filed by the
petitioners and directed the SLAOs to pass awards within a period of six months; in the said order,
the contention of the respondents that the subject lands were excess lands was rejected. The said
order was challenged before the Apex Court in SLP (C) Nos.8858-8859/2015, which was dismissed
as withdrawn on 01.07.2015 . Subsequently, review petition in R.P.No.310/2016 was filed by the
State Government which was also dismissed by this Court vide order dated 02.12.2016.
5.5 Petitioners contend that they initiated contempt proceedings in CCC Nos.1663-64/2014 on
account of non compliance with the orders / directions of this Court. Meanwhile, the respondents 4
and 5 filed I.A.1/2014 and I.A.2/2014 in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 seeking extension of time which
was granted by this Court by extending the time up to 31.03.2015 to pass awards, pursuant to which,
the petitioners withdrew the contempt proceedings with liberty to file a fresh petition if the need
arose.
5.6 Subsequently, on 31.03.2015, respondents 4 and 5 - SLAOs filed I.A.1/2015 in W.P.Nos.35638-
639/2012 seeking further extension of time but the said applications were not pressed by them.
Since the respondents 4 and 5 failed to comply with the orders even thereafter, petitioners filed CCC
No.615/2015 before this Court. In the said contempt proceedings, respondents 4 and 5 filed counter
Affidavit putting forth false, frivolous and untenable contentions and sought to raise inflated
demands on the petitioners for deposit of money to be utilised towards disbursement of
compensation. The petitioners filed their detailed response and the matter was posted for hearing
regarding framing of charge. On 04.10.2016, respondents 4 and 5 filed I.A.2/2016 in
W.P.Nos.35368-369/2012 seeking certain clarifications regarding money to be deposited. The said
application was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 27.10.2017 issuing several directions in
favour of the several petitioners. Thereafter, respondents 4 and 5 commenced the exercise of passing
of awards during the period March 2018 to June 2018 in respect of lands measuring about 194 acres
out of the total extent of 344 acres; the compensation arrived at for acquisition of the aforesaid 194
acres was about Rs.53.72 crores.
5.7 The petitioners contend that the aforesaid awards were forwarded by the SLAOs to the Special
D.C. - KIADB for approval, who in turn forwarded the same to the KIADB, who also forwarded the
same to respondent Nos.1
- State for formal approval vide letter dated 03.11.2018. Thereafter, vide letter dated 13.11.2018,
respondent Nos.2
- KIADB withdrew the said letter dated 03.11.2018 on the ground that the note of the Chief Secretary
dated 05.11.2018 indicates that if the awards were passed as directed by this Court, the stand of the
State Government regarding excess land before the Apex Court in the pending contempt
proceedings would be weakened which would enable the petitioners to argue that there was no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 20
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
excess land acquired for the project; the said letter dated 13.11.2018 also states that further steps in
the matter would be taken after obtaining opinion of the learned Advocate General; the note of the
Chief Secretary records the directions issued by this Court in the aforesaid petitions to pass awards
and that there was delay in passing the awards.
5.8 Petitioners contend that they have filed I.A.1/2018 to implead the CEO of KIADB as accused
No.3 in the contempt proceedings and the matter was heard by this Court with the learned Advocate
General representing respondents 4 and 5 - SLAOs, who sought time to pass awards in compliance
with the earlier judgments of this Court and the same was recorded by the contempt court vide
order dated 09.04.2019. Subsequently, the impugned awards have been passed which are assailed in
the present petitions.
5.9 Petitioners contend that earlier proposed awards sent for approval vide letter dated 03.11.2018
of KIADB were passed in accordance with law and compensation had been determined based on the
market value of the lands as on the date of the preliminary notification and the said awards ought to
have been approved; instead as against the initial liability of Rs.53.72 crores for 194 acres, the
liability of the petitioners to pay compensation as per the impugned awards comes to Rs.565.30
crores for 242 acres 11.87 guntas. Aggrieved by the impugned awards whereby the petitioners are
called upon to pay higher compensation, the petitioners are before this Court by way of present
petitions.
6. The 1st respondent - State Government has filed its statement of objections opposing the petitions
inter alia contending that the petitioners are not the beneficiaries of the subject acquisition and the
petitioners do not have any locus standi to challenge the award and that the petitions are liable to be
dismissed. It is contended that Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short 'the L.A.Act')
mandates that an award shall be made only with the previous / prior approval of the State
Government; in this context, it is stated that the awards passed in the year 2018 had not received
any approval and that the same were not awards in the eye of law; it is submitted that so long as the
said awards proposed in 2018 did not receive approval of the State Government as required in law
and the awards are not deemed to have been passed and as such, it is not open for the petitioners to
place reliance of the unapproved / draft / proposed awards, which do not have any value in law.
6.1 It is submitted that Section 13-A of the said Act of 1894 is also applicable only to valid and
effective awards which are duly passed after obtaining prior approval from the State Government
and consequently, the awards of the year 2018 cannot be relied upon by the petitioners. The
impugned awards fixing and quantifying the compensation by shifting the date from the date of the
preliminary notifications commencing from the year 1998 were issued to achieve a just, fair and
equitable compensation as per the law laid down by the Apex Court.
6.2 In addition to specifically denying the various allegations and claim made by the petitioners, the
1st respondent has contended that the impugned awards have been passed in accordance with law,
there is no violation of statutory provisions, no abdication of statutory duty nor any mala fides
attributable to the State Government and that the present petitions are liable to be dismissed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 21
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
7. In its statement of objections, respondents 2 to 5 - KIADB have put forth similar defences; in
addition thereto, it is contended that as per the decisions referred to in the statement of objections,
the petitioners do not have locus standi to challenge the impugned awards which have been passed
in terms of Sections 29 and 30 of the KIAD Act. It is reiterated that the awards proposed in 2018
have not been approved and the same cannot be relied upon by the petitioners. It is also submitted
that having regard to the specific opinion tendered by the learned Advocate General in his opinion
dated 16.04.2019, it became imperative for the KIADB to pass the impugned awards which are just
and proper having regard to the enormous delay in passing the awards. It is also contended that an
award is only an offer and the award proceedings are merely administrative in nature and not
judicial proceedings, particularly when the land losers are entitled to seek enhancement / re-
determination of the award amounts. It is therefore contended that the respondents 2 to 5 - KIADB
were fully justified in passing the impugned awards which do not warrant interference in the present
petitions.
8. The private respondents - land losers have controverted the various allegations and claim put
forth by NICE and have sought to support the impugned awards; as stated supra, in addition
thereto, the respondents 20 to 56 who have also preferred W.P.No.1627/2021, sought for
enhancement of compensation awarded under the impugned awards. It is relevant to state that
apart from disputing the various contentions put forth by the State, KIADB and the private
respondents, NICE has also opposed the claim of the land losers, respondents 20 to 56 who are the
petitioners in W.P.No.1627/2021.
9. The petitioners have filed a common rejoinder and have contended that the issue regarding locus
standi on the part of the petitioners was raised by the respondents earlier and rejected by this Court
and as such, the said contention urged by the respondents is liable to be rejected. It is contended
that the decision of the Apex Court in Peerappa Hanamanthappa Harijan vs. State of Karnataka &
others - (2015) 10 SCC 469 and Satish Kumar Gupta vs. State of Haryana - (2017) 4 SCC 760 are not
applicabl, in view of the Agreements having been entered into between the petitioners and
respondents 1 and 2 prior to the acquisition notifications and on this ground also, petitioners have
locus standi to challenge the impugned awards.
9.1 Petitioners have also denied and disputed the various contentions urged by respondents 1 to 5
with regard to the awards of the year 2018 and referred to the documents in this regard. It is
reiterated that the query referred to the learned Advocate General was only with regard to whether
the stand of the State Government before the Apex Court would be affected, if awards are passed
and there was no scope for the learned Advocate General to render any opinion with regard to
fixation of the compensation and the opinion of the learned Advocate General with regard to
fixation of higher compensation by shifting the date to be reckoned from the date of the preliminary
notification to a subsequent date was beyond the scope and ambit of the opinion sought for from the
learned Advocate General. It is therefore contended that the impugned awards which are based on
the opinion of the learned Advocate General are arbitrary and illegal and deserve to be quashed.
9.2 It is contended that since the delay in passing the awards is solely and fully attributable to the
respondents 1 to 5, the question of the petitioners being liable to pay compensation as per the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 22
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
impugned awards will not arise. It is also contended that the SLAO being a delegatee of the State
Government exercises quasi judicial powers while passing the awards and the contention of the
respondents that award proceedings are merely administrative in nature is incorrect. It is further
contended that having regard to the fact that the delay is attributable only to the respondents 1 to 5,
the impugned awards which revise the compensation by shift / postponing the relevant date from
the date of the preliminary notification to a later date is clearly illegal, mala fide and arbitrary.
9.3 The petitioners, in addition to specifically denying the various contentions urged in the
statement of objections have also reiterated the facts, grounds, and contentions urged in the
petitions and have contended that they are entitled to relief sought for in the petitions.
10. Heard the learned Senior counsel for the petitioners and the learned Senior counsel and other

13. After having heard the learned Senior counsel and counsel for the parties, the following points
arise for consideration:-
" (i) Whether the petitioners do not have locus standi to maintain the present petition
as contended by the respondents?
(ii) Whether the petition involving contractual matters is maintainable before this
Court?
(iii) Whether the impugned awards are just, legal and proper?"
14. Before adverting to the rival contentions, it is necessary to refer to the undisputed facts leading
to the present petitions, which are as under:-
(i) On 03.04.1997, FWA was entered into between petitioners and 1st respondent -
State for implementation of the BMIC Project; subsequently, on 14.10.1998,
petitioners have entered into an Agreement in this regard with the KIADB.
(ii) During the period from 19.12.1998 to 23.03.2009, preliminary notifications were
issued by the State under Section 28(1) of the KIAD Act in an extent of 344 acres.
(iii) Between 18.02.2003 and 02.06.2009, final notifications under Section 28(4) of
KIAD Act were issued.
(iv) Between 18.10.2003 and 19.07.2012, possession of the lands were taken by
KIADB and handed over to petitioner No.2 vide possession certificates.
(v) On 01.07.2009, petitioners issues a letter to KIADB requesting them to pay
compensation by passing awards; since KIADB does not pass any awards, one more
letter dated 16.03.2012 was written by petitioners to KIADB.
(vi) Since no awards were passed, W.P.Nos.35638-
639/2012 were filed by the petitioners seeking directions to the SLAOs - KIADB to pass awards; on
29.11.2013, this Court allowed the said petitions and directed the SLAOs - KIADB to pass awards
within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the copy of the order.
(vii) I.A.1/2014 and I.A.2/2014 were filed by the SLAOs - KIADB in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012
seeking extension of time stipulated in the aforesaid order dated 29.11.2013; on 18.12.2014, this
Court extended the period up to 31.03.2015; the contempt proceedings initiated by the petitioners in
CCC Nos.1663-1664/2014 were withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh petition, if the need so arose.

enormous delay in passing the awards; KIADB forwarded the opinion to the Special Deputy
Commissioner (BMICP) and SLAOs - KIDAB directing them to pass the awards as per the opinion of
the learned Advocate General.
(xvii) On 22.04.2019, the SLAOs wrote letters to the Special Deputy Commissioner (BMICP) raising

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 26
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
of awards already passed by them and sent for approval on 03.11.2018; in response to the said
letters, the CEO of KIADB once again addresses a letter dated 22.04.2019 to the Special Deputy
Commissioner (BMICP) and the SLAO - KIADB instructing them to pass the awards as directed in
the letter dated 16.04.2019.

Government on 23.04.2019.
(xix) On 04.05.2019, 5th respondent - SLAO passed the impugned award in respect of 115 acres
38.23 guntas amounting to Rs.157.43 crores and sent the same for approval to the State Government
on 08.05.2019.
(xx) On 24.05.2019, the State Government granted approval for the said awards, subject to the
condition that the KIADB would be responsible and liable for payment of compensation of
Rs.565,30,55,768/- in respect of 242 acres 11.87 guntas;
(xxi) The legality, validity and correctness of the aforesaid awards have been assailed in the present
petitions.
In the backdrop of the aforesaid undisputed facts and circumstances, the points formulated above
are taken up for consideration.
Re-Point No.1:-
15. The first question that arises for consideration is, whether the petitioners have
locus standi to challenge the impugned awards in the present petitions.
15.1 As stated supra, W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 were filed by the petitioners seeking a
direction to the respondents therein i.e., the State Government and KIADB to pass
awards pursuant to the acquisition notifications. In the said petitions, the
respondents herein took up an identical defence with regard to the petitioners not
having locus standi to maintain the writ petitions. This contention has been noticed
by this Court in its final order dated 29.11.2013, wherein, at paragraph-14, this Court
has referred to the said contention regarding lack / want of locus standi urged by the
respondents and has come to the conclusion at paragraph-26 of the order that the
petitioners herein are the beneficiaries of the acquisition since the land has been
acquired for BMICP project and has recorded a categorical finding that the
petitioners have locus standi to maintain the writ petitions. The said finding recorded
by this Court is as under:-
" 14. As against this, the learned counsel for the respondents-1 to 4 submitted that
petitioners have no locus standi to maintain the writ petitions. Inviting our attention
to Section 29 of the KIADB Act, the learned counsel for the respondents 1 to 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 27
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
submitted that petitioners are not interested persons and they have no locus standi to
maintain the writ petitions. He also submitted that awarding of compensation is a
matter between the State and land owners and the petitioners have nothing to do
with it. He placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in
(2010) 14 SCC page 285 WEST BENGAL STATE WAREHOUSING CORPORATION
vs INDRAPURI STUDIO PRIVATE LIMITED & ANOTHER to contend that the
petitioners are not interested persons and therefore, they have no locus standi to
maintain the writ petitions. He also submitted that the Secretary to PWD
department, Government of Karnataka has filed an affidavit before the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in contempt proceedings stating that excess of 554 acres of land has
been handed over and it is contrary to the frame work agreement. Since the matter is
seized before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, this court cannot direct the respondents to
pass the awards. He also submitted that the decisions relied upon by the learned
counsel for the petitioners do not apply to the fact situation of the present case.
Therefore, the writ petitions may be dismissed.
15. The learned counsel for the applicants in I.A.Nos.1/2013, 2/2013 & 3/2013
contended that impleading applicants are necessary parties to the proceedings and
therefore, they may be impleaded. It was also contended that an affidavit has been
filed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court stating that excess of land has been handed
over and the lands of the applicants are not required for the project and Civil Appeals
are pending before Hon'ble Supreme Court and therefore, the applicants may be
impleaded as parties to the proceedings.
16. The learned counsel for the respondents-2 & 3 submitted that PWD is a necessary
party to the proceedings being a nodal agency and therefore, it may be impleaded as
party to the proceedings.
17. We have carefully considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties.
18. The points that arise for our consideration are:
(i) Whether I.A.Nos.1/2013, 2/2013, 3/2013 & 4/2013 need to be allowed?
(ii) Whether the respondents-3 & 4 can to be directed to pass the awards?
POINT NO. 1:
19. I.A.Nos.1/2013, 2/2013 & 3/2013 have been filed by the applicants who are the land owners to
implead them as parties to the proceedings. I.A.No.4/2013 has been filed by the respondents 2 and 3
to implead PWD as party to the proceedings. The applicant in I.A.No.1/2013 is the owner of
Sy.No.64/1 measuring 3 acres 1 gunta of Gottigere village. The applicant in I.A.No.2/2013 is the
owner of Sy.No.44/1 measuring 2 acres 23 guntas of Madavara village. The applicant in
I.A.No.3/2013 is the owner of Sy.No.34/3 measuring 1 acre 18 guntas of Doddathogur village. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 28
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
lands of the applicants have been acquired for BMIC project. Possession has been handed over. The
applicant in I.A.No.1/2013 has preferred Civil Appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal
No.761/2013. However, there is no stay or any other interim order restraining not to pass any
award. The land has been acquired and acquisition proceedings have been upheld and there is no
stay restraining not to pass any award. Therefore, in our considered view, the presence of the
applicants is not required to consider the relief claimed in the writ petitions. Therefore,
I.A.Nos.1/2013, 2/2013 & 3 /2013 are hereby rejected. Similarly, PWD is not a necessary party to the
proceedings. Accordingly, I.A.No.4/2013 is hereby rejected.
POINT NO.2:
20. Insofar as the question as to whether the respondents-3 & 4 can to be directed to
pass the awards is concerned, it is not in dispute that 344 acres of land mentioned in
Annexure-A has been acquired for BMIC project. It is also not in dispute that
possession of the land has been handed over to the petitioners. The acquisition
proceedings have been concluded upto the Apex Court.
21. It was contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that Secretary, PWD
department has filed an affidavit before the Hon'ble Supreme Court stating that
excess of land has been handed over. The contention regarding excess of land has
been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M.NAGABHUSHANA vs. STATE
OF KARNATAKA AND OTHERS reported in 2011(3) SCC page 408.
Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed as follows:
"38. In that view of the matter, this Court makes it clear that the State Government
should complete the project as early as possible and should not do anything,
including releasing any land acquired under this project, as that may impede the
completion of the project and would not be compatible with the larger public interest
which the project is intended to serve."
Similarly, in contempt proceedings No.144/2006 in Civil Appeal Nos.3492-3294/2005, the Hon'ble
Supreme court has observed that no land shall be denotified by the State Government until further
orders. Therefore, it is clear that the contention regarding excess of land has been considered by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court. Absolutely there is nothing on record to show as to which is that excess of
land that has been handed over. It is stated, about 554 acres of land has been handed over in excess.
The land involved in this case is about 344 acres. In the absence of any material to show with regard
to excess of land handed over. It is difficult to accept the contention of the respondents and
accordingly, it is rejected.
22. The Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the petitioners have no locus standi to
maintain the writ petitions. He placed reliance on the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court reported
in (2010) 14 SCC page 285 WEST BENGAL STATE WAREHOUSING CORPORATION vs
INDRAPURI STUDIO PRIVATE LIMITED & ANOTHER.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 29
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
23. As against this, the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that petitioners being the
beneficiaries are interested persons and therefore, they can maintain the writ petitions.
24. In WEST BENGAL STATE WAREHOUSING CORPORATION Vs INDRAPURI STUDIO
PRIVATE LIMITED AND ANOTHER (2010) 14 SC 285), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considering
Section 2(d) of the West Bengal Premises Requisition and Control (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1947
has held that beneficiaries have no locus standi to participate in the process of determination of
compensation. However, in the decisions relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioners namely
HIMALAYAN TILES AND MARBLE PRIVATE LIMITED V/S FRANCIS VICTOR COUTINHO
reported in (1980) 3 SCC page 223, NEELANGANGABAI & ANOTHER vs STATE OF KARNATAKA
& OTHERS reported in (1990)3 SCC page 617, N KRISHNAMACHARI vs MANAGING DIRECTOR,
APSRTC, HYDERABAD & OTHERS reported in (1994)6 SCC page 74, NEYVELY LIGNITE
CORPORATION LIMITED vs SPECIAL TAHSILDAR (LA) reported in (1995)1 SCC page 221 and
DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY vs BHOLA NATH SHARMA & OTHERS reported in (2011)2
SCC page 54, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considering the provisions of Land Acquisition Act has
held that beneficiaries are interested persons and they have locus standi.
25. Section 2(11) of the KIADB Act provides that the expression 'land' and expression 'persons
interested' have the same meaning assigned to them in Section 3 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984.
26. Section 3(1) of the Land Acquisition Act defines the expression 'person interested' as follows:
"3(1):- The expression "person interested"
includes all person claiming an interest in compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of
land under this Act; and a person shall be deemed to be interested in land if he is interested in an
easement affecting the land;"
Considering this provision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the person
interested includes beneficiaries of acquisition also. Therefore, there is no merit in
the contention that the beneficiaries are not interested persons and they cannot
maintain the writ petitions. The land has been acquired for BMIC project. The
petitioners are the beneficiaries. They have to pay the compensation, acquisition
expenses and interest for the delayed period. Therefore, it cannot be said that the
petitioners have no locus standi to maintain the writ petitions. Accordingly, it is
rejected".
15.2 It is an undisputed fact that the said judgment of this Court in the earlier round of litigation
inter-parties in respect of the very same subject matter has attained finality and become conclusive
and binding upon the State as well as the KIADB, whose contentions that the petitioners are not the
beneficiaries and that they do not have locus standi have been rejected by this Court and
consequently, the said findings operate as res judicata and places an embargo on the respondents to
re-agitate and put forth the very same contentions all over again in the present petitions, which is
clearly contrary to public policy and principles of res judicata. Under these circumstances, it is clear
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 30
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
that in the light of the findings recorded in W.P.Nos.35638-638/2012, the petitioners herein have
locus standi to maintain the present petitions on this ground alone.
15.3 A perusal of the material on record will also indicate that the various undisputed facts and
circumstances which cumulatively establish that the petitioners are the beneficiaries of the
acquisition and that they are not post acquisition allottees are as under:
• The Frame Work Agreement dated 03.04.1997 entered into between petitioners and
the State as well as the Agreement dated 14.10.1998 between petitioners and KIADB,
both prior to the preliminary notifications indicate that the land was acquired for the
purpose of the petitioners' BMIC Project.
• The covenants in the aforesaid Agreements that lands would be acquired for the
purpose of the BMIC project of the petitioners.
• The various Government Orders including the orders dated 18.01.1997, 30.04.1997
and 04.07.1998, whereby various posts were created comprising of the Special
Deputy Commissioners, SLAOs, Staff etc., exclusively dedicated and appointed for
the purpose of BMIC project.
• The acquired land were handed over solely and exclusively to the petitioners and
not any one else; in other words, the entire extent of land acquired under the subject
acquisition was handed over only to the petitioners and no portion of acquired land
was handed over or given / granted in favour of any one else. • Except issuing
possession certificates thereby handing over possession of the acquired lands to the
petitioners, no allotment letter, lease-cum-sale agreement etc., which created right in
favour of the petitioners, post agreements were executed thereby indicating that the
entire acquisition was for the benefit of the petitioners. • Reference to BMIC Project
in the preliminary and final notifications as well as the awards also indicate that the
land was acquired for the benefit of the petitioners. • The mutual conduct of the
petitioners, State Government and KIADB pre- acquisition and post - acquisition also
indicate that both the State Government and KIADB have throughout held and
represented that the lands were acquired for the benefit of the petitioners. 15.4 In the
case of Himalayan Tiles (supra), the Apex Court held as under:-
8. It seems to us that the definition of "a person interested" given in Section 18 is an
inclusive definition and must be liberally construed so as to embrace all persons who
may be directly or indirectly interested either in the title to the land or in the
quantum of compensation. In the instant case, it is not disputed that the lands were
actually acquired for the purpose of the company and once the land vested, in the
Government, after acquisition, it stood transferred to the company under the
agreement entered into between the company and the Government. Thus, it cannot
be said that the company had no claim or title to the land at all. Secondly, since under
the agreement the company had to pay the compensation, it was most certainly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 31
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
interested in seeing that a proper quantum of compensation was fixed so that the
company may not have to pay a very heavy amount of money. For this purpose, the
company could undoubtedly appear and adduce evidence on the question of the
quantum of compensation.
9. So far as this aspect of matter is concerned, there appears to be a general
consensus of judicial opinion that even though the company may not have any title to
the property yet it certainly has a right to appear and put forward its case in the
matter of determination of the quantum of compensation. In the case of Sunder Lal v.
Paramsukhdas [AIR 1968 SC 366 :
(1968) 1 SCR 362 : (1968) 1 SCJ 685] this Court observed as follows:
"It will be noticed that it is an inclusive definition. It is not necessary that in order to
fall within the definition a person should claim an interest in land, which has been
acquired. A person becomes a person interested if he claims an interest in
compensation to be awarded. It seems to us that Paramsukhdas is a "person
interested" within Section 3(b) of the Act because he claims an interest in
compensation . . . .
It seems to us that Paramsukhdas was clearly a person interested in the objections
which were pending before the court in the references made to it and that he was also
a person whose interest would be affected by the objections, within Section 21. He
was accordingly entitled to be made a party."
10. In the case of Hindustan Sanitary-ware and Industries Ltd., Bahadurgarh v. State of Haryana
[AIR 1972 P&H 59] Pandit, J. observed as follows:
"From the facts stated above, it is apparent that the compensation amount has to be
paid by the two companies. If the said amount is increased by the learned Additional
District Judge on a reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, it would
be the two companies, who would be prejudiced. . . . No authority even was cited by
him that under similar circumstances any court had ever held that the persons, who
had actually to pay the compensation, could not be allowed to lead evidence and say
that the compensation amount be not enhanced."
11. In the case of Comilla Electric Supply Ltd. v. East Bengal Bank Ltd., Comilla [AIR 1939 Cal 669 :
43 CWN 973 : (1939) 2 ILR 401 : 186 IC 17] while the High Court took the view that the company for
whose benefit the land was acquired may not strictly be an interested person yet it had undoubtedly
a right to appear and adduce evidence on the quantum of compensation. In this connection,
Mukherjea, J., observed thus:
"Section 50, clause (2) purports to remedy this disability and it lays down that in any
proceeding held before a Collector or court in such cases the local authority or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 32
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
company concerned may appear and adduce evidence for the purpose of determining
the amount of compensation. The reason is plain. It is the company or the local
authority who has got to pay the money in such cases and it would be unjust to deny
them the right to appear and adduce evidence which would have a bearing on the
amount of the compensation money."
Roxburgh, J. made the observations:
"Thus the first question for decision is clearly settled by the above decision and there
can be no doubt that in the circumstances at present being considered the company is
a person interested, as defined in the Act, and is entitled to require a reference under
Section 18 unless that right is restricted by the terms of the proviso to Section 50(2)."
12. In the case of M. Kuppuswami v. Special Tahsildar (L. A.) II Industrial Estate, Ambathur at
Saidapet, Madras [(1967) 1 MLJ 329] Venkatadri, J. interpreting the definition of "interested
person"
observed as follows:
"The only question for consideration therefore is whether the petitioner is a person
interested as defined in Section 3(b) of the Land Acquisition Act.
The definition section says that the expression 'person interested' includes all persons
claiming an interest in compensation to be made on account of the acquisition of land
under the Act. The expression 'person interested, is very comprehensive and it does
not profess to give an exhaustive definition. The expression 'person interested' has
been interpreted by various courts, and the trend of the opinion seems to be that I
should give a liberal interpretation. . . .
On a review of the case-law on the subject, it seems to me that the expression 'person
interested' does not require that a person must really have an interest in the land
sought to be acquired. It is enough if he claims an interest in compensation, as
distinguished from an interest in the property sought to be acquired. As long as a
person claims an interest in the compensation, he is a person interested within the
meaning of the definition of that expression."
13. The only case which appears to have taken a contrary view is a Division Bench decision of the
Orissa High Court in the case of State of Orissa through the Land Acquisition Collector, Sambalpur
v. Amarandra Pratap Singh [AIR 1967 Ori 180 : ILR 1967 Cut 510] where the High Court held that
the expression "person interested" did not include a local authority or a company on whose behalf
acquisition is made by the State. At the same time, it was clearly held that it was open to the
company in any proceeding before the Collector or court to appear and adduce evidence for the
purpose of determining the amount of compensation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 33
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
14. Thus, the preponderance of judicial opinion seems to favour the view that the definition of
"person interested" must be liberally construed so as to include a body, local authority, or a
company for whose benefit the land is acquired and who is bound under an agreement to pay the
compensation. In our opinion, this view accords with the principles of equity, justice and good
conscience. How can it be said that a person for whose benefit the land is acquired and who is to pay
the compensation is not a person interested even though its stake may be extremely vital? For
instance, the land acquisition proceedings may be held to be invalid and thus a person concerned is
completely deprived of the benefit which is proposed to be given to him. Similarly, if such a person
is not heard by the Collector or a court, he may have to pay a very heavy compensation which, in
case he is allowed to appear before a court, he could have satisfied it that the compensation was far
too heavy having regard to the nature and extent of the land. We are, therefore, unable to agree with
the view taken by the Orissa High Court or even by the Calcutta High Court that a company, local
authority or a person for whose benefit the land is acquired is not an interested person. We are
satisfied that such a person is vitally interested both in the title to the property as also in the
compensation to be paid therefor because both these factors concern its future course of action and
if decided against him, seriously prejudice his rights. Moreover, in view of the decision of this Court
referred to above, we hold that the appellant was undoubtedly a person interested as contemplated
by Section 18(1) of the Act. The High Court, therefore, committed an error in throwing out the
appeal of the appellant on the ground that it had no locus to file an appeal before the Bench. 15.5 As
held by the Apex Court in the aforesaid judgment coupled with the FWA and Agreement as well as
other circumstances referred to above, in particular, the decision of this Court in
W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012, I am of the considered opinion that the petitioners are the beneficiaries
of the subject acquisition and that they have locus standi to maintain the present petitions.
15.6 The material on record indicates that the petitioners have sufficient locus standi to file the
present petitions, since they are the beneficiaries of the subject acquisition which has been
recognised, confirmed and upheld by this Court in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 dated 29.11.2013 and
the said finding having attained finality and become conclusive and binding upon the respondents,
the petitioners have sufficient locus standi; the decisions of the Apex Court in Peerappa's case and
Satish Kumar Gupta's case are not applicable to the facts of the instant case, particularly when the
petitioners was not a post acquisition allottee but a beneficiary who had entered into agreements
with the State Government as well as KIADB prior to the preliminary notification coupled with the
other material on record which indicates that the subject lands under the impugned awards were
acquired pursuant to the said agreements and for the sole and exclusive benefit of petitioners and
not any one else and consequently, the petitioners have locus standi to file the present petitions.
15.7 Insofar as the reliance placed by the respondents on Peerappa's case (supra), in order to
contend that it is the KIADB which is the beneficiary and not the petitioners herein is concerned, the
said judgment is not applicable to the facts of the instant case for the simple reason that the
judgment in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 was rendered inter-parties on 29.11.2013 prior to the
decision in Peerappa's case (supra), which was rendered on 30.07.2015; so also, the facts obtaining
in Peerappa's case were completely different from the facts of the instant case and the judgment of
the Apex Court in Himalayan Tiles' case (supra) has been distinguished in Peerappa's case entirely
on facts; under these circumstances, having regard to the peculiar and special facts obtaining in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 34
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
instant case, which are distinguishable from the facts in Peerappa's case, I am of the considered
opinion that the judgment of the Apex Court in Peerappa's case is not applicable to the facts of the
instant case.
15.8 Similarly, the judgment of the Apex Court in Satish Kumar's case (supra) was also rendered in
the context of a post-acquisition allottee who had not entered into any pre-acquisition agreements,
transactions etc., with either the State Government or the statutory authority and consequently,
even this judgment rendered in a completely different fact situation cannot be said to be applicable
to the facts and circumstances of the case on hand and consequently, no reliance can be placed on
this judgment to come to the conclusion that the petitioners do not have locus standi to maintain the
present petitions.
In view of the aforesaid discussion, Point No.1 is answered in favour of the petitioners by holding
that they are the beneficiaries of the acquisition and that they have locus standi to maintain the
present petitions.
Re-Point No.2:-
16. The next question that arises for consideration is, whether the present petitions relating to issues
involving contractual matters i.e., the FWA dated 03.04.1997 and the Agreement dated 14.10.1998
entered into between the petitioners, the State and the KIADB respectively, is maintainable as
contended by the respondents.
16.1 In this context, it is relevant to state that this very defence with regard to maintainability of the
petitions was urged by the respondents in the earlier round of litigation which culminated before the
Apex Court in the case of All India Manufacturers's case (supra), wherein, the Apex Court held as
under:-
The relief granted by the High Court
58. One final argument was made by Mr Divan as regards the relief granted by the
High Court. To appreciate the argument, it is necessary to look at the relief granted in
terms of para 42.2, which is as follows:
"Writ Petitions Nos. 45334 and 48981 of 2004 are allowed directing the State of
Karnataka and all its instrumentalities including the Board to forthwith execute the
Project as conceived originally and upheld by this Court in Somashekar Reddy case
[(1999) 1 KLD 500 : (2000) 1 Kant LJ 224 (DB)] and implement the FWA in letter
and spirit. Consequently, government orders dated 4-11-2004 and 17-12-2004
constituting the Review Committee and Expert Committee are quashed. The report
submitted by these committees in pursuance to these orders and all subsequent
actions taken incidental thereto are also quashed. Nandi is also directed to
implement the Project as expeditiously as possible. Parties will bear their own costs
in these two cases."

59. Mr Divan strongly urged that the relief granted was wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, as it would amount to granting a decree for specific
performance in writ jurisdiction. A reading of the relief granted by the High Court does not persuade
us that it is so. The High Court merely directed that the Project and the FWA, as conceived originally
and upheld by the High Court in Somashekar Reddy [(1999) 1 KLD 500 : (2000) 1 Kant LJ 224
(DB)] , should be implemented "in letter and spirit". In other words, the High Court said that there
is no scope for raising frivolous and mala fide objections for ulterior purposes. This, the High Court
was fully entitled to do. It is trite law that when one of the contracting parties is "State" within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, it does not cease to enjoy the character of "State" and,
therefore, it is subjected to all the obligations that "State" has under the Constitution. When the
State's acts of omission or commission are tainted with extreme arbitrariness and with mala fides, it
is certainly subject to interference by the constitutional courts in this country. We may refer to
Gujarat State Financial Corpn. v. Lotus Hotels (P) Ltd. [(1983) 3 SCC 379] in which a statutory
corporation (the Gujarat State Financial Corporation) arbitrarily refused to grant the sanction of
loans to entrepreneurs who had already acted on the basis of the sanction and had incurred
expenditure and liabilities. The argument that the transaction was purely a contractual arrangement
between the parties and, therefore, not amenable to writ jurisdiction, was categorically rejected by
the following observations:
"13. Now if appellant entered into a solemn contract in discharge and performance of
its statutory duty and the respondent acted upon it, the statutory corporation cannot
be allowed to act arbitrarily so as to cause harm and injury, flowing from its
unreasonable conduct, to the respondent. In such a situation, the Court is not
powerless from holding the appellant to its promise and it can be enforced by a writ
of mandamus directing it to perform its statutory duty. A petition under Article 226
of the Constitution would certainly lie to direct performance of a statutory duty by
'other authority' as envisaged by Article 12." [Ibid., at p. 387, para 13, per D.A. Desai,
J.]
60.Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. [(1991) 1 SCC 212 : 1991 SCC (L&S) 742] is another authority
for the proposition that the State Government has to act reasonably and without arbitrariness even
with regard to the exercise of its contractual rights. [Ibid., at pp. 235-43] In Dwarkadas Marfatia and
Sons v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay [(1989) 3 SCC 293 :
AIR 1989 SC 1642] the situation was one in which a lease between the Bombay Port
Trust and certain parties was terminated in exercise of contractual rights and the
lease rent was abnormally increased. It was held that there was always an obligation
on the part of public authorities in their acts of omission and commission to be
reasonable. In Biman Krishna Bose v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. [(2001) 6 SCC
477] the question was whether an insurance company could arbitrarily and
unreasonably refuse the renewal of a policy. Considering that the insurance company,
as a result of State monopoly in the insurance sector, had become "State" under
Article 12 of the Constitution, this Court held that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 36
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
"... it [the insurance company] requires (sic) to satisfy the requirement of
reasonableness and fairness while dealing with the customers. Even in an area of
contractual relations, the State and its instrumentalities are enjoined with the
obligations to act with fairness and in doing so, can take into consideration only the
relevant materials. They must not take any irrelevant and extraneous consideration
while arriving at a decision. Arbitrariness should not appear in their actions or
decisions." [Ibid., at p. 481, para 3, per V.N. Khare, J.]
61. Thus, it appears that no exception could be taken to relief granted in the judgment
of the High Court impugned before us. All that the High Court has done is to reaffirm
and require the State Government and its instrumentalities, as "State" under the
Constitution, to act without arbitrariness and mala fides, especially in the matter of
land acquisition. It is pertinent to note that the State had agreed (vide clause 5.1.1.1 of
the FWA) in respect of the lands required under the FWA, that:
"GOK shall use its best efforts and cause its governmental instrumentalities to use
their best efforts, to exercise its and their legal right of eminent domain (or other
right of similar nature) under the laws of India to acquire the acquired land. Prior to
acquiring any acquired land, GOK will obtain from the Company written
confirmation of its willingness to purchase such acquired land from GOK at the
purchase price (whether in the form of cash or comparable land) required under the
laws of India (the 'acquired land compensation'). GOK shall offer to the expropriated
owners of the land the rehabilitation package specifically worked out for this
Infrastructure Corridor Project with mutual consultation of the consortium and the
Revenue Authorities in accordance with the applicable rules."
62. In these circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the said directions of the High Court.
In the future also, we make it clear that while the State Government and its instrumentalities are
entitled to exercise their contractual rights under the FWA, they must do so fairly, reasonably and
without mala fides; in the event that they do not do so, the Court will be entitled to interfere with the
same.
16.2 As can be seen from the aforesaid judgment, the Apex Court has categorically held that in
future also, the State Government and its instrumentalities (KIADB) are duty bound to exercise
their contractual rights under the FWA fairly, reasonably and without mala fides and in the event
they do not do so, the Court would be entitled to interfere with the same. In the light of the specific
finding and direction recorded by the Apex Court in relation to the FWA, I am of the view that the
said defence urged by the respondents regarding maintainability of the petitions cannot be accepted.
16.3 It is also relevant to state that there is no nexus or connection between the validity, legality or
correctness of the impugned awards to the FWA or the Agreement entered into between the
petitioners and respondents; the dispute with regard to the impugned awards that arises in the
present petitions does not relate to contractual matters / disputes but rather to the validity and
legality of the impugned awards; merely because the petitioners have entered into Agreements with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 37
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
the respondents, it cannot be said that the issue in controversy involves dispute of contractual
nature that cannot be decided in the present petitions and as such, the said contention urged by the
respondents with regard to maintainability of the petitions is liable to be rejected.
16.4 The material on record also discloses that the duty cast upon the respondents to act fairly, justly
and reasonably in relation to the Agreements entered into between them and the petitioners has
been recognised, confirmed and upheld by the Apex Court as well as this Court in the earlier round
of litigation including the case of State of Karnataka vs. All India Manufacturers Organisation -
(2006) 4 SCC 683, wherein the jurisdiction of this Court to interfere under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India has been upheld; the said decision inter-parties between the petitioners and
respondents has attained finality and become conclusive and binding upon the respondents and
consequently, it cannot be said that the petitions are not maintainable.
16.5 It is also significant to note that mere existence of a contract or an arbitration clause in the
same does not oust the jurisdiction of this Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India as held in several decisions of the Apex Court as well as this Court including
the decision in the case of Unitech Limited vs. TSIIC - 2021 SCC Online SC 99; accordingly, the
petitions are maintainable on this ground also.
16.6 A perusal of the material on record will indicate that the issues in controversy that arise for
consideration in the present petitions is with regard to the legality, validity and correctness of the
impugned awards; enforcement of the rights and liabilities of the parties to the FWA or the
Agreement between the petitioners and KIADB is not the subject matter involved in the present
petitions; in other words, the legality or validity of the impugned awards does not arise out of any
contractual dispute / matter arising out of aforesaid Agreements or its covenants and in the absence
of disputed / complicated questions of fact arising in relation to the said Agreements coupled with
the fact that the present dispute is only with regard to the impugned awards, it cannot be said that
merely because the petitioners had entered into the FWA and Agreement with the respondents, the
present dispute relates to contractual matters and are not capable of being adjudicated by this Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
16.7 In the case of Unitech Limited case (supra), after referring to its earlier judgments, the Apex
Court has reiterated that even if there was arbitration clause in a contract, a writ petition was
maintainable and the same does not preclude this Court from exercising its jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is also relevant to state that the scope of the present
petitions is with regard to the action of the State and the KIADB in passing the impugned awards
and not with regard to interpretation or enforcement of contractual rights and liabilities under the
Agreements and since no complicated / disputed questions of fact require adjudication for the
purpose of determining the legality or validity of the impugned awards, I am of the view that the
present petitions are maintainable.
Accordingly, Point No.2 is also answered in favour of the petitioners by holding that the petition is
maintainable and by rejecting the various contentions urged by the respondents in this regard.

Re-Point No.3:-
17. Having come to the conclusion that the present petitions filed by NICE are maintainable and that
NICE has locus standi to maintain the petitions, the next question that arises for consideration is
whether the impugned awards are sustainable in law.
17.1 As stated supra, since the respondents did not pass awards even after a long lapse of time,
petitioners approached this Court in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012 wherein directions were issued to
the respondents to pass awards; the said judgment of this Court attained finality despite attempts
made by the respondents to challenge the same. Meanwhile, litigations in relation to the acquisition
were also pending before this Court as well as before the Apex Court. It was only after the said
directions issued to the State and the KIADB to pass awards were reiterated by this Court vide order
on I.A.2/2016 in W.P.Nos.35638- 639/2012 dated 27.10.2017 that the SLAOs started passing
awards between March, 2018 to June, 2018. It is an undisputed fact that the KIADB sent the said
awards for approval to the State Government on 03.11.2018; however, the same were withdrawn on
13.11.2018 in view of the note of the Chief Secretary that if the awards are passed, the stand of the
State Government with regard to excess land would be weakened and the opinion of the learned
Advocate General has to be obtained before proceeding further.
17.2 In this context, it is relevant to state that a perusal of the letter at Annexure-Z dated 13.11.2018
written by the KIADB to the Principal Secretary, Department of Industries and Commerce,
Bengaluru, will clearly indicate that both the original order dated 29.11.2013 passed by this Court in
W.P.Nos.35638- 639/2012 as well as the aforesaid order dated 27.10.2017 have been referred to by
the KIADB by stating that awards have been directed to be passed by this Court. The said letter also
indicates that on 03.11.2018, the awards prepared by the SLAOs have been forwarded to the State
Government; the said letter also refers to the note of the Chief Secretary which shows the details of
the excess land of about 554 acres which were said to have been handed over to the petitioners and
that several Affidavits have been filed before the Apex Court in contempt petition 96/2007 stating
handing over of excess land of 554 acres to NICE as well as the fact that KIADB has handed over
paper possession of 344 acres of land without passing award and without giving compensation to
the land owners. The said note also states that the petitioners are asking for passing of awards for
344 acres of land based on this Court's judgment in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012, wherein it is directed
that awards should be passed by holding that there is no proof of handing over excess land to the
petitioners. In the said note, it is further stated that if the State Government and KIADB passes
awards for 344 acres, the stand of the State Government before the Apex Court in the contempt
proceedings will become weak and that the petitioners herein would argue that there is no excess
land and will demand penalty of over Rs.25 crores from the State Government and KIADB. Under
these circumstances, the Chief Secretary stated in the note that it was better to refer the file to the
learned Advocate General for opinion regarding passing of award of 344 acres.
17.3 After referring to the aforesaid note, the KIADB requested the State Government to return the
proposed award and that the same would be sent after the opinion of the learned Advocate General
was taken in view of the aforesaid note of the Chief Secretary.

Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
17.4 On 16.04.2019, learned Advocate General rendered an opinion that the KIADB and the State do
not have any choice but to pass an award in view of the earlier orders passed by this Court in
W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012; however, in the said opinion, it was stated that the market value of the
property as on 16.04.2019 had to be taken having regard to the enormous delay in passing the
award.
17.5 As can be seen from the aforesaid opinion rendered by the learned Advocate General, it is
opined by him that the State and KIADB have no option / choice but to proceed to pass awards;
however, the said opinion further states that the awards should take into account the market value
as on date having regard to the enormous delay in passing the award; a perusal of the impugned
awards will indicate that though Section 11 of the L.A.Act mandates that the market value should be
reckoned as on the date of the preliminary notifications, the SLAOs have shifted the date to a date
subsequent / later to the preliminary notifications based on the opinion of the learned Advocate
General.
17.6 As rightly contended by the learned Senior counsel for the petitioners, the material on record,
in particular the letter dated 03.11.2018 under which the KIADB sent the proposed awards for
approval to the State Government will indicate that the SLAOs had taken the market value of the
lands as on the date of the preliminary notifications; however, before the State Government could
approve the said awards, the Chief Secretary put up a note with regard to passing of the awards on
the ground that the defence of the State would be weakened before the Apex Court, if awards are
passed and therefore, it is necessary that the opinion of the learned Advocate General had to be
obtained; neither the letter dated 13.11.2018 written by the KIADB purporting to withdraw the
proposed awards nor the note of the Chief Secretary or the query put forth to the learned Advocate
General for opinion stated / indicated anything with regard to shifting of the date from the date of
the preliminary notification; on the other hand, the letter, note and the query to the learned
Advocate General was restricted and limited to only examining and giving an opinion with regard to
feasibility of passing awards in the light of the contempt proceedings before the Apex court with
regard to the excess land; needless to state that the said contempt proceedings did not relate to
passing of the awards in respect of the lands already acquired. Under these circumstances, it is clear
that the scope and ambit of the query posed to the learned Advocate General and the opinion sought
for by him in the light of the undisputed directions issued by this Court in W.P.Nos.35638-639/2012
was only with regard to feasibility of passing the awards in view of the Apex Court proceedings and
not with regard to shifting of the date; in other words, there was no occasion to consider the
question with regard to shifting of the date from the date of the preliminary notification and the said
shifting was not the subject matter of the earlier Court proceedings before this Court, proceedings
before the Apex Court or the other material on record including the aforesaid communications, note,
query etc., and consequently, the said opinion of the learned Advocate General which was clearly
beyond the scope and ambit of the subject matter of opinion could not have been made the basis by
the SLAOs to pass the impugned awards by shifting the date from the date of the preliminary
notifications and the impugned awards are illegal, arbitrary and vitiated and liable to be quashed on
this ground also.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 40
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
17.7 As stated supra, pursuant to the aforesaid opinion of the learned Advocate General, the
Principal Secretary writes a letter vide Annexure-P dated 16.04.2019 to the CEO, KIADB to take
necessary steps and pass awards in terms of the said opinion of the learned Advocate General.
Pursuant thereto, the CEO addresses a communication dated 20.04.2019 vide Annexure-Q to the
Special Deputy Commissioner (BMICP) and SLAO (BMICP) calling upon them to immediately
prepare and pass awards and send them for approval in terms of the opinion of the learned
Advocate General. Upon receipt of the said letter, the SLAOs write letters at Annexures-R and S,
both dated 22.04.2019 raising certain queries including, whether it was permissible to revise the
awards already passed, since Section 13-A of the L.A.Act permitted only correction of clerical or
arithmetical mistakes. In response thereto, the CEO, KIADB addressed a communication vide
Annexure-T dated 22.04.2019 to the SLAOs and the Special Deputy Commissioner inter alia
intimating them that under Rule 14 of the KIAD Rules, the SLAOs were empowered and authorised
to pass awards and that accordingly, since the SLAOs were performing quasi judicial duties, it was
not permissible to issue directions to them in this regard. It was also stated in the said letter that the
awards prepared by the SLAOs earlier had not been approved and that since the contempt
proceedings were coming up before the Apex Court on 24.04.2019, the SLAOs were directed to pass
awards on the basis of the opinion of the Advocate General as well as the judgments of the Apex
Court.
17.8 A perusal of the impugned awards will indicate that the opinion of the learned Advocate
General as well as the judgments of the Apex Court referred to in the awards were the only two
factors that were taken into account for the purpose of passing the awards by the SLAOs. As stated
supra, in so far as the opinion of the learned Advocate General is concerned, the same with regard to
shifting of the date to reckon the market value of the land from the date of the preliminary
notification to a later date is concerned, the said opinion was beyond the scope and ambit of the
query put forth to him and consequently, the said opinion could not have been made the basis by the
SLAOs to pass the impugned awards.
17.9 Though it is sought to be contended by the respondents that the opinion of the learned
Advocate General was not taken into account to pass the impugned awards, the said contention is
clearly and factually incorrect in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, in particular, the
correspondence referred to supra between the SLAOs, KIADB and the State Government, wherein
the SLAOs have been directed to pass awards in consonance with and in terms of the said opinion.
Under these circumstances, the said contention of the respondents that the opinion of the learned
Advocate General did not have any bearing or impact on the impugned awards cannot be accepted.
17.10 The second factor/circumstance that has been taken into account by the SLAOs to shift the
date to reckon the market value of the lands from the date of the preliminary notification to a
later/subsequent dates is by placing reliance upon the following decisions of the Apex Court viz.,
a) Competent Authority Vs. Barangor Jute Factory C/w State of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Onkar Prasad
Patel - (2005) 13 SCC 47;
b) Gaurishankar Gaur Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh - (1994) 1 SCC 92; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 41
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
c) Haji Saeed Khan Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh - (2001) 9 SCC 513.
17.11 In this context, it is relevant to state that as can be seen from the aforesaid decisions as well as
various decisions of the Apex Court as well as this Court referred to supra by both sides, that the
market value of the acquired lands has to be taken as on the date of the preliminary notification as
contemplated under Section 11 of the L.A. Act, 1894; it has been held that under exceptional
circumstances, where either the Apex Court or High Courts came to the conclusion that the
acquisition proceedings themselves were liable to be quashed on account of certain illegalities or
infirmities in the acquisition process/procedure, it was permissible only for the Apex Court in
exercise of its powers under Articles 32 / 142 or the High Courts under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India to shift the date to a later/subsequent date; however, this power to shift the
date is available only to either the Apex Court or the High Courts and not definitely / certainly to the
SLAOs or the State Government; in other words, a perusal of the decisions referred to supra, will
indicate that in cases, where the Apex Court as well as this Court deemed it necessary to shift the
date in order to do complete and substantial justice, inherent powers of the Courts were invoked and
the dates were shifted in order to ensure no hardship, loss or prejudice would be caused to the land
losers.
17.12 A perusal of the decisions relied upon by the SLAOs in the impugned awards referred to supra,
will clearly indicate that in the said cases, the Apex Court has invoked its extra ordinary jurisdiction
and powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and in the peculiar/special facts and
circumstances obtaining in the said cases, the Apex Court had shifted the date to reckon the market
value. The SLAOs clearly fell in error in placing reliance upon the said decisions of the Apex Court
for the purpose of shifting the date from the date of the preliminary notification without
appreciating that the said shifting of the date by the SLAOs or the State Government is not legally
permissible in law either under the provisions of the L.A. Act, 1894 or the KIAD Act or the Rules or
by any judicial precedent. It is also relevant to state that even as per the aforesaid judgments,
shifting of the date from the date of the preliminary notification to any later / subsequent date has
been done only up to the date of taking possession from the land losers. In the instant case, the
impugned awards disclose that the SLAOs have shifted the date to a date subsequent / later to the
date of taking possession. Under these circumstances, it is clear that the impugned awards
purporting to shift the date suffers from several legal and factual infirmities and illegalities which
vitiate the impugned awards, which deserve to be quashed on this ground also.
17.13 As stated supra, on 03.11.2018, the KIADB sent the awards for approval by taking the market
value as on the date of the preliminary notification. Prior or subsequent to the said date, the land
losers did not put forth any claim requesting shifting of the date; so also, even during award
proceedings prior to 03.11.2018, no claim regarding shifting of the date was put forth by the land
losers; further, there was no query put to the learned Advocate General nor was he asked for his
opinion with regard to shifting of the date; similarly, the correspondence between the State
Government, KIADB, SLAOs and the learned Advocate General indicate that there was no
discussion regarding shifting of the date or with regard to revising the awards sent by the KIADB on
03.11.2018 and the only aspect discussed was with regard to passing of the awards already sent
affecting the defence of the State before the Apex Court. Viewed from this angle also, the SLAOs
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 42
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
clearly fell in error in shifting the date in the impugned awards which is not only contrary to law but
also the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case and consequently, the impugned awards
deserve to be quashed on this ground also.
17.14 The material on record indicates that the petitioners have complied with the terms and
conditions of the agreements entered into between them and the respondents 1 to 5 and the delay on
the part of the respondents in passing the awards is not attributable to the petitioners; the previous
round of litigation in relation to the subject matter of the petitions including the orders passed by
this Court and the Apex Court will clearly indicate that there has been huge and enormous delay on
the part of respondents 1 to 5 in passing the awards and consequently, the impugned awards
fastening the liability to pay higher compensation upon the petitioners deserve to be set aside.
17.15 Though the last final notification was issued on 02.06.2009 by the respondents, the impugned
awards were passed only in the year 2019 that too after repeated requests made by the petitioners
and several directions issued by this Court and the Apex Court and as such, the impugned awards
resulting in the liability to pay enhanced compensation upon the petitioners are incorrect and
deserve to be quashed.
17.16 A perusal of the impugned awards will indicate that the impugned awards have been passed
hastily and without any application of mind; no valid or cogent reasons have been assigned in the
impugned awards, so as to permit shifting of the date for calculating the value of the land from the
date of the preliminary notifications as contemplated under Section 11(1) of the L.A.Act to a later
date, particularly when the delay and long gap between the date of the preliminary notifications and
the impugned awards was not attributable to the petitioners.
17.17 Since the petitioners are beneficiaries of the acquisition, they were entitled to be heard during
the course of an enquiry before passing the impugned awards under Section 11 of the L.A.Act and
consequently, the impugned awards which have been passed without providing any opportunity to
the petitioners, are violative of principles of natural justice and the same deserve to be quashed on
this ground also.
17.18 It is contended on behalf of the State Government that Article 165(2) of the Constitution of
India mandates that it shall be the duty of the learned Advocate General to give advise to the
Government of the State upon such legal matters and to perform such other duties of a legal
character, as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the Governor and to discharge
the functions conferred upon him by or under the constitution or any other law for the time being in
force. It is contended that in view of the aforesaid constitutional mandate, the SLAOs were justified
in placing reliance upon the opinion of the learned Advocate General in order to pass the impugned
awards. In my considered opinion, this contention is wholly misconceived, inasmuch as the said
opinion of the learned Advocate General would have to be considered in the backdrop of the various
facts and circumstances referred to supra, which clearly establishes that the scope and ambit of the
opinion was restricted to the feasibility of passing the awards and not with regard to shifting of the
date. Under these circumstances, even this contention of the respondents cannot be accepted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82071706/ 43
Nandi Infrastructure Corridor ... vs Government Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
17.19 It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that the SLAOs having passed the awards in the
year 2018 and sent it for approval on 03.11.2018, it was not open for the State Government or the
SLAOs to pass the impugned revised awards by enhancing / increasing the compensation payable to
the land losers. In this context, it is contended that Section 13-A of the L.A.Act permits only
correction of clerical or arithmetical mistakes or errors in the award and not pass revised awards. It
is also contended that the power of the State Government under Section 15-A of the L.A.Act to
exercise revisional jurisdiction in relation to acquisition proceedings is permitted only till awards
are made by the SLAOs and since the awards had already been made and forwarded for approval on
03.11.2018, it was not permissible for the SLAOs or the State Government to pass the impugned
revised awards. Alternatively, it is submitted that even assuming that Section 15-A of the L.A.Act
permitted the State Government to exercise revisional powers, the same had to be exercised in terms
of the proviso to Section 15-A of the L.A.Act, which mandates that the State Government shall not
pass or issue any order or direction prejudicial to any person without affording such person a
reasonable opportunity of being heard; it is therefore contended that in the light of the proposed
awards forwarded by the SLAOs on 03.11.2018, by taking the date of the preliminary notification,
before the State Government directed the said awards to be changed / modified by exercising
revisional powers, it was incumbent upon the State to provide sufficient and reasonable opportunity
to the petitioners, particularly when the change / modified awards directed enhanced / increased
compensation payable by the petitioners.
17.20 It is contended by the respondents that the proposed awards forwarded by the SLAOs on
03.11.2018 were not awards in the eye of law, since prior approval had not been obtained before
passing the same and consequently, it was open for the State Government to issue necessary
directions to the SLAOs to pass awards. In this context, reliance is placed on Section 15-A of the
L.A.Act (as inserted by Karnataka Act No. 17 of 1961) in order to contend that it was open for the
State Government to exercise regional powers before an award was made i.e., before approval was
granted by the State Government. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in the case of
N.Boman Behram vs. State of Mysore - AIR 1974 SC 1717. It was therefore contended that the
impugned awards do not suffer from any illegality or infirmity.
17.21 Section 15-A was inserted by the State Government vide Karnataka Act No. 17 of 1961 w.e.f.
24.08.1961; the said provision conferring revisional powers upon the State Government did not
contain any proviso to the said provision; the judgment of the Apex Court in Boman's case (supra)
was rendered prior to Section 15-A of the L.A.Act being inserted by the Central Government vide
Central Act No.68 of 1984 w.e.f. 24.09.1984; there is no gainsaying the fact that Section 15-A of the
L.A.Act as inserted by the Central Act No.68 of 1984 has the effect of repealing Section 15-A of the
L.A.Act inserted by the State Act referred to supra; it follows therefrom that as on the date of the
impugned awards, Section 15-A of the State Act had stood repealed and Section 15-A of the Central
Act was in force; accordingly, the revisional powers by the State Government subsequent to the
SLAOs' forwarding the proposed awards on 03.11.2018 had to be exercised strictly in accordance
with Section 15-A of the Central Act, in particular, the proviso which mandates that there should be
strict adherence to the principles of natural justice which are inbuilt into the proviso by providing /
affording reasonable and sufficient opportunity to the petitioners; to put it differently, in the light of
the proviso to Section 15-A of the L.A.Act, it was absolutely essential that the State Government

provides sufficient and reasonable opportunity to the petitioners before exercising revisional
jurisdiction and issuing directions and passing orders to the SLAOs to pass awards after obtaining
the opinion of the learned Advocate General. Under these circumstances, in the light of the
undisputed fact that pursuant to the SLAOs submitting / forwarding the awards for approval on
03.11.2018, the impugned revised awards based on orders and directions issued by the State
Government, thereby enhancing the compensation which would have to be payable by the
petitioners is not only contrary to Section 15-A of the L.A.Act but also to the principles of natural
justice and consequently, the impugned awards deserve to be quashed on this ground also.
17.22 Though both sides have referred to several other decisions in addition to the decisions
discussed supra, in the light of the factual matrix of the instant case and the said decisions having
been rendered in the peculiar / special facts and circumstances of the said cases, I am of the view
that the same may not be necessary to be adverted to for the purpose of adjudication of the present
case.
Accordingly, Point No.3 is answered in favour of the petitioners by holding that the impugned
awards are illegal, arbitrary and vitiated and that the same deserve to be quashed and necessary
directions are to be issued to the respondents to pass fresh awards within a stipulated timeframe.
18. In the result, I pass the following:-
