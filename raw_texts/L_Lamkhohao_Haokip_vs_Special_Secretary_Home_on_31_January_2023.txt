ORDER (ORAL)
Sanjay Kumar (C.J.):
[1] By way of this writ petition, the petitioner assails the order dated 11.10.2022 of the
Special Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, whereby he was subjected to
preventive detention in exercise of power under Section 3(1) of the Prevention of
Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988. He seeks a
consequential writ of habeas corpus to set him at liberty forthwith.
[2] Heard Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. Th. Vashum, learned
Government Advocate, for respondent Nos. 1 & 2; and Mr. S. Kaminikumar, learned CGSC,
appearing for respondent No. 3. [3] Mr. Th. Jugindro, learned counsel, would urge two primary
grounds of attack against the impugned detention order. Firstly, he would contend that there is
delay in the disposal of the petitioner's representation against his detention and secondly, he would
assert that there is clear and patent violation of the mandatory procedure prescribed under the
Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 (for brevity,
'the Act of 1988'). [4] The order of detention is dated 11.10.2022. Pursuant thereto, the petitioner
was admittedly arrested on 17.10.2022. He submitted a representation against his detention on
04.11.2022 and the same came to be rejected only on 25.11.2022. The Affidavit-in-opposition filed
by the Deputy Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur, indicates that the said representation
was forwarded by the Superintendent of Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, under letter dated
07.11.2022. It was received by the Home Department on 08.11.2022. The Deputy Secretary,
however, admitted that the execution of the detention order on 17.10.2022 and the grounds of
detention dated 20.10.2022 were communicated to the Government of India only under letter dated
24.10.2022 through e-mail. As regards disposal of the representation at the State level, the Deputy
Secretary stated that the W.P. (Crl) No. 54 of 2022 Page 2 representation was forwarded to the
police authorities for their para-wise comments under letter dated 10.11.2022 and para-wise
comments were forwarded by the Superintendent of Police, Churachandpur, under letter dated
13.11.2022, which was received on 16.11.2022. After considering the same, the representation was
rejected vide order dated 25.11.2022. The time taken for processing and disposing of the
representation was explained by stating that there were intermittent holidays falling in between and
as the officials dealing with the matter were engaged with important assignments, including
protocol and liaison duties in attending to VVIPs/VIPs/Foreign Dignitaries who were visiting
Manipur to partake in the Manipur Sangai Festival, 2022, [5] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned Government
Advocate, would place reliance on the observation of the Supreme Court in Senthamilselvi Vs. State
of Tamil Nadu and another {(2006) 5 SCC 676} that once the representation against the detention is
disposed of with utmost expedition, no fault can be attributed to the authorities. The Supreme Court
observed therein that there can be no hard- and-fast rule as to the measure of reasonable time and

each case would have to be considered individually. Per the Supreme Court, if there is no negligence
or callous inaction or avoidable red tapism on the facts of a particular case, the Court would not
interfere and it is only when there is remissness, indifference or avoidable delay on the part of the
authorities that the detention would become vulnerable. In the case on hand, disposal of the
petitioner's representation was within 3(three) weeks from the date of its making. The said
representation was received by the Home Department on 08.11.2022 and the delay in dispatch of
the same by the Jail authorities was due to the intervening weekend holidays on 05.11.2022 and
06.11.2022. After the comments of the police authorities were received on 16.11.2022, there is no
delay as such in dealing with the said representation, as 19.11.2022 and 20.11.2022 were holidays
again, being Saturday and Sunday, and W.P. (Crl) No. 54 of 2022 Page 3 the Sangai Festival
commenced from 21.11.2022. As the said festival was of great importance to the State, in terms of
boosting tourism and highlighting the State's culture and heritage, the time taken to dispose of the
representation, being a mere 5(five) days, cannot be said to be unreasonable. More so, as the
disposal of the representation took place even before the conclusion of the festival. [6] That being
said, the failure on the part of the State authorities in complying with the statutory mandate is
altogether a different matter. Mr. S. Kaminikumar, learned CGSC, filed the affidavit-in-opposition of
the Deputy Secretary (PIT-ND&PS), Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of
India. Therein, the Deputy Secretary stated that the report in respect of the detention order dated
11.10.2022 was received by the Government of India from the Special Secretary (Home),
Government of Manipur, only on 24.10.2022, when the office letter bearing that date was
communicated through email. [7] Reference may now be made to Section 3(2) of the Act of 1988 in
the context of the procedure to be followed in that regard. This provision unequivocally states that
when any order of detention is made by the State Government or by an officer empowered by the
State Government, the State Government shall, within ten days, forward to the Central Government
a report in respect of the order. In comparison, Section 3(3) of the Act of 1988 provides that the
grounds on which the order of detention has been made shall be communicated to the person
detained pursuant thereto, ordinarily not later than five days after the detention. Therefore, this
provision links the time stipulated for communication to the 'actual' detention and not to the 'date'
of the order of detention. However, Section 3(2) of the Act of 1988 categorically states that the
communication to the Central Government should be made by the State Government within ten
days from the day the order of detention is 'made' either by the State Government or by an officer
empowered by it.
W.P. (Crl) No. 54 of 2022 Page 4
[8] In the case on hand, the order of detention was made on 11.10.2022
and it was communicated to the Central Government only on 24.10.2022, and at that, by e-mail.
There is no explanation forthcoming as to why such communication by e-mail could not have been
addressed by the State authorities within the statutorily prescribed time. This lapse on their part
would be fatal to the very validity and continuance of the impugned detention order dated
11.10.2022. [9] Orders of preventive detention issued under special enactments have the effect of
denying and depriving citizens of their personal liberties without following the ordinary processes of
law. Therefore, the procedures prescribed in such special enactments have to be scrupulously
adhered to. Any lapse in doing so would render the entire exercise null and void in the eye of law.

L. Lamkhohao Haokip vs Special Secretary (Home) on 31 January, 2023
[10] That being so, this Court has no hesitation in invalidating the impugned detention order dated
11.10.2022 on the ground of violation of the statutory procedure prescribed under Section 3(2) of
the Act of 1988. [11] The order of detention dated 11.10.2022 issued by the Special Secretary
(Home), Government of Manipur, is accordingly set aside. All consequential proceedings based
thereon shall also stand set aside. The petitioner, L. Lamkhohao Haokip, presently incarcerated in
Manipur Central Jail, Sajiwa, shall be set at liberty forthwith unless his continued incarceration is
validly required in connection with any other case.
WP (Cril.) No. 54 of 2022 is accordingly allowed.
In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.
