4. Pursuant to the order dated 02.03.2023, the Registrar Judicial of this court has recorded the

Stated, that I have amicably resolved all issues and disputes with Anita Devi

Brahmana for commission of offences under section 498-A/342/323 RPC and
consequent proceedings /challan No. 87/2019 under section 498-A/342/323/147

Karan Singh & Ors vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
section 498- A/342/323/147 RPC pending before the Court of learned Additional
Munsiff, Samba.
5. Bare perusal of the statements of petitioner No.1 and respondent No.2 placed on record
demonstrate that the parties have entered into a compromise whereby they have settled their
disputes/issues, so there would be no chance of conviction in near future in case trial is held and
concluded.
6. The Apex Court in the case of "B. S. Joshi & others Vs State of Haryana and another", reported in
(2003) 4 SCC 675, while discussing the ambit and scope of inherent powers of High Courts under
Section 482 CPC in paras 1, 3, 11, 14, 15 and 16 held as under :
"1.The question that falls for determination in the instant case is about the ambit of
the inherent powers of the High Courts under Section 482, Code of Criminal
Procedure (Code) read with Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India to
quash criminal proceedings. The scope and ambit of power under Section 482 has
been examined by this Court in catena of earlier decisions but in the present case that
is required to be considered in relation to matrimonial disputes. The matrimonial
disputes of the kind in the present case have been on considerable increase in recent
times resulting in filing of complaints by the wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC
not only against the husband but his other family members also. When such matters
are resolved either by wife agreeing to rejoin the matrimonial home or mutual
separation of husband and wife and also mutual settlement of other pending disputes
as a result whereof both sides approach the High Court and jointly pray for quashing
of the criminal proceedings or the First Information Report or complaint filed by the
wife under Sections 498A and 406, IPC, can the prayer be declined on the ground
that since the offences are non-compoundable under Section 320 of the Code and,
therefore, it is not permissible for the Court to quash the criminal proceedings or FIR
or complaint.
3.The High Court has, by the impugned judgment, dismissed the petition filed by the
appellants seeking quashing of the FIR for in view of the High Court the offences
under Sections 498A and 406 IPC are non-compoundable and the inherent powers
under Section 482 of the Code cannot be invoked to bypass the mandatory provision
of Section 320 of the Code. For its view, the High Court has referred to and relied
upon the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan Lal & Ors. [1992
Supp.(1) SCC 335]; Madhu Limaye v. The State of Maharashtra [(1977) 4 SCC 551;
and Surendra Nath Mohanty & Anr. v. State of Orissa [AIR 1999 SC 2181].
11.In Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia & Ors. v. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre & Ors.
[(1988) 1 SCC 692], it was held that while exercising inherent power of quashing
under Section 482, it is for the High Court to take into consideration any special
features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in
the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. Where, in the opinion of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126179029/ 3
Karan Singh & Ors vs Ut Of J&K & Anr on 27 March, 2023
the Court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful
purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the
court may, while taking into consideration the special facts of a case, also quash the
proceedings.
14.There is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section
498A in the Indian Penal Code was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband
or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a
husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives
to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be
counterproductive and would act against interests of women and against the object
for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of
inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent
women from settling earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of Indian Penal
Code.
15.In view of the above discussion, we hold that the High Court in exercise of its
inherent powers can quash criminal proceedings or FIR or complaint and Section
320 of the Code does not limit or affect the powers under Section 482 of the Code.
16.For the foregoing reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment and allow the
appeal and quash the FIR above mentioned."
7. Ratio of the judgment of B. S. Joshi's case (supra) makes the legal proposition abundantly clear,
that the High Court has inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to
quash the proceedings even for non-compoundable offences to meet the ends of justice if the parties
have settled their disputes amicably by a compromise.
Ratio of the judgment (supra) squarely applies to the facts of the case in hand. In view of the above,
instant petition is allowed. Consequently, FIR No. 73/2019 dated 22.06.2019 registered at Police
Station Bari Brahmana (Samba) for the commission of offences punishable under sections 498-
A/342/323 RPC against the petitioners alongwith all the proceedings arising out of the same FIR
pending in the Court of learned Additional Munsiff (JMIC) Samba, in view of the compromise
arrived at between the parties, stands quashed. Copy of this order be forthwith provided to the Court
below/concerned police station for information and compliance.
8. Disposed of accordingly.
