For Respondent : Mr.J.Parekh Kumar
JUDGMENT
************** [Judgment of the Court was delivered by THE HONOURABLE CHIEF JUSTICE] We
have considered the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the appellants / State and we
have also perused the Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.528, Personal and Administrative Reforms
(PER.F.) Department, dated 10.10.1988, the production whereof was required by us vide earlier
order dated 17.12.2019 in this appeal.
2.The contention of the learned counsel for the State is that in the absence of any regular vacancy,
the question of applying the G.O.Ms.No.528 does not arise in the present controversy and therefore,
the Judgment of the learned Single Judge extending the benefit of regular appointment to a part
time employee is unjustified, for which, reliance is placed by the learned counsel on the Judgment of
the Apex Court in the case of SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT, SCHOOL EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT, CHENNAI v. R.GOVINDASWAMY AND OTHERS, decided on 21st February, 2014.

3.We have perused the said Judgment and verified that the same proceeded only to consider the
impact of Judgments arising out of the other High Courts without discussing the impact of the
relevant Government Orders or the provisions applicable to the controversy as presently involved.
In our opinion, the Judgement, therefore, would not squarely apply to this case. The Judgment in
the case of STATE OF TAMIL NADU v. A.SINGAMUTHU, reported in 2017 (4) SCC 113, also would
not be applicable keeping in view the fact that G.O.Ms.No.22 was of the year 2006 dealing with
regularisation from the date of appointment or from the date regularisation.
4. In the present case, the post occupied by the respondent / petitioner is that of a Sweeper /
Scavenger in a Government Higher Secondary School on part time basis, where the respondent has
been continuing for the past 22 years. This Court, even otherwise, cannot imagine a school having
thousands of children to be looked after for health and hygiene with the aid of a part time employee,
that too, even a single Sweeper. We, therefore, find that the State Government rightly came up with
a scheme for regular appointments and even assuming for the sake of argument that
G.O.Ms.No.528, would not consequently apply keeping in view the nature of the vacancy or
otherwise even, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned Judgment on the ground that the
post of a Sweeper or Scavenger in a Government school is a sine qua non http://www.judis.nic.in
and such post deserves to be made available to an institution keeping in view the nature of the
requirement. We, therefore, are not inclined to interfere with the discretion exercised by the learned
Single Judge under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, without prejudice to the rights of the
State to contest any other case, on the issue of Law, that may be involved therein.
