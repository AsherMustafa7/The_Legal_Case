The District Manager, Bihar State Food ... vs Lala Shatrudhan Kumar Sinha And Ors on 24 October, 2019
For the reasons stated in the application, the delay in preferring the appeal is condoned.
The application stands allowed.
The appellant/corporation has questioned the judgment dated 14.03.2018 passed by the learned
Single Judge of this Court on 14.03.2018 in C.W.J.C. No. 23434 of 2013 whereby the punishment
imposed on the respondent by order dated 19.06.2009 by the Managing Director, Bihar State Food
& Civil Supplies Corporation as well as the order dated 06.11.2012 passed by the appellate authority,
affirming the order of punishment has been set aside on the ground of charges being vague and the
respondent not having been served with any opportunity of knowing the reason for and responding
to the disciplinary authority differing with the opinion of the enquiry officer.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1333 of 2018 dt.24-10-2019 The respondent was subjected to a
departmental proceeding on the basis of an enquiry conducted by the Vigilance Investigation
Bureau in connection with irregularities which were found in the upliftment and the distribution of
foodgrains under the two schemes of the Government viz. Annapurna and Antyodya Schemes in the
Dighwara Nagar Panchayat in the district of Chapra.
On a preliminary enquiry when it was found that there were some irregularities, a show cause notice
was issued to the respondent, as he during the aforesaid check period, served as Incharge Manager
of the Corporation at Saran.
From the charge-memo which was served upon the respondent, it appears that sample of foodgrains
was taken by the Vigilance Investigation Bureau for coming to the conclusion that persons who had
to be given the benefit of such claims were left high and dry whereas undeserving persons took
advantage of the aforesaid Patna High Court L.P.A No.1333 of 2018 dt.24-10-2019 scheme of the
Government which was meant for the benefit of the last man in the row.
This memo of charge was found to be absolutely vague by the learned Single Judge in as much as
details were not provided in the aforesaid charge-memo regarding the method of assessment of the
irregularities in the upliftment and distribution of foodgrains. The basis for coming to such
conclusion about the irregularities was made after the assessment of the sample of the foodgrains.
Though this aspect of the matter has not been taken note of by the learned Single Judge but if the
sample was the basis for forming an opinion in the preliminary enquiry by the Vigilance
Investigation Bureau, it could have been only with respect to the quality of foodgrains and not with
respect to the upliftment and distribution of such foodgrains at concessional price to the needy in
accordance with the aforenoted beneficial schemes of the Government.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.1333 of 2018 dt.24-10-2019 The enquiry report which was brought on
record by the respondent as Annexure-8 further reflects that the opinion was arrived at on the basis
of the statistics collected from the centre which was under the charge of the respondent.
However, while forming an opinion and submitting a report against the respondent, the enquiry
officer clearly stated in his report that the doubts with respect to non- implementation of the scheme

The District Manager, Bihar State Food ... vs Lala Shatrudhan Kumar Sinha And Ors on 24 October, 2019
in letter and spirit was never refuted by the respondent totally and therefore the charges raised
against him were found to be partially proved.
The respondent appears to have raised the issue that if this was the tenor of the enquiry report, and
the disciplinary authority proceeded to differ with such report, it was of utmost necessity that the
grounds for differing with such enquiry report ought to have been communicated to the respondent
for him to reply to the same. That not having been done, the learned Single Patna High Court L.P.A
No.1333 of 2018 dt.24-10-2019 Judge came to the conclusion that the proceedings stood vitiated
and therefore the orders passed by the disciplinary and the appellate authority became suspect as
having been passed without observance of the requirements in a domestic enquiry.
The order passed by the disciplinary authority also appears to be cryptic and does not refer to the
grounds taken by the respondent before it. Similar flaw could easily be seen in the appellate order.
It is for these reasons, which have been recorded in paragraph-7 of the impugned judgment, the
order passed by the disciplinary authority, reducing the salary of the respondent to its minimum
level and stopping of three increments with cumulative effect was set aside. The appellate order was
also quashed for the same reasons.
The learned Single Judge, on finding that the respondent had superannuated, did not consider it
appropriate to direct for a fresh enquiry and therefore Patna High Court L.P.A No.1333 of 2018
dt.24-10-2019 closed the proceedings so far as the respondent is concerned.
We have perused the judgment impugned and the materials brought on record viz. the charge memo
and the orders passed by the disciplinary authority as also the appellate authority and are satisfied
that no interference is required with the order passed by the learned Single Judge.
There is no merit in this appeal and the same is dismissed.
