https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018
2. Heard, Mr.Vinod Paul Tyagaraj David, the learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr.C.Kathiravan,
Special Government Pleader appearing for the first respondent and Mr.M.Baskar, Standing Counsel
appearing for the respondents.
3. The petitioners have challenged the acquisition proceedings on the ground that the physical
possession has not been taken over and not paid compensation. The petitioners have purchased
their respective properties only in the year 1997. Whereas, the subject land was acquired for
implementation of Ambattur Neighbourhood Scheme under the provisions under Section 4(1) of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894, which was approved by Government in GO.Rt.No.261 Housing
Department dated 23.10.1975. It was published in the Government Gazatte dated 12.11.1975. Draft
declaration under Section 6 of the Act was approved by the Government in GO.Ms.No.1525 Housing
and Urban Development Department dated 09.11.1978. It was published in the Government Gazatte
dated 10.11.1978.
Accordingly, award was passed on 01.02.1988 in Award No.1 of 1988. As per the award, the lands
stood in the name of one, Thiru.Asirvadham and the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 entire compensation amount was also paid to him. Thereafter,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21618993/ 2
S.Ravi vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 13 December, 2021
power of attorney of the said Asirvadham sold out the subject lands to various persons. Therefore,
all the petitioners are subsequent purchasers in the year 1997. They cannot challenge the acquisition
proceedings since they have no locus to challenge the same. In this regard, it is relevant to rely upon
the judgment reported in (2019) 10 SCC 229 in the case of Shiv Kumar and anr Vs Union of India
and ors, in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held as follows :-
“13. The definition of 'landowner' is in Section 3(r), the same is extracted hereunder:
3. Definition.-In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-- .....
(r) "landowner" includes any person,-- (i) whose name is recorded as the owner of the land or
building or part thereof, in the records of the authority concerned; or
(ii) any person who is granted forest rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest
Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (2 of 2007) or under
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 any other law for the time being
in force; or
(iii) who is entitled to be granted Patta rights on the land under any law of the State including
assigned lands; or (iv) any person who has been declared as such by an order of the court or
Authority;
Landowner is a person who is recorded as the owner of land or building. The record of date of
issuance of preliminary notification Under Section 11 is relevant. A purchaser after Section 11 cannot
be said to be a landowner within the purview of Section 3(r).
............................
21. Thus, under the provisions of Section 24 of the Act of 2013, challenge to acquisition proceeding
of the taking over of possession under the Act of 1894 cannot be made, based on a void transaction
nor declaration can be sought Under Section 24(2) by such incumbents to obtain the land. The
declaration that acquisition has lapsed under the Act of 2013 is to get the property back
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 whereas, the transaction once
void, is always a void transaction, as no title can be acquired in the land as such no such declaration
can be sought. It would not be legal, just and equitable to give the land back to purchaser as land
was not capable of being sold which was in process of acquisition under the Act of 1894. The Act of
2013 does not confer any right on purchaser whose sale is ab initio void. Such void transactions are
not validated under the Act of 2013. No rights are conferred by the provisions contained in the 2013
Act on such a purchaser as against the State.
22. 'Void is, ab initio,' a nullity, is inoperative, and a person cannot claim the land or declaration
once no title has been conferred upon him to claim that the land should be given back to him. A
person cannot enforce and ripe fruits based on a void transaction to start claiming title and
possession of the land by seeking a declaration Under Section 24 of the Act of 2013; it will amount to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21618993/ 3
S.Ravi vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 13 December, 2021
conferment of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 benefit never
contemplated by the law. The question is, who can claim declaration/rights Under Section 24(2) for
the restoration of land or lapse of acquisition. It cannot be by a person with no title in the land. The
provision of the Act of 2013 cannot be said to be enabling or authorizing a purchaser after Section 4
to question proceeding taken under the Act of 1894 of taking possession as held in U.P. Jal Nigam
(supra) which is followed in M. Venkatesh (supra) and other decisions and consequently claim
declaration Under Section 24 of the Act of 2013. What cannot be done directly cannot be permitted
in an indirect method.
23. The provisions of the Act of 2013 aimed at the acquisition of land with least disturbance to the
landowners and other affected families and to provide just and fair compensation to affected
families whose land has been acquired or proposed to be acquired or are affected and to make
adequate provisions for such affected persons for their rehabilitation
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 and resettlement. The provisions
of Act of 2013 aim at ousting all inter-meddlers from the fray by ensuring payment in the bank
account of landholders Under Section 77 of the Act.
24. The intendment of Act of 2013 is to benefit farmers etc. Subsequent purchasers cannot be said to
be landowners entitled to restoration of land and cannot be termed to be affected persons within the
provisions of Act of 2013. It is not open to them to claim that the proceedings have lapsed Under
Section 24(2).”
4. In the above judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held that challenging the acquisition
proceedings under the provision of Section 24 of the New Act cannot be made, based on a void
transaction nor declaration to get the property back. The transaction once void, is always a void
transaction, as no title can be acquired in the land as such, no such declaration can be sought. It
would not be legal, just and equitable to give the land back to the purchaser as land was not capable
of being sold which was in process of acquisition under the Act of 1894. Therefore, the New Act does
not confer any right on purchaser whose sale is ab initio void.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 Therefore the petitioners cannot
challenge the acquisition proceedings being the subsequent purchasers.
5. That apart, the grounds raised by the petitioners in these Writ Petitions have already been settled
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of
Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., which held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21618993/ 4
S.Ravi vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 13 December, 2021
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue
as provided under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 1894 as if it has
not been repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has
not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession
has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse. Similarly, if
compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not
include a deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is
provided in proviso to Section 24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to
majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of
notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to
compensation in https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018
accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013. In case the obligation under
Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled, interest under
Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of compensation (in court)
does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit
with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under
the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date of notification for
land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section
31(1) of the Act of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed
under Section 24(2) due to non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court.
The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land
owners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher
compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is
by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession
under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21618993/ 5
S.Ravi vs The Principal Secretary To Government on 13 December, 2021
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section
24(2).
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 legality of concluded proceedings
of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of enforcement of the Act
of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded
proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen
proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate
acquisition.”
6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India settled all proposition of law in the above judgment
including the grounds raised by the petitioners.
The possession of the properties has already been taken over by the Government and handed over to
the requisitioning body and the compensation was also paid. Therefore, the petitioners failed to
satisfy the twin requirements under Section 24 (2) of the New Act i.e., the physical possession of the
land was not taken and the compensation has not been paid/tendered/deposited in accordance with
law. In view of the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the issues raised by the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis WP.Nos.16842 to 16847 of 2018 petitioner were settled and
therefore, the acquisition proceedings have not been lapsed by operation of law under Section 24 (2)
of the New Act i.e., Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. In view of the settled position of law, the writ petitions
are devoid of merits and liable to be dismissed.
7. Accordingly, all the writ petitions are dismissed. However, the petitioners are at liberty to
approach the authority concerned for reconveyance of their subject properties in the manner known
to law.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. No order as to costs.
