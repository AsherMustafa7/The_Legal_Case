Defence Plea:
5. The defence plea of appellants is that the victim was

Munda and the appellant Mukuna @ Dhanu @ Dhanuram Kerei
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 9

and on seeing them, when D.W.3 shouted, those two persons,
who were talking with the victim fled away and since the victim
was assaulted by D.W.3, a false case has been foisted against
the appellants.
Six witnesses were examined on behalf of the
defence in support of the defence plea including both the
appellants as D.W.5 and D.W.6.
Finding of the Trial Court:
6. The learned trial Court after analyzing the oral and
documentary evidence on record and on a conjoint reading of the

entry in school admission register, ossification test report and
versions of the teacher and the doctor found the victim to be
below eighteen years of age as on the date of occurrence. The
learned trial Court accepted the evidence of the victim and held
that there is consistency in the F.I.R. story, 164 Cr.P.C.
statement of the victim and the testimony of the victim relating
to forcible sexual intercourse on her and that she was subjected
to gang rape is amply corroborated by medical evidence and that
the testimony of the victim has not been demolished in any way.
The learned trial Court disbelieved the defence plea and taking
into account the presumption prescribed under section 29 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 10
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
POCSO Act came to hold that the prosecution has successfully
established the charge under section 6 of the POCSO Act. It was
further held that the prosecution has also successfully
established the ingredients of the offences punishable under
sections 376-D/506/450 of the I.P.C. against the appellants and
accordingly found them guilty.
Contentions of the Parties:
7. On 13.09.2023, when the matter was taken up for
hearing, the previously engaged counsel Mr. Susanta Kumar
Rout was not present to argue JCRLA No.14 of 2021, for which
Mr. Bibhuti Ranjan Mohanty was engaged as Amicus Curiae for

the appellant Dabu @ Santosh Kumar Munda and a copy of the
paper book was supplied to him for preparation.
Mr. Bibhuti Ranjan Mohanty, learned Amicus Curiae
appearing for the appellant Dabu @ Santosh Kumar Munda (in
JCRLA No.14 of 2021) and Mr. Satyajit Mukherjee, learned
counsel for the appellant Mukuna @ Dhanu @ Dhanuram Karei
(in CRLA No.135 of 2021) contended that the learned trial Court
was not justified in coming to the conclusion that the victim was
minor as on the date of occurrence. Though the school admission
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 11
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
register of the victim was proved but there is no material as to
on what basis the date of birth was entered into in the school
admission register, moreover from the evidence of the mother of
the victim, who was examined as P.W.1, it appears that the
victim was more than eighteen years as on the date of
occurrence. Learned counsel further argued that the victim's
statement that the appellants entered into the room through the
window which was of the dimension 1 feet X 1 feet appears to be
an improbable story and moreover, the I.O. has not seized the
broken window and therefore, the access to the room where the
victim was sleeping in the occurrence night by the appellants is a
doubtful feature. Learned counsel further submitted that it is the
prosecution case that at the time of occurrence, the victim
(P.W.2) was sleeping with her cousin sister (P.W.4) in the same

room, but P.W.4 has not supported the prosecution case. Even
though it is the victim's evidence that both the appellants
committed sexual intercourse on her one after another for which
there was bleeding from her private part, but the doctor (P.W.9)
has not noticed any external injury over the body of the victim
and therefore, the prosecution case that the victim was
subjected to gang rape becomes suspicious and as such, it is a fit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 12
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
case where benefit of doubt should be extended in favour of the
appellants.
Mr. Rajesh Tripathy, learned Additional Standing
Counsel appearing for the State of Odisha, on the other hand,
supported the impugned judgment and contended that the
victim's evidence has remained unchallenged and the victim has
disclosed about the occurrence not only before her mother
(P.W.1) but also before her brother (P.W.3) and both of them
have supported the prosecution case. Learned counsel further
argued that the defence plea has not been taken in the 313
Cr.P.C. statements of the appellants and if it is the case of the
defence that it was D.W.3 who noticed two persons were talking
with the victim in an isolated place in the night, for which he
shouted and also assaulted the victim then it is not understood
as to why D.W.3 was left out by the victim being implicated as
an accused in the case. Learned counsel further argued that the

victim's evidence regarding commission of rape on her is getting
corroboration from the medical evidence adduced by P.W.9, who
noticed tears in the hymen at 3, 6 and 12 O' clock position and
the hymen was found bleeding on touch and it was congested,
redness and tenderness were present and the doctor opined that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 13
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
the findings suggested that there was recent sexual intercourse
and the doctor clarified in the cross-examination that recent
sexual intercourse means there was intercourse within seven
days. Learned counsel further argued that both the appellants
were examined by the doctor who stated that they were capable
of committing sexual intercourse and the possibility of recent
sexual intercourse cannot be ruled out. Learned counsel further
submitted that in view of school admission register entry so also
the ossification test report, the learned trial Court has rightly
come to the conclusion that the victim was minor as on the date
of occurrence. Learned counsel further submitted that when the
occurrence took place in the intervening night of 18/19.03.2017,
the mother of the victim i.e. P.W.1 was not present in the house
and she returned back on the next day and came to know about
the occurrence and thereafter F.I.R. was drafted and accordingly
it was lodged on 20.03.2017 and as such there was no delay in
the lodging of F.I.R. and therefore, the conviction of the
appellants by the learned trial Court is quite justified.

8. At the outset, before dealing with the contentions of
the respective parties, it is felt necessary to point out a very
disturbing feature on record that in spite of repeated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 14
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
pronouncement of judgments by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on
section 228-A of the I.P.C. and in view of the provision under
section 33(7) of the POCSO Act, not to disclose the identity of
the child at any time during course of investigation or trial, the
name of the victim is mentioned in the deposition sheet.
In the case of State of Punjab -Vs.- Ramdev
Singh reported in (2004) 1 Supreme Court Cases 421, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has made the following observations:-
"3.....Section 228-A Indian Penal Code makes
disclosure of identity of the victim of certain
offences punishable. Printing or publishing name
or any matter which may make known the
identity of any person against whom an offence
under sections 376, 376-A, 376-B, 376-C or
376-D is alleged or is found to have been
committed can be punished. True it is the
restriction does not relate to printing or
publication of judgment by the High Court or the
Supreme Court, but keeping in view the social
object of preventing social victimization or
ostracism of the victim of a sexual offence for
which section 228-A has been enacted, it would
be appropriate that in the judgments, be it of

this Court High Court or lower courts, the name
of the victim should not be indicated. We have
chosen to describe her as "victim" in the
judgment."
In the case of Sangitaben Shaileshbhai Datanta
-Vs.- State of Gujarat reported in (2019) 14 Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 15
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
Court Cases 522, it is held as follows:-
"10. The concern of the legislature in protecting
the identity of the victim is further evident from
the provisions of POCSO Act. Section 33(7) of
the same casts a duty on the Special Court to
ensure that identity of the victim is not disclosed
at any time during the course of investigation or
trial. Further, Section 23 of POCSO Act provides
restriction on any form of media to disclose the
identity of the victim which tends to lower her
reputation or infringes upon her privacy. No
disclosure of any particular(s) is allowed which
can eventually lead to disclosure of the identity
of the victim."
In the case of Nipun Saxena and Another -Vrs.-
Union of India and Others reported in (2019) 2 Supreme
Court Cases 703, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as
follows:-
"9. Sub-section (1) of Section 228A, provides
that any person who makes known the name
and identity of a person who is an alleged victim

of an offence falling Under Sections 376, 376A,
376AB, 376B, 376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB or
376E commits a criminal offence and shall be
punishable for a term which may extend to two
years.
10. What is however, permitted under sub-
section (2) of Section 228-A Indian Penal Code
is making known the identity of the victim by
printing or publication under certain
circumstances described therein. Any person,
who publishes any matter in relation to the
proceedings before a Court with respect to such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 16
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
an offence, without the permission of the Court,
commits an offence. The Explanation however
provides that printing or publication of the
judgment of the High Courts or the Supreme
Court will not amount to any offence within the
meaning of the Indian Penal Code.
11. Neither the Indian Penal Code nor the Code
of Criminal Procedure define the phrase 'identity
of any person'. Section 228A Indian Penal Code
clearly prohibits the printing or publishing "the
name or any matter which may make known the
identity of the person". It is obvious that not
only the publication of the name of the victim is
prohibited but also the disclosure of any other
matter which may make known the identity of
such victim. We are clearly of the view that the
phrase "matter which may make known the

identity of the person" does not solely mean that
only the name of the victim should not be
disclosed but it also means that the identity of
the victim should not be discernible from any
matter published in the media. The intention of
the law makers was that the victim of such
offences should not be identifiable so that they
do not face any hostile discrimination or
harassment in the future.
12. A victim of rape will face hostile
discrimination and social ostracisation in society.
Such victim will find it difficult to get a job, will
find it difficult to get married and will also find it
difficult to get integrated in society like a normal
human being. Our criminal jurisprudence does
not provide for an adequate witness protection
programme and, therefore, the need is much
greater to protect the victim and hide her
identity. In this regard, we may make reference
to some ways and means where the identity is
disclosed without naming the victim. In one

case, which made the headlines recently, though
the name of the victim was not given, it was
stated that she had topped the State Board

out and establish her identity. In another

name of the village etc. is clearly visible. This
also amounts to disclosing the identity of the
victim. We, therefore, hold that no person can

disclose any facts which can lead to the victim
being identified and which should make her

The Hon'ble Supreme Court finally issued
the following direction:
"50.1. No person can print or publish in print,
electronic, social media, etc. the name of the
victim or even in a remote manner disclose any
facts which can lead to the victim being
identified and which should make her identity
known to the public at large."
In the deposition sheet of the victim of rape, the
learned trial Court has recorded the name of the victim, which
should not have been done. He/she should be mentioned as
'victim' therein. The signature of the victim in his/her deposition
should not be taken on the deposition sheet but should be taken
in a separate sheet by the learned trial Judge and the said sheet
of paper with the signature and certificate of the Judge with date
shall be kept in sealed cover. A noting should be given in the

followed while recording statement of the victim under section
164 of Cr.P.C. In the judgment, the name of the victim should
never be mentioned by the Judge.
Evidence of the victim and corroborating evidence:
9. In case of this nature, the evidence of the victim
(P.W.2) is most material and law is well settled that a
prosecutrix complaining of having been a victim of the offence of
rape is not an accomplice and there is no rule of law that her
testimony cannot be acted upon without corroboration in
material particulars. She stands on a higher pedestal than an
injured witness.
P.W.2 has stated that on the occurrence night, she
along with her cousin sister (P.W.4) were sleeping in one room
and her brother (P.W.3) was sleeping in another room. She
further stated that the appellant Dhanu entered inside the room
after breaking railings of the window and switched off the light
and then the appellant Dhanu gagged her mouth and both the

appellants lifted her and took her to outside of her house by
unbolting the entrance door and then they removed her wearing
apparels and they also became naked and then they committed
sexual intercourse on her one after another. She further stated
that due to sexual intercourse, blood was oozing out from her

private part and the appellants threatened her to take away her
life for which out of fear, she rushed to her house holding her
wearing apparels. She further stated that her sister (P.W.4)
unbolted the door and she went inside the house and narrated
the incident before her sister and that her mother (P.W.1)
returned home on the next day at about 4.00 p.m. and she also
narrated the incident before her. In the cross-examination, the
victim has stated that the appellant Dhanu was her uncle as per
village courtesy and appellant Santosh was her maternal uncle
as per village courtesy. She further stated that the appellants
entered into the room through window and the height of the said
window was about six feet from the ground level and the
dimension of the window was 1 feet X 1 feet. She further stated
that she had no knowledge about the breaking of the window
and when she got up, she found light was off and the appellant
Santosh switched off the light. She denied the suggestion given
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 20
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
by the learned defence counsel that she had got illicit
relationship with some other persons and while the accused
persons caught them red handed, she and her family members
have foisted a false case against the appellants. Nothing has
been brought out in the cross-examination of the victim to
disbelieve her evidence.

The evidence of victim has not been corroborated by
P.W.4, who has not supported the prosecution case and declared
hostile by the prosecution.
P.W.3 Sanjaya Munda, the brother of the victim has
stated that on the occurrence night, the victim knocked the door
and when it was unbolted, the victim was found to be holding her
undergarments with her hands and upper dress was torn and the
victim disclosed that the appellants had committed sexual
intercourse on her forcibly one after another and at that time, his
mother (P.W.1) was absent. P.W.3 has specifically stated that
they did not take any step to lodge F.I.R. at police station and
waited for the arrival of his mother, who returned on the Sunday
evening and they narrated the incident before his mother, who
went to the police station with Grama Rakhi of their village and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 21
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
thereafter the matter was reported at the police station. Nothing
has been brought out in the cross-examination of P.W.3 to
disbelieve his evidence.
The mother of the victim being examined as P.W.1
has stated that after her arrival in the house on 19.03.2017 at
about 4.00 p.m., the victim and P.W.4 disclosed before her about
the occurrence. She further stated that she narrated the incident
before the Grama Rakhi and they went to Keonjhar Sadar police

station and the F.I.R. was scribed by the Grama Rakhi as per her
version and then it was lodged.
The disclosure made by the victim (P.W.2) first
before P.W.3 and then before P.W.1 is very much relevant and it
is admissible as res gestae under section 6 of the Evidence Act.
Law is well settled that to be relevant under section 6 of the
Evidence Act, such statement must have been made
contemporaneously with the fact in issue, or at least immediately
thereupon and in conjunction therewith. If there is an interval
between the fact in issue and the fact sought to be proved then
such statement cannot come within 'res gestae' concept.
After the F.I.R. was lodged on 20.03.2017, the victim
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 22
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
was sent for medical examination and P.W.9, the Medical Officer
at District Headquarters Hospital, Keonjhar examined the victim
on 20.03.2017 and found that hymen had tears at 3, 6 and 12 O'
clock position and it was bleeding on touch and the hymen was
congested, redness and tenderness were present. The doctor
further stated that the ossification test report of the victim
indicated that she was fourteen to sixteen years at the time of
his examination and the findings suggested that there was recent
sexual intercourse on the victim. He proved the ossification
report marked as Ext.9/2 and his own report marked as Ext.9. In
the cross-examination, the doctor has stated that recent sexual

intercourse means there was intercourse within seven days and
he could not say the exact time of sexual intercourse and that he
had given the ossification report basing on x-ray report.
Therefore, the evidence of the victim regarding commission of
rape is getting corroboration not only from the oral evidence of
P.W.1 and P.W.3 but also from the medical evidence.
The appellants were sent for medical examination
and P.W.8 examined them on 21.03.2017 and both the
appellants were found to be capable of sexual intercourse and
the doctor opined that the possibility of sexual intercourse
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 23
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
cannot be ruled out. The reports have been marked as Ext.7 and
Ext.8 respectively.
Delay in lodging of F.I.R.:
10. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the
State that delay in lodging of the F.I.R. has been successfully
explained by the prosecution inasmuch as the occurrence took
place in the midnight of 18/19.03.2017. The victim along with
her cousin sister (P.W.4) and brother (P.W.3) were only present
in the house. The mother of the victim was not present in the
house at that time and therefore, everybody waited for the
arrival of the mother (P.W.1) and after P.W.1 returned on the
next day in the afternoon, she came to know about the

occurrence and the F.I.R. was drafted and then lodged before the
police station.
In view of the nature of accusation and since in case
of this nature, the family members used to take time to decide
whether to lodge the F.I.R. and proceed with the case or not and
therefore delay in such cases does not necessarily indicate that
the F.I.R. was tainted or it was deliberate or intentional to falsely
implicate the appellants in the commission of crime and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 24
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
therefore, I am of the view of the prosecution has successfully
explained the delay, if any, in lodging the F.I.R.
Age of the victim:
11. So far as age of the victim is concerned, the victim
being examined as P.W.2 has stated that she could not correctly
say about her age. The Court assessed her age to be sixteen
years and mentioned in deposition sheet. The ossification test
report which has been proved by the doctor (P.W.9) indicated
that the age of the victim was fourteen to sixteen years at the
time of examination. The Headmaster of the school where the
victim was prosecuting her study being examined as P.W.5 has
stated that during course of investigation, the police seized the
school admission register and the relevant entry so far as the
date of birth of the victim is concerned was at page no.80 and it
was mentioned to be 15.05.2001. Since the occurrence took

place on 18.03.2017 night, therefore, the conjoint reading of
school admission register and the ossification test report indicate
that the victim was minor as on the date of occurrence. No doubt
mother of the victim being examined as P.W.1 has stated that
her marriage was solemnized twenty two years back and her son
was her eldest child and he was born one year after her
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153300083/ 25
Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
marriage and after her eldest child was aged about two years,
the victim was born and that she could not say the date of birth
of the victim, but in view of the school admission register
coupled with ossification test report, I am of the humble view
that the findings of the learned trial Court that the victim was
minor as on the date of occurrence is quite justified.
Analysis of defence plea:
12. Coming to the defence plea of the appellants, in the
313 Cr.P.C. statements of both the appellants, no such specific
plea has been taken rather the plea was of complete denial and
false implication. However, six witnesses were examined on
behalf of the defence. The defence plea cannot be based on
surmises and speculation though the burden can be discharged
by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of the plea
either by adducing positive evidence or by reference to
circumstances transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself.

D.W.3 Ramrai Munda, who is the elder brother of the
appellant Dabu @ Santosh Kumar Munda has stated that he had

when he shouted, those two persons fled away and he along

victim by giving slaps and at that time, the other appellant was
also present. He further stated that he disclosed about the
incident to the informant. However, the informant (P.W.1) has
not stated about any such disclosure being made by D.W.3.
The appellant Mukuna @ Dhanu @ Dhanuram Kerei
being examined as P.W.6 has stated that he along with D.W.3
had been to pond where they found the victim was engaged in a
compromising condition with two persons and seeing them,
those persons fled away for which they abused the victim and
assaulted her by giving slaps. D.W.6 has not stated about the
presence of appellant Dabu @ Santosh Kumar Munda at the
spot. Similarly, D.W.3 has stated that the victim was talking with
two persons whereas D.W.6 has stated that the victim was in a
compromising condition with those two persons. If D.W.3
marked the victim in the company of two persons, shouted and
assaulted the victim and also informed the informant (P.W.1), it

is not understood as to why the victim left him being implicated
in the case. In view of these discrepancies, the learned trial
Court has rightly not placed any reliance on the defence plea.

Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
Conclusion:
13. Law is well settled that if the evidence of the victim
in a case of rape appears to be clear, trustworthy and above
board, the conviction can be sustained on the sole testimony of
the victim. In this case, the evidence of the victim has remained
unchallenged and it clearly points out the complicity of both the
appellants in the commission of gage rape on her. The evidence
of victim's mother (P.W.1) and brother (P.W.3) corroborates the
evidence of the victim before whom the victim has made
disclosure about commission of rape on her by the appellants
and moreover, the medical evidence also corroborates about the
commission of rape on the victim.
In view of the foregoing discussion, I find that both
the appellants not only committed trespass into the house of the
victim in the midnight but also committed gang rape on her and
committed the act of criminal intimidation. The learned trial
Court has rightly found the appellants guilty under the offences
charged and the sentence imposed for the offence under section
376-D of the I.P.C. i.e. for twenty years is the minimum

punishment prescribed for such offence and the sentence

Dabu @ Santosh Kumar vs State Of Odisha on 28 March, 2024
awarded for the other offences i.e. sections 506 and 450 of the
I.P.C. is quite justified. Accordingly, the conviction of the
appellants and sentence awarded by the learned trial Court is
upheld.
In the result, both the Jail Criminal Appeal and the
Criminal Appeal being devoid of merits, stand dismissed.
Lower Court Records with a copy of this judgment be
sent down to the learned trial Court forthwith for information and
necessary action.
The Registry shall place the judgment before Hon'ble
the Chief Justice seeking permission to circulate the copies of
this judgment to all the District Judges for onward circulation
