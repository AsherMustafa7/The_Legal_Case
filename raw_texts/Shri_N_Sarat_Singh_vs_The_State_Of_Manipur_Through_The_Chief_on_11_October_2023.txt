WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |3 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV)
Heard Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and Mr.
N. Jotendro, learned senior counsel for the petitioners in WP(C) No. 828 of 2022; Mr. H. Debendra,
learned Deputy AG assisted by Mr. I. Amri, learned counsel for the respondent State and Mr. M.
Rarry, the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Lokayukta in both the Respondents. Inspite
of notice none appeared for the respondent No. 2 and 3/complainant.
2. W.P.(C) No.833 of 2022 has been filed by the petitioners for issuance of a writ of mandamus to
close the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 pending on the file of the Manipur Lokayukta as not
maintainable being hit by limitation.
3. W.P.(C) No.828 of 2022 has been filed by the petitioner to set aside the Complaint Case No.5 of
2022 along with its order dated 8.9.2022 and its subsequent orders passed in the said complaint
case pending on the file of the Manipur Lokayukta in view of Section 53 of the Manipur Lokayukta
Act, 2014, as the complaint with regard to the alleged offence in connection with the construction of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 2
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
associated 33 KV transmission line for the project had been made after the expiry of a period of
seven years from the WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |4 date on which the
construction of associated 33 KV transmission line for the project had been completed and
commissioned after successfully tested on 14.8.2015 and taken over by the petitioner on the same
day.
4. Since the relief sought in these writ petitions is one and the same, both the writ petitions were
taken up together and disposed of by this common order.
5. Mr. HS Paonam, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that a Complaint Case
No.2 of 2020 was registered by the Manipur Lokayukta and, on 7.2.2022, an order was passed in the
said complaint case directing for investigation into the matter by registration of an FIR against some
officials including the petitioners and also a direction was given to remove the petitioner Sarat Singh
from his post pending investigation. Challenging the order dated 7.2.2022, W.P.(C) No.168 of 2022
and other connected writ petitions are filed. Pending W.P.(C) No.168 of 2022 and other connected
writ petitions, one Meghachandra Singh had filed PIL No.10 of 2022 for implementation of the
recommendation made by the Manipur Lokayukta in its judgment dated 7.2.2022 and by the
judgment and order dated 25.7.2022, the said PIL No.10 of 2022 was dismissed as withdrawn.
Another WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |5 W.P.(C) No.660 of 2022 has
been filed by one Mutum Waiojit Meitei against the State and the petitioner Sarat Singh for issuance
of quo warranto contending that the extension of the service of the petitioner Sarat Singh, after
retirement in the post of MD, MSPCL, is against the provisions of the recruitment rules coupled with
a prayer for removal from the post. The petitioner Sarat Singh and the State took a stand in the said
writ petition that the continuation of the petitioner Sarat Singh in the post of MD, MSPCL was not
by way of extension of service after retirement, but by way of appointment on contract basis
pursuant to the public advertisement at national level which was resorted to by the authorities as
per the rules.
6. The learned senior counsel further submitted that one such complaint seems to have been filed
before the Manipur Lokayukta by the respondent Ngangom Ibotombi Singh in Complaint Case No.5
of 2022. Without ascertaining the veracity and the documents for substantiating the allegation in
the complaint, the Manipur Lokayukta initiated action even to the extent of invoking power under
Section 22 of the said Act demanding information from the Power Department as enumerated in its
order dated 8.9.2022. Vide letter dated 14.9.2022, the Power Department WP(C) No. 833 of 2022
and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |6 directed the office of the petitioner Sarat Singh to make
available the documents.
7. The learned senior counsel submitted that during examination, it has come to know that the
alleged complaint relating to construction of associated 33 KV line for the turn-key project was
completed on 14.8.2015 and as 7 years have lapsed, it has become an issue which cannot be looked
into by the Manipur Lokayukta and accordingly, the Power Department was apprised and
subsequently, it seems that the Power Department has been pleased to inform the Manipur
Lokayukta that the complaint is time barred in view of Section 53 of the said Act and a request has
been made not to proceed with the proposed enquiry. However, without appreciating the stand of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 3
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
the Power Department, the Manipur Lokayukta has passed an order on 23.9.2022 directing to make
available all the documents by 10.10.2022.
8. The learned senior counsel next submitted that the complaint case was filed before the Manipur
Lokayukta not on the basis of the authenticated documents and information, but by some summary
information provided by some individual working in the Department for meeting his vested interest.
In order to bring such nefarious activities of some employees working in the Department WP(C) No.
833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |7 sponsoring unfounded complaint, an application
has been made by the petitioner Bimol Singh, who was the then DGM, Sub-station Division No.III
stating that the alleged complaint relating to the construction of associated 33KV line was already
completed as far back as 14.8.2015 and the non-execution of sending end bay for the project as
alleged in the complaint is irrelevant since in the work order for the project, there is no provision for
execution of sending end bay at New Chayang. When the counsel went to the Manipur Lokyukta for
filing such application, it was informed by the official of the Manipur Lokayukta that the application
filed is returned on the instruction of the Chairperson for the reason that even the preliminary
enquiry has not been commenced and being premature. According to the learned senior counsel,
returning the said application is against the accepted norms.
9. The learned senior counsel further submitted that despite the fact that the work was completed in
August, 2015, the Manipur Lokayukta not appreciating the stand of the Government,has been
insisting on making enquiry which otherwise is outside its jurisdiction, thereby making it clear that
it has become an instrument at the hands of persons who indulged in making complaints on
surmises and information provided against the official documents and records. Hence, the
petitioners have approached WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |8 this Court
for interference stating that the systematic harassment in the name of investigation/enquiry at the
behest of the some vested interested individual is to be prevented.
10. The learned senior counsel urged that the petitioner Sarat Singh whose contract appointment to
the post of MD, MSPCL has been over by March, 2023, however, he has become a victim of
unfounded allegation initiated by the staged complaint before different forums by vested interested
officials.
11. Mr. N. Jotendro, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.828 of 2022
submitted that taking cognizance of the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 for the alleged offence after
seven years is illegal, malafide and arbitrary in nature in view of Section 53 of the said Act. As such,
the complaint case along with its order dated 8.9.2022 and the subsequent orders passed thereon
are liable to be quashed.
12. Adding further, the learned senior counsel submitted that the petitioner was working and
discharging his duty as Deputy General Manager (DGM), Transmission Division-III at the time of
taking over the project on 14.8.2015 and that the completed transmission line facility has also taken
over by the petitioner Rajendra Sharma, DGM, TD-III, Manipur State Power Company WP(C) No.
833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 Page |9 Limited on the same day on 14.8.2015. Without
looking into the provision of the said Act, the Manipur Lokayukta has taken cognizance of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 4
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 on 8.9.2022 and, therefore, the same is liable to be quashed.
13. Mr. M. Rarry, the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Lokayukta submitted that no
cause of action have arisen for filing the writ petitions and the writ petitioners are premature. The
impugned orders are not adverse to the interest of any person, as the decision as to who are to be
arrayed as respondents in the preliminary enquiry is yet to be decided. In other words, the writ
petitions have been filed based on the pre-conceived presumption to illegally and malafidely to stop
the quasi-judicial authority from discharging its function, though Lokayukta functioning being
directly investigative in nature as declared by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of Nagendra Nath Bora v. Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals. The petitioners have
no locus standi to challenge the impugned orders or the complaint case, as the case may be. They
cannot step into the shoes of other State Government officers' who were called to produce
documents as per the provisions of the said Act. The petitioners are not aggrieved parties in law, as
the impugned orders do not in any manner affect the fundamental rights of the petitioners to invoke
the WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 10 writ jurisdiction. The petitioners
have not approached this Court with clean hands and are guilty of concealing material facts and
documents. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petitions.
14. Heard the learned Government Advocate for the respondent State.
15. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
16. As could be seen from the records, before filing the present writ petitions, challenging the order
dated 7.2.2022 passed by the Manipur Lokayukta in Complaint Case No.2 of 2020, the petitioner
Sarat Singh filed W.P.(C) No.168 of 2022 to set aside the order dated 7.2.2022. Similar writ petition,
being W.P.(C) No.161 of 2022, has been filed by Th. Kamiinimohan Singh challenging the order
dated 7.2.2022. Th. Bimol Singh also filed W.P.(C) No.171 of 2022 assailing the said order. In
addition, the petitioner Sarat Singh filed W.P.(C) No.255 of 2022 restraining the Manipur
Lokayukta from taking any action for implementation of its recommendation at para 25(D) made in
the order dated 7.2.2022. Though the petitioners in the said writ petitions insisted for an WP(C) No.
833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 11 interim order, by the common order dated
4.7.2022, the learned Single Judge of this Court has not granted any interim order.
17. W.P.(C) Nos.833 and 828 of 2022 have been filed by petitioners for issuance of direction to close
the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 on the ground that the same is barred by limitation. In the said
writ petitions, the petitioners have also sought for an order restraining the Manipur Lokayukta from
proceeding with the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 pending disposal of the writ petitions.
18. On 29.9.2022, when W.P.(C) No.833 of 2022 was taken up for hearing, this Court passed the
following order:
"[1] Heard Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and perused the
record.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 5
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
[2] Mr. HS Paonam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner argued the case that
prima facie the compliant taken by the Manipur Lokayukta in complaint case No. 5 of
2022 is not at all maintainable only on the ground that as per the Section 53 of
Manipur Lokayukta Act if the alleged occurrence was lapsed for 7(seven) years, the
complaint should not be taken by the Lokayukta. Mr. H.S Paonam, learned senior
counsel for the petitioner further raised another ground that in order dated
23.09.2022, the Manipur Lokayukta WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of
2022 P a g e | 12 has passed an order in which in para No.9 of order dated
23.09.2022 which read as follows:
"Put up the case on 10.10.2022 for the personal appearance of (i) Administrative
Secretary, Department of Power, Government of Manipur and (ii) Mrs.
OrjubalaHaorongbam, Deputy Secretary (power) Government of Manipur on
10.10.2022 at 11:00 am, However of the Manipur Lokayukta Act, the learned
Lukayukta have no power to issue any notice for personal appearance of the
Administrative office concerned. But by the order dated 23.09.2022 of the learned
Manipur Lokayukta directly issued order for personal appearance of the
Administrative officer.
Therefore, once the complaint itself is not maintainable one before the Lokayukta and order dated
23.09.2022 is also not maintainable one. [3] Mr. Mr. Rarry, learned Standing counsel represented
the petitioner has not served case papers to him before taking up the matter for admission since he
is the standing counsel for the Manipur Lokayukta. Anyhow, Mr. H. S Paoanam , learned senior
counsel for the petitioner has given all the paper to Mr. M. Rarry, learned standing counsel in the
open Court.
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 13 [4] After gone through the writ
petition and documents, Mr. M. Rarry, learned Standing counsel for the Manipur Lokayukta
represented the compliant case is not taken for registration as on date by the Manipur Lokayukta
and the very file of the writ petition is premature one. Therefore, for proper instruction from the
Manipur Lokayukta and for filing counter affidavit, he seeks time. [5] Mr. HS Paonam learned
senior counsel for the petitioner has produced certificate dated 14.08.2015 which read as follows:
Handing over/Taking Over (Certificate) Date 14/08/2015 Project: Installation of 2x5
MVA, 33/11 kV Sub-Station along with the associated 33 KV line and related Civil
works at Sugnu in Thoubal District on turn-key basis.

With reference to the above mentioned LOA/Work Order, the construction activities

Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
Gurgaon, and the line has been successfully tested and commissioned on 14/08/2015
in presence of MSPCL officials. The completed transmission line facility is taken over
by the WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 14 Dy. General
Manager, TD-IIl, Manipur State Power Company Limited (MSPCL) on this day i.e.,
14/08/2015.
'For and behalf of For and Behalf of
Manipur State Power Shyama Power
Company Limited India Limited.
DGM, TD-III Project manager
(taken over) (handing over)
[6] As per the above certificate dated 14.08.2015 issued by Shyama Power India
Limited which was handing over/taking over on 14.08.2015, it is made clear that as
per the Section 53 of the Manipur Lokayukta Act, 2014, the complaint is time barred
one. Apart from this the learned Lokayukta has no right to pass any order for the
personal appearance officers concerned as ordered 23.09.2022.
[7] Therefore, prima facie of the petitioner is made out the case before this Court.
[8] Accordingly, this writ petition is admitted. [9] Notice to the respondents. Since Mr. Rarry,
learned counsel takes notice for the Lokayukta, no formal notice is required.
[10] Post this matter on 20.10.2022.
[11] Till such time, there shall be an order of interim stay of the order dated 23.09.2022 passed by
learned Manipur Lokayukta.
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 15 [12] Print the name of Mr. Rarry in
the cause list."
19. The Manipur Lokayukta filed MC (WP) No.346 of 2022 to vacate the said interim order dated
29.09.2022. After hearing the respective learned counsel, this Court, by the order dated 19.12.2022,
dismissed MC (WP) No.346 of 2022. Paragraphs 28 and 29 of the said order are relevant and the
same are quoted hereunder:
"28. Nothing has been produced by the petitioners to show that as against the interim
order date 22.12.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.938 of 2022, an appeal has been
preferred. In view of the said interim order passed in W.P.(C) No.938 of 2022
thereby restraining the enquiry officer from taking further proceedings and
consequential action in respect of Complaint Case No.5 of 2022, no contra view is
possible in this case, as no appeal has been preferred against the interim order dated
22.11.2022 passed in W.P.(C) No.938 of 2022.

Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
29. For the foregoing discussions, this Court is of the view that thee is no merit in MC
(W) No.346 of 2022 and accordingly dismissed and thus, the interim order dated
29.9.2022 passed in W.P.(C) no.833 of 2022 is made absolute till the disposal of the
writ petition."
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 16
20. Aggrieved by the dismissal of MC (WP) No.346 of 2022, Manipur Lokayukta had preferred
S.L.P.(C) No.2069 of 2023 before the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Apex Court, vide order
dated 3.2.2023, disposed of the SLP. The order of the Apex Court reads thus:
"Noticing that by the impugned order that the High Court has made the interim order
absolute, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. Without
expressing any view on the merits of the contentions of the parties, we only request
the High Court to dispose of the writ petition itself within a period of three months
from the date of production of the copy of this order before the High Court.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of."
21. According to the petitioners, the execution of associated 33 KV transmission line pursuant to the
letter of award dated 2.7.2014 which is the prime focus of allegation of the complainant in the
complaint has been successfully completed and after following the due process as per the procedure,
including WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 17 testing and
commissioning in the presence of MSPCL official, handing over and taking over of the completed
work was done on 14.8.2015 between the executing agency, namely M/s.Shyama Power (India)
Private Limited and the MSPCL, represented by its DGM, Transmission Division-III (petitioner in
W.P.(C) No.828 of 2022). Thus, it is the specific case of the petitioners that the complaint filed
before the Manipur Lokayukta in respect of associated 33 KV transmission line of the project was
only on 31.08.2022. Therefore, the Manipur Lokayukta has no authority to enquire into the matter
based on the said complaint. Reliance is placed on Section 53 of the said Act.
22. Section 53 of the said Act reads thus:
"53. The Lokayukta shall not inquire or investigate into any complaint, if the
complaint is made after the expiry of a period of seven years from the date on which
the offence mentioned in such complaint is alleged to have been committed."
23. On the other hand, it is the say of the Manipur Lokayukta that if the completion of the project as
per the document dated 14.8.2015 is accepted to be correct, it would certainly justify the allegation
that the project for laying 33 KV transmission line of WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of
2022 P a g e | 18 20 kms. from 33/11/KV substation New Chayang to Sugnu had been commissioned
by tapping only 3 km. from the existing 33 KV new Chayang-Joupi line at Khongnang Paishabi and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 8
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
there was embezzlement of funds and materials for the remaining 17 kms. Thus as per the available
record, the complaint case is not barred by limitation. According to the learned counsel for the
Manipur Lokayukta, disputed question of facts ought not to be decided in the writ petition.
24. In reply, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that the project has three
components, namely (a) line portion - string of a new 33 KV associated transmission line; (b)
sub-station portion - installation of a new 2x5 MVA 33/11 sub- station; and (c) civil works. The
allegation in the complaint case is misappropriation of public fund due to non-execution of 17 km of
33 KV transmission line.
25. In the briefing report filed along with the complaint, the complainant has stated as under:
"The project "Installation of 2x5 MVA 33/11 KV substation at Sugnu along with
associated 33 KV line and related works in Thoubal, district was taken up by MSPCL
during the period 2014 to 2017 under NLCPR and state fund. /the approved WP(C)
No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 19 project cost is Rs.5.39 cr.
Minister of Doner accorded sanction of the fund for the project on 28.02.2014 as
revealed in the report "24x7 POWER FOR All- Manipur" A joint initiative of
Government Of India and Government Of Manipur". The statement in the report was
jointly signed by the than commissioner (Power), Manipur and the than Joint
Secretary (Power), GOI.
The project was executed by M/S Shyama Power India Pvt. Ltd. On turnkey basis.
The length of the associated 33 kv Transmission line fro 33/11 KV substation New
chayang to Sugunu as per the approved scheme is 20 twenty Km. However, the
substation has been commissioned by erecting a line of 3 km, tapping from the
existing 33 KV New chayang-Joupi line at KhongnangPaishabi. Embezzlement of the
fund released from Doner Ministry and the state government for supply and erection
of the balance 17 Km long 33 KV Transmission line and one 33 KV sending end bay
along with the equipmetns at 33 KV Substatiion, New chayang is evident. Many
mandatory equipmetns and elements for a power substations like Lightening
arrestors, Circuit Breakers and Isolators are also missing in the field. The civil works
like cable trench and the fencing et are also not as per standards.
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 20 The company failed
to produce the relevant records and information for the said project when asked for
by one RTI activist Joykumar Singh as published in Local media. Shri N.Sarat Singh,
Managing Director, MSPCL, has utilised all the funds including the sum sanctioned
for the works and supply for the 17 Kms of 33 KV line and the sending End Bay which
had not been constructed. The Managing Director, MSPCL, being the executive head
and drawing and disbursing officer of the company in collision with the consignee of
the project, the concern field Engineers and the Turn Key agency has intentionally
made room for short supply of materials, skip erection works and misappropriated
the public fund for their personal gains. The unauthorised change in the scope of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 9
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
work and supply, non execution of 17 kms of the 33 KV line and the sending end bay
but incurred expenditure of the said works and supply implies that embezzlement
and misappropriation of public fund has been committed."
26. According to the petitioners, the work schedule of the work order specifies different timelines for
completion of the work for line portion and substation portion. The completion of line portion is
independent of the other two components and the associated 33 KV line was completed and test
charged by 14.8.2015. According to the petitioners, the completion of the sub- WP(C) No. 833 of
2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 21 station portion is dependent on the completion of the
associated transmission line and the substation was subsequently completed on a later date. The
petitioners stated that the line component i.e. the associated 33 KV line was completed on 14.8.2015
and has never claimed that the whole project was completed by 14.8.2015.
27. It is not necessary that all the components have to be completed at the same point of time, as
each component will have different completion schedule specified in the work order as well. Since
the work schedule for the line portion where the allegation of misappropriation of fund is already
barred by limitation under Section 53 of the said Act, the respondent Manipur Lokayukta
deliberately misled by trying to broaden the ambit of the complaint in order to suit convenience. The
respondent cannot misconstrue a complaint alleging an offence of embezzlement and
misappropriation of public fund due to non-execution of 17 km of 33 KV transmission line and
sending end bay of New Chayang as the complaint against the project Installation of 2x5 MVA, 33/11
KV substation along with associated 33 KV line and related civil works at Sugnu in Thoubal District
on turn-key basis in a manner to suit without any basis.

28. The learned counsel for the Manipur Lokayukta submitted that even if the line portion of new 33
KV line of 20 kms. is shortened to only 3 kms., the line portion of 20 kms. was not completed on the
date mentioned by the petitioners on 14.8.2015 as the handing over/taking over certificate is not
available in the Government record and this shows that the said alleged handing over/taking over
certificate is a manufactured and doctored one.
29. In reply, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners submitted that the handing over/taking
over certification is a document executed between the implementing agency i.e. MSPCL and the
turn-key firm as per the agreement entered between the two parties. This document certifies the
completion of a portion of the work executed by the turn-key firm and that the turn-key firm has
executed the portion of the work as per the technical specification and certifies healthiness of the
completed portion of the work. However, the NLCPR guideline mandates submission of documents
like utilization certificates, quarterly progress report, inspection reports through the planning
department at the time of seeking funds for the subsequent instalments from the Ministry.
30. Drawing this Court's attention to the inspection report of the General Manager, Sub-station
Circle, who is the Nodal WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 23 Officer, the
learned senior counsel submitted that in the said report the Nodal Officer furnished the overall

Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
progress of the project in general which does not particularly specify the completion of each
component. Since sub-station and related civil works were not completed during the time of
inspection, the Nodal Officer had furnished a general status of the project even though the line
portion was completed quite beforehand. This Court finds some merit in the submission made by
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners.
31. The handing over/taking over certificate dated 14.8.2015 filed along with the writ petition reads
thus:
Handing Over/Taking Over (Certificate) Date: 14/08/2015 Project: Installation of
2x5 MVA, 33/11 kV Sub- station along with the associated 33 kV line and related Civil
Works at SugnuThoubal District on turn-key basis.
Ref: LOA No.4/109/33KV/SUG/13- ED(PURCH)706-17, dated 02/07/2014.
Name of Line: Associated 33 kV transmission line.
With reference to the above mentioned LOA/Work Order, the construction activities
of the associated 33 kV transmission line of the above project has been completed by
tapping from the existing 33 kV WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022
P a g e | 24 transmission line from New Chayang to Joupi in looping in - looping out
(LILO) configuration by M/s.Shyama Power India Limited, Gurgaon, and the line has
been successfully tested and commissioned on 14/08/2015 in presence of MSPCL
officials. The completed transmission line facility is taken over by the Dy. General
Manager, TD-III, Manipur State Power Company Limited (MSPCL) on this day i.e.
14/08/2015.

32. To controvert the handing over/taking over certificate dated 14/08/2015
produced by the petitioners, the respondent Manipur Lokayukta has not produced
any document. Therefore, it is clear that the execution of the associated 33 KV
transmission line pursuant to the letter of award dated 2.7.2014 which is the prime
focus of allegation of the complainant in the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 was
successfully completed and after following the due process including the testing and
commissioning in the presence of the officials of MSPCL, the handing over and taking
over of the completed work was done on 14.08.2015 between the executing WP(C)

No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 25 agency and the MSPCL.
Nobody has questioned the certificate of handing over/taking over till date.
33. As could be seen from the records, irrespective of the actual state of affairs which
may not be disputed about the completion of the project in the month of August,
2015, the Manipur Lokayukta without appreciating the stand of the Government,
called for personal appearance of the petitioners under the guise of enquiry which
prima facie is outside its jurisdiction.
34. It is settled law that under the guise of enquiry and/or investigation, the
authorities shall not harass the individual at the behest of the vested interested
persons.
35. As stated supra, Section 53 of the said Act bars the taking up of the complaint in
respect of the allegation of committing offence after the expiry of seven years. The
work in question was completed way back on 14.8.2015, however, the Complaint Case
No.5 of 2022 based on the complaint lodged by the Shri Ngangom Ibotombi Singh
against the petitioners and M/s.Syama Power (India) Private Limited was taken up
for adjudication on 8.9.2022 by the Manipur Lokayukta.
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 26
36. A perusal of the File produced by the parties in respect of Complaint Case No.5 of 2022, makes it
is clear that Shri Ngangom Ibotombi Singh has filed the complaint before the Manipur Lokayukta on
31.8.2022. According to the petitioners, the work in question was completed on 14.8.2015 and the
complaint as per the File was lodged on 31.8.2022, which is beyond the period of seven years as per
Section 53 of the said Act. The complainant Shri Ngangom Ibotombi Singh was impleaded as party
respondent in these writ petitions. Despite service, he has not appeared before this Court. Lodging
complaint before the Manipur Lokayukta and tracing evidence through the Manipur Lokayukta
cannot be permitted. It is the bounden duty of the complainant to produce all the records in support
of the complaint while filing the complaint case. However, in the case on hand, the complainant has
failed to do so. When the complainant is arrayed as party respondent in the writ petition and notice
served on him, it is his bounden duty to appear before the Court and put forth his stand.
37. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the Manipur Lokayukta submitted that the impugned
orders passed in the complaint case are not adverse to the interest of any person, as the decision as
to who are to be added as respondents in the preliminary enquiry is yet to be decided and that the
writ petitions WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 27 have been filed based
on the pre-conceived presumption. In the given facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be
said that the writ petitions are filed prematurely.
38. It is also the argument of the learned counsel for the Manipur Lokayukta that even a layman or a
common man will understand that the case of the complainant that the petitioners and others had
embezzled and misappropriated the fund for the project i.e. Installation of 2x5 MVA, 33/11 KV
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 12
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
Sub-station along with the associated KV line and related civil works at Sugnu in Thoubal District on
turn-key basis by stringing only 3 kms. of line that too by shortening the line portion from original
contract of 20 kms. and also not constructed the sub-station of the project has no legs, as either the
complainant or the Manipur Lokayukta proved the same.
39. It is true that the disputed question of fact cannot be decided in the writ petition, however, it is
the duty of the parties in the writ petition to prima facie prove their case. In the instant case, it is the
say of the petitioners that way back in August, 2015, the work was completed. To prove the same,
they have produced the handing over/taking over certificate. To disprove the said certificate, no
material has been produced by the respondent Manipur Lokayukta. No prima facie proof to show
the alleged WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 28 misappropriation of
funds by the petitioners as alleged by the respondent Manipur Lokayukta is placed on record. Under
the garb of enquiry/investigation, evidence cannot be traced out to suit a person and that the
authority of the Lokayukta cannot be misused.
40. As stated supra, as per Section 53 of the said Act, the Lokayukta shall not inquire into any
complaint, if the complaint is made after the expiry of a period of seven years from the date on
which the offence mentioned in such complaint is alleged to have been committed.
41. In the case on hand, the petitioners have established prima facie that line component i.e. the
associated 33 KV line, was completed on 14.8.2015. Thus, it is clear that the complaint is clearly
barred by limitation and in the time barred complaint, the Manipur Lokayukta cannot issue notices
under the guise of enquiry or verifying the records. Admittedly, the Manipur Lokayukta ought not to
have ordered enquiry, as the work was completed way back on 14.08.2015 and to that effect proof
has also been produced before this Court. In view of the above, the petitioners have legal right to
maintain the present writ petitions.
42. Section 14 of the Manipur Lokayukta Act, 2014 deals with the enquiry to be conducted into any
matter involved in or WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 29 arising from
or connected with any allegation of corruption made in the complaint by the Lokayukta. Section
14(1) of the Act provides:
"14. (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the Lokayukta shall inquire or
cause an inquiry to be conducted into any matter involved in, or arising from, or
connected with, any allegation of corruption made in a complaint in respect of the
following namely:-
(a) ...
(b) ...
(c) ...
(d) all officers and employees of the State, from
amongst the public servants defined in sub- clause (i) and (ii) of clause (c) of section
2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 when serving or who has served, in
connection with the affairs of the State;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/175327986/ 13
Shri N. Sarat Singh vs The State Of Manipur Through The Chief ... on 11 October, 2023
(e) all officers and employees referred to in clause (d) or equivalent in any body or
Board or corporation or authority or company or society or trust or autonomous body
(by whatever name called) established by an Act of the State Legislature or wholly or
partly financed by the State Government or controlled by it;
(f) ...
(g) ...
WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 P a g e | 30
(h) ..."
43. Thus, from the above, it is clear that a complaint before the Manipur Lokayukta by the
complainant against any authority, including the public office, needs to satisfy the condition
mentioned in Section 14(1) of the said Act. In the case on hand, as stated supra, the condition
stipulated in Section 14(1) of the said Act has not been fulfilled by the complainant and the said fact
was not properly analyzed by the Manipur Lokayukta while coming to the conclusion to issue notice
to the respondents therein for appearance and the production documents for preliminary enquiry.
That apart, expanding the scope of enquiry beyond the allegation made in the complaint is against
the objective of the said Act. Such intention to have a roving enquiry cannot be permitted.
44. It is also the submission of the learned senior counsel for the petitioners that with a good
intention, the petitioners have discharged their official function and, therefore, the petitioners have
to be protected by the provision of Section 50 of the Act.
45. Section 50 of the said Act provides:
"50. No suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings under this Act shall lie against
any public servant, in respect of anything WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828
of 2022 P a g e | 31 which is done in good faith or intended to be done in the
discharge of his official functions or in exercise of his powers."
46. Taking cognizance by the Manipur Lokayukta of a complaint filed by the complainant, who was a
retired IAS officer, against the petitioners beyond the statutory period as provided under Section 53
of the said Act and the non-consideration of the aspect of Section 50 of the said Act has infringed the
fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of
India.
47. A retired high functionary of the State Government cannot be accused by another retired high
functionary to meet personal agenda after a long time before the Lokayukta.

48. It is to be noted that the series of actions are undertaken by the Manipur Lokayukta in
connection with the Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 even though the aforesaid action purportedly has
taken in connection with altogether a different Complaint Case No.2 of 2020 and, as such, the claim
of bonafide is highly misplaced for not accepting the stand of the Government. As regards to the
issue raised in Complaint Case No.5 of 2022, it is WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of
2022 P a g e | 32 clear that the same is time barred and it would be out of the purview of the
Manipur Lokayukta as per the scheme of the said Act.
49. For all the reasons stated above,
a) Both the writ petitions WP(C) No. 833 of 2022 and WP(C) No. 828 of 2022 are allowed.
b) The Complaint Case No.5 of 2022 pending on the file of the Manipur Lokayukta against
petitioners is closed.
c) There will be no order as to costs.
