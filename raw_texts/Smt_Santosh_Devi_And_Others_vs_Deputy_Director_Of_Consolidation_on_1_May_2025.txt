of petitioners in the aforementioned largest original roadside plot is 1/2. Petitioners filed chak
objection under Section 21 (1) of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 hereinafter referred to
as U.P.C.H. Act claiming allotment over largest original roadside plot No. 1344. Consolidation

4. In pursuance of the order dated 2.3.2012, no counter affidavit has been filed by private
respondents.

holding which is situated adjacent to the highway. He submitted that proper pleading was made
before the consolidation authorities for allotment of chak on their largest original holding situated
adjacent to the road but all the three consolidation authorities have negatived the petitioner's claim
on misconceived ground to the effect that petitioner has been allotted other chak on their original
plots.

Standing Counsel for the State respondents submitted that no interference is required against the
concurrent judgement of all the three Courts passed in chak allotment proceeding, as such, the writ
petition is liable to be dismissed.

7. I have considered the arguments advanced by counsel for the parties and perused the records.
8. There is no dispute about the fact that plot No. 1344 is largest original holding of the petitioners
and the aforementioned plot is situated adjacent to the highway.
9. The perusal of C.H. Form 23 of the petitioner as well as private respondents and the orders
passed by the consolidation authorities fully demonstrate that petitioners have been deprived from
their largest original holding which is situated adjacent to the highway.
10. This court has held from time to time that original road side plot cannot be allotted to anybody
except to the original tenure holder or the same should be declared as C.H. 18. The relevant case law
for allotment of road side plot to original tenure holders are as under:
I. 993 R.D. 219 Raghuvansh Shukla Vs. Joint Director of Consolidation & others.
II. (2006) 100 RD 212 Ram Chandar Vs. Deputy Director of Consolidation Varanasi
& others.
III. (2020) 147 RD 219 Ram Badan Vs. D.D.C. & others.
11. Paragraph Nos. 15 and 16 of the judgment rendered by this Court in the case of Ram Badan
(Supra) will be relevant for perusal which is as under:
?15. The consensus of principle that emerges from the decisions in Ram Prasad
(supra), Ramadhar Singh (supra) and Sanjay and another (supra) is that valuable
roadside land that is the original holding of a tenure holder, is to be declared chak out
or allotted to him as part of his Chak, unless it be imperative on account of some
compelling circumstances that may require some marginal departure from the Rule.
There is no finding recorded by the Deputy Director of Consolidation or the
Settlement Officer that allotment of the entire area of Khasra No. 60/3 (old) to the
petitioner, that is part of the petitioner's original holding lies in front of the third
respondent's Abadi and would cause the third respondent some great inconvenience
or irreparable injury as spoken of in the decision of this Court in Ram Shanker
(supra). The remark of the Deputy Director of Consolidation that though it is not
appropriate to include any part of this plot in the third respondent's chak as it is not
part of his original holding, considering his Abadi, the same may not be disturbed as
ordered by the Settlement Officer of Consolidation, is flawed. To this, is added a
remark that, therefore, it would not be proper to remove the part of the plot in
dispute included in the Chak of the third respondent. For one, it is not reason enough
to deprive the petitioner of a substantial part of his valuable roadside land in favour
of the third respondent. Moreover, a look at the confirmed consolidation map shows
that between one part of old Khasra No. 60/3 (now renumbered as 369) and included
in the third respondent's chak and the third respondent's Abadi, there is a sector road
running through. This confirmed map is on record as part of Annexure No. SRA-1 to

Smt.Santosh Devi And Others vs Deputy Director Of Consolidation ... on 1 May, 2025
the supplementary rejoinder affidavit dated 18th July, 2019 filed on behalf of the
petitioner. There is no dispute about this.
16. The added fact that a sector road now runs through between those plots where the
third respondent claims his Abadi and old Khasra No. 60/3 that is the petitioner's
original holding, occurrence of even a slight prejudice to the third respondents, let
alone a compelling circumstance that may leave no option with the Authorities but to
deprive the petitioner of some part of his valuable roadside land, part of Khasra No.
60/3 (old), is a conclusion that cannot be said to be a legitimate exercise of discretion
by the Consolidation Authorities, one way. Here is a case where the Deputy Director
of Consolidation affirming the Settlement Officer of Consolidation has deprived the
petitioner of valuable roadside land in violation of settled legal principles that
valuable roadside land is either to be excluded from consolidation operations or
included in the Chak of that Chakholder, who held it as original holding. This
principle is to be departed from for very compelling reasons that are not forthcoming
in this case.?
12. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned revisional order dated
3.12.2011 passed by respondent no.1 in revision No. 817, 869 and 870 order dated 26.10.2010
passed by respondent no.2 and order dated 9.4.2010 passed by respondent no.3 are liable to be set
aside and the same are hereby set aside.
13. The writ petition stands allowed and matter is remitted back before respondent no.1, Deputy
Director of Consolidation, Saharanpur to register the revision Nos. 817, 870 and 869 on their
original number and decide the same afresh after issuing notice to all the parties in the
aforementioned revision expeditiously preferably within period of three months from the date of
production of certified copy of this order in the light of the observation made in the body of this
judgement.
14. No order as to costs.
