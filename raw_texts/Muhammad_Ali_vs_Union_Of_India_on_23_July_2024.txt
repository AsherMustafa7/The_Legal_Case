HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AHANTHEM BIMOL SINGH
For the petitioners :: Mr. Haaris Moosa, Advocate
For the respondents :: Mr. N. Brojendro, Advocate
Date of hearing :: 06-06-2024
Date of judgment & order :: 23-07-2024
JUDGMENT & ORDER
[1] Heard Mr. Haaris Moosa, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioners and Mr. N. Brojendro, learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
The present writ petition has been filed with the prayer for issuing a writ of Mandamus directing the
officers of the respondent No. 2 to return forthwith the gold jewelleries seized from the petitioners
as provided under section 110(2) of the Customs Act, 1962.
[2] The facts of the present case are not in dispute. On 23-02-2023, the petitioners No. 1, 2 and 4
were travelling to Guwahati and the petitioners No. 3 and 5 were travelling to Delhi and during the
pre-embarkation security check at the domestic terminal of Imphal International Airport, nine
items of jewellery were seized from them by the CISF personnel posted there and thereafter, handed
over to the Anti-Smuggling Unit, Customs Division, Imphal, which seized the said jewellery items as
empowered under section 110 of the Customs Act, 1962. The particulars and details of the seized
items are as under:-
WP( WP(C) No. 766 of 2023 Contd.../-
Petnr. Name Seized items
1 Mohammad Ali One gold bangle weighing 245 gm.

S/o Mohammed Sha V. chains, one silver colour coating

[3] Based on the said seizure dated 23-02-2023, a Show Cause

Muhammad Ali vs Union Of India on 23 July, 2024
Notice, as provided under section 124 of the Customs Act, 1962, dated 17-08-2023
was issued by the Addl. Commissioner of Customs and the same was dispatched on
25-08-2023 through speed post for delivery to the present petitioners.
Upon realising that the Show Cause Notice was not issued within the statutory period
of six months as provided under section 110(2) of the Customs Act, the petitioners
submitted a representation dated 26-09-2023 to the Chairman, Central Board of
Indirect Taxes and Customs, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance and the
Commissioner of Customs (Preventive), North Eastern Region, requesting for
releasing the seized gold jewelleries. As the authorities have failed to release the said
seized gold jewelleries despite the request made by the petitioners, the petitioners
approached this court by filing the present writ petition for redressing their
grievances.
WP(
WP(C) No. 766 of 2023 Contd.../-
[4] The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that section
110(1) of the Customs Act, 1962 confers power and jurisdiction on the proper Officer
of Customs to seize any goods with respect to which he has a reasonable belief that
the goods are liable for confiscation under the Act. It has also been submitted that
under sub-section (2) of section 110, it is provided that where any goods are seized
under sub-section (1) and no notice in respect thereof is given under clause (a) of
section 124 of the Act within six months of the seizure of the goods, the goods shall be
returned to the person from whose possession they were seized and that any further
retention of the seized goods will be rendered illegal as being ultra vires of the
provisions of section 110(2) of the Customs Act.
The learned counsel further submitted that the petitioners have approached the
concerned authorities many times with a request to release/ return the seized gold
jewelleries. However, all such request and the representation unfortunately fell on
deaf ears and the seized gold jewelleries are still in the illegal custody of the
respondents. It has also been submitted that the respondents are duty bound to
release the seized jewelleries to the petitioners as mandated by section 110(2) of the
Customs Act, 1962 and that non-release of the said gold jewelleries to the petitioners
amounts to abuse of power and jurisdiction conferred on the respondents under the
Act.
It has further been submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the refusal to release
the seized gold jewelleries as provided under section 110(2) of the Customs Act, 1962,
is per se illegal and unsustainable and WP( WP(C) No. 766 of 2023 Contd.../-

such act grossly violates the petitioners' Fundamental Right to Equality as
guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The learned counsel,
accordingly, submitted that appropriate direction be issued to the respondents to
return forthwith the seized gold jewelleries to the petitioners. [5] Mr.N. Brojendro,
learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted that as per the prevailing
office procedure, the Show Cause Notice (SCN) was drafted by the seizing unit, i.e.,
Divisional Preventive Unit, Imphal and the same was sent through e-office
electronically for approval by the competent authority at Customs (P), NER, Shillong.
In view of the monetary amount involved in the case, the SCN was required to be
signed by the Additional Commissioner of Customs sitting at Shillong and after
approval of the same, the SCN was signed by the Additional Commissioner on
17-08-2023. The approved and signed SCN was then sent through e-office to the
seizing unit at Customs Division, Imphal for DIN generation and issued of the SCN. It
has been also submitted that there were some technical glitches while generating DIN
due to limited internet connectivity and frequent disruptions and as such, DIN can be
generated only in the evening of 21-08-2023 at Imphal Customs Office and that
during the said period, the movement of files through e-office was not smooth as
well. It has further been submitted that due to the then prevailing crisis wherein
sporadic firings between the two warring communities that took place in Imphal city
and its periphery, the District Magistrate imposed strict curfew against movement of
the public and therefore, the SCN was registered only on 25-08-2023 through speed
post for delivery to the concerned noticees, hence there was no delay in issuance of
the SCN.

[6] It has been submitted on behalf of the respondents that if the
competent authority passed an order for confiscation/ penalty, etc., the aggrieved
party has an option to prefer an appeal to the appellate authority as provided under
section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962. Thereafter, another appellate forum is also
provided in the Appellate Tribunal under section 129 of the Act against the order
passed by the First Appellate Authority. It has also been submitted that as the
petitioners filed the present writ petition without resorting to the provisions of
section 128 and 129 of the Customs Act providing for filing a statutory appeal, the
present writ petition is not maintainable and is liable to be rejected.
[7] I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties at length and
considered their rival submissions. The only issue that arose for consideration in the
present writ petition is whether the Show Cause Notice was issued within the period
of time prescribed under section 110(2) of the Customs Act, 1962 and what will be the
consequence if the SCN was not issued within the limited period prescribed under the

aforesaid Act? [8] Section 110(1) of the Customs Act, 1962 empowers a proper officer
of the Customs to seize any goods if he has reason to believe that any such goods are
liable to confiscation under the Act. Under section 110(2) of the said Act, it is, inter
alia, provided that where any goods are seized under sub-section (1) and no notice in
respect thereof is given under clause (a) of section 124 within six months of the
seizure of the goods, the goods shall be returned to the person from whose possession
they were seized.
WP(
WP(C) No. 766 of 2023 Contd.../-
Section 124 provides, inter alia, that no order confiscating any goods or imposing any
penalty on any person shall be made unless the owner of the goods or such person -
(a) is given a notice in writing with the prior approval of the officer of Customs, not
below the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Customs informing him of the
grounds on which it is proposed to confiscate the goods or to impose a penalty.
Section 153 of the Act provides modes for service of notice. Under Section 153(1) of the Act, it is,
inter alia, provided that an order, decision, summons, notice or any other communication under the
Act or the rules made thereunder may be served in any of the following modes, namely -
(a) ***
(b) by a registered post or speed post or courier with acknowledgement due,
delivered to the person for whom it is issued or to his authorized representative, if
any, at his last known place of business or residence.
Section 153(2) provides that every order, decision, summons, notice or any communication shall be
deemed to have been served on the date on which it is tendered or published or a copy thereof is
affixed or uploaded in the manner provided under sub-section (1). [9] A conjoint reading of the
provisions of section 110, 124 and 153 of the Customs Act, 1962 makes it very clear that if any goods
are seized under section 110(1) of the Act, a notice as provided under section 124 of WP( WP(C) No.
766 of 2023 Contd.../-
the Act is required to be given to the owner of the goods before passing any order confiscating the
goods or imposing any penalty and section 110(2) mandates that such notice under section 124(a)
should be given within six months of the seizure and that on failure of giving such notice within the
prescribed period, the seized goods shall be returned to the person from whose possession they were
seized. Section 153 of the Act provides the mode of service of notice.

Muhammad Ali vs Union Of India on 23 July, 2024
[10] In the present case, it is an admitted fact that gold jewelleries were seized from the petitioners
on 23-02-2024 and the Show Cause Notice under section 124 of the Customs Act was dispatched
only on 25-08-2023 through speed post for delivery to the petitioners. If the period of six months as
provided under section 110(2) of the Act is to be reckoned from 23-02-2023, the period of six
months will lapsed on 22/23-08-2023. In view of the above, this court has no hesitation to hold that
the Show Cause Notice dated 17-08-2023 was not given within the period of six months prescribed
under section 110(2) of the Customs Act, 1962 and consequently, this court is of the considered view
that the retention of the seized gold jewelleries by the Customs officials is illegal as being violative of
the provisions of section 110(2) of the Customs Act. [11] So far as the objection raised by the learned
counsel appearing for the respondents regarding maintainability of the present writ petition on
ground of availability of filing a statutory appeal under the Act is concerned, since no order has been
passed by the authority for confiscating the seized gold jewelleries or imposing any penalty thereof,
there is no necessity or WP( WP(C) No. 766 of 2023 Contd.../-
requirement of filing any appeal. Accordingly, this court held that the objection raised by the
learned counsel appearing for the respondents is misconceived and not tenable.
In the result, the present writ petition is allowed by directing the respondents to release forthwith
the seized gold jewelleries to the concerned petitioners. With the aforesaid direction, the present
writ petition is disposed of without any order as to costs.
