... RESPONDENTS
BEFORE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.V. MURALIDARAN
For the Applicant :: Mr. S. Rajeetchandra, Adv.
For the Respondents :: Mr. H. Samarjit, Addl. PP
Mr. Dayali Elangbam, Adv.
.
Date of Hearing and reserving Judgment & Order :: 19.10.2023 Date of Judgment & Order ::
30.10.2023 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV) Heard Mr. S. Rajeetchandra, learned counsel for the
petitioner; Mr. H. Samarjit, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for respondent State and Mr.
Dayali Elangbam, the learned counsel for the private respondents.
2. This application has been filed by the learned counsel for the appellant under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
seeking permission to amend memo of appeal and allow it to be taken up as revision petition under
Section 401 Cr.P.C.
3. Mr. S. Rajeetchandra, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that, due to bona fide
mistake, he has presented the petition as an appeal under Section 372 Cr.P.C., whereas the same
should have been presented as revision MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of
2023) Page |3 petition under Section 401 Cr.P.C. Thus, the learned counsel prayed for following
amendments in the memo of appeal and allowing the criminal appeal to be taken up as a criminal
revision petition:
(1) At page no.1 of the main petition, in the heading IN THE MATTERS OF in the
first line after the word "Section 372" be replaced by "Section 401".
(2) In the First paragraph of the petition at page no.3, in the first line after the word
"present" the word "appellant" be replaced by petitioner.
(3) In the Second paragraph of the petition at page No.3 in the first line after the
word "this" the word "appeal" be replaced by "revision". (4) At page no.9, under the
Heading the "Grounds of appeal", after the word "for" the word "Appeal" be replaced
by "Revision".

(5) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 in the second line the word
"appeal" after the "/" sign be deleted.
(6) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 sub para no.1 MC(Cril.Appeal)
No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of 2023) Page |4 after the word "Criminal"
the word "Appeal" be replaced by "Revision".
(7) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 sub para no.3 after the word
"Criminal", the word "Appeal" be replaced by "Revision".
4. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the proposed amendments
shall not alter the pleadings of the appellant in any way. Thus, a prayer has been
made to permit him to amend the appeal as detailed above.
5. Opposing the prayer, Mr. Dayali Elangbam, the learned counsel for the private
respondents submitted that the application for amendment of the memo of appeal is
not maintainable in the present form and there is no such provision for amendment
of the criminal appeal. The learned counsel submitted that the appeal under Section
372 Cr.P.C cannot be converted under Section 401 Cr.P.C. for revision. The petitioner
can very well withdraw the appeal with leave of the Court to file revision, if he found
there is mistake. The pending memo of appeal cannot be amended as revision by
changing some words.
If the said amendments are allowed, then the whole nature of the case will change as the
amendment portion contented in the MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of
2023) Page |5 petition is neither clerical nor arithmetical mistake, but would lead to alteration of the
entire petition and the jurisdiction differs.
6. The learned counsel would submit that the appellant has presented the appeal as appeal against
acquittal under Code No.10251. Now the appellant is seeking amendment of the memo of appeal as
criminal revision which is separate entity with different Code No. and category of case etc. Only to
delay the case and to harass the private respondents, the present application has been filed. Since
the scope and object of the appeal and revision are quite different, the present application is not
maintainable and the same is liable to be dismissed.
7. Heard Mr. H. Samarjit, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent State on the
submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
8. This Court considered the rival submissions and also perused the materials available on record.
9. The present application has been filed by the learned conducting counsel for the appellant stating
that due to bona fide mistake he has presented the petition as an appeal under Section 372 Cr.P.C.
whereas the same should be presented as revision under Section 401 Cr.P.C.

MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of 2023) Page |6
10. The said prayer of the applicant has been vehemently opposed by the private respondents
contending that there is no such provision for amendment of the criminal appeal and that the
application for amendment of the memo of appeal is not maintainable. Further, the appeal under
Section 372 Cr.P.C. cannot be converted under Section 401 Cr.P.C. for revision. If the present
application is allowed, the nature of the case will change. At best, the present appeal can be
withdrawn with liberty to file a revision.
11. The proposed amendments sought by the applicant have been extracted supra. On a perusal of
the proposed amendments sought by the learned counsel, the same do not alter the nature of the
case as contended by the learned counsel for the private respondents. At the cost of repetition, the
proposed amendments are quoted hereunder:
(1) At page no.1 of the main petition, in the heading IN THE MATTERS OF in the
first line after the word "Section 372" be replaced by "Section 401".
(2) In the First paragraph of the petition at page no.3, in the first line after the word
"present" the word "appellant" be replaced by petitioner.
(3) In the Second paragraph of the petition at page No.3 in the first line after the
word "this" the word "appeal" be replaced by "revision".
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of 2023) Page |7 (4) At page no.9, under
the Heading the "Grounds of appeal", after the word "for" the word "Appeal" be replaced by
"Revision".
(5) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 in the second line the word "appeal" after the
"/" sign be deleted.
(6) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 sub para no.1 after the word "Criminal" the
word "Appeal" be replaced by "Revision".
(7) At page no.9 of the main petition under para no.14 sub para no.3 after the word "Criminal", the
word "Appeal" be replaced by "Revision".
12. Admittedly, the proposed amendments sought by the applicant are to change the words, namely
"appellant" as "petitioner"; "Section 372" as "Section 401" and "appeal" as "revision". The said
proposed amendments would in no way affect the nature of case. Though the change of
nomenclature of the criminal appeal as criminal revision is not sought for by the applicant, if the
proposed amendments are allowed and carried out, automatically, the Registry will change the
nomenclature of the case appropriately and the present case still cannot be treated as criminal
appeal as stated by the private respondents.

13. There is nothing in the Code of Criminal Procedure to bar a criminal appeal being treated as
criminal revision or vice- versa. The purpose of all rules of procedure obviously is to enable
MC(Cril.Appeal) No. 26 of 2023(Ref:- Cril. Appeal No. 10 of 2023) Page |8 justice to be done. As
such, every procedure which advances the dispensation of justice should be considered permissible,
unless it is prohibited. Even assuming that the Sessions Court does not have the power to treat the
revision as an appeal, the High Court has power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to direct to do so in order
to secure the ends of justice.
14. Therefore, finding bona fide in the prayer made in the present application, this Court is of the
view that the proposed amendment can be allowed. If the proposed amendments are allowed, no
prejudice would be caused to the private respondents, who are accused in Special Trial (POCSO)
Case No.12 of 2022 on the file of the Fast Track Special Court No.I, Manipur and who were
discharged from the charges under Sections 366/354/34 IPC and Section 10 of POCSO Act, 2012, as
there was no prima facie material for presuming that they have committed the offences levelled
against them.
15. In the result, MC (Cril. Appeal) No.26 of 2023 in Criminal Appeal No.10 of 2023 is allowed.
