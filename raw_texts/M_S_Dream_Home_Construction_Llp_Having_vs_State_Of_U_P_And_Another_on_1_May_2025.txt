M/S Dream Home Construction Llp Having ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
complainant and the court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court No.5, Agra proceeded to
summon the applicant on 24.04.2024 under Section 138 of N.I. Act being Complaint Case No. 3946
of 2024 (Jitendra Kumar Vs. M/s Dream Home Construction LLP and another).
9. Questioning the summoning order as well as the entire proceedings, the present application has
been preferred.
10. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the summoning order cannot be sustained
even for a single moment. Elaborating the said submissions, it is submitted that there is no legally
enforceable debt or liability so as to expose that the applicant would apply the provisions under
Section 138 of the N.I. Act, particularly, though cheque bearing No. 436086 stood drawn on
30.11.2023 for an amount of Rs.13,64,000/- but no conveyance or sale deed stood executed between
the parties. He submits that a totally incorrect false assertion has been made in the complaint that
the applicant purchased the said land as there is no reference either in the complaint or in the
summoning order about the details and the date of the agreement to sell/ sale deed. He also invited
attention of the court towards para 11 of the application wherein the following has been asserted:
"11. That the opposite party no.2 neither executed sale deed of his share in favour of the applicants
and M/s Anugya Hotels LLP inspite of repeated request nor handed over the possession of his share
in the aforesaid property to the applicants and M/s Anugya Hotels LLP while he had already
received Rs.22,50,000/-through earlier five cheques."
11. Learned counsel for the applicant has also seeks to rely upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of B. Krishna Reddy v. Syed Hafeez (died) and another; 2020 (17) SCC 488. It is,
thus, prayed that the entire proceedings and the summoning be quashed.
12. As noted earlier, there has been no representation on the part of the opposite party No. 2, despite
the fact that the service upon the opposite party No. 2.
13. Learned AGA has not disputed the fact that as per the allegations made in the complaint and the
documents available on record, no conveyance deed executed. According to him, the judgment in
the case of B. Krishna Reddy (supra) would apply in the facts and circumstances of the case.
14. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the records carefully.
15. Apparently, as per the allegations in the complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, the
applicant is stated to have purchased a house bearing No. 20/211, Jaipur House Ratanmuni Marg,
Loha Mandi, District Agra and the sale consideration was Rs.13,64,000/- through a cheque bearing
No. 436086 dated 30.11.2023 and as per the complaint, the said cheques stood dishonored on
presentation on account of the insufficiency of funds and statutory notice issued on 24.01.2024
which is stated to have been received on 25.01.2024. The contention of the learned counsel for the
applicant is that a totally incorrect averments have been made in the complaint that a conveyance
deed stood executed and the possession of the land in question was handed over to the applicant.
Reliance has been placed upon para 11 of the application so as to contend that the opposite party has

M/S Dream Home Construction Llp Having ... vs State Of U.P. And Another on 1 May, 2025
neither executed the sale deed in favour of the applicant nor handed over possession. The issue as to
whether the offence alleged to have been committed while dishonouring of cheque towards
consideration of the purchased of property wherein neither conveyance deed was executed nor the
possession whereof was delivered had been a subject matter of consideration by the Hon'ble Apex
Court in B. Krishna Reddy (supra) observed as under:
"The allegations in the complaint were that there was an oral sale of a property and
towards consideration for said purchase, the appellant had given the cheque for
Rs.4,00,000/-. However, the evidence on record discloses that no conveyance was
executed in favour of the appellant and, as such, the very basic ingredient was not
proved. In the circumstances, the Trial Court found that no case was established as
against the appellant and therefore the Trial Court vide its judgment and order dated
06.06.2008 acquitted the appellant of the charge levelled against him.
The matter was carried in appeal by the original complainant by filing Criminal
Appeal No.1086 of 2008 in the High Court. The view taken by the Trial Court was
upset by the High Court; the appeal was allowed; the appellant was found guilty of
the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and was
sentenced to suffer imprisonment till rising of the Court and was also directed to pay
a fine of Rs.4,25,000/-, out of which an amount of Rs.4,00,000/- was to be paid to
the complainant towards compensation and the remaining amount of Rs.25,000/-
was to be paid towards fine to the State.
While issuing notice on 18.11.2016, this Court stayed the operation of the impugned
judgment passed by the High Court.
In our view, the offence alleged was that a cheque was given towards consideration
for purchase of a property. Neither any document was produced on record nor there
was any evidence that any conveyance was executed in favour of the appellant. Thus,
the submission of the appellant that there was no existing debt or liability against
which the cheque was given had to be accepted. In our view, the High Court was in
error in accepting the appeal and upsetting the view taken by the Trial Court.
We, therefore, allow this appeal, set-aside the decision of the High Court and restore
the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court. The appeal stands
allowed in aforesaid terms."
16. Since this much has been only alleged that the applicant has purchased the house but it is the
specific case of the applicant that neither sale deed nor the possession of the land was handed over
and the same fact has not been controverted, probably for the reason that the opposite party No. 2
has not put in appearance, despite service. Thus, respectively following the judgment in the case of
B. Krishna Reddy (surpa), the application is allowed.

No.3946 of 2024 (Jitendra Kumar Vs. M/s Dream Home Construction LLP and another) is set
aside.
18. Passing of the order would not preclude the complainant to take any other remedy as available
under law.
