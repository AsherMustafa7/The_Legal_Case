It is further stated that delay of 35 days has been caused due
to the reasons explained above and the same is unintentional and
bonafide and in the interest of justice, it is prayed that the same may be
condoned.
[2] The respondents, except respondent No. 29, have filed their
counter affidavit to the application. It is stated that there is gross negligence
and inactions on the part of the applicants in preparing the accompanying
writ appeal. Further it is also stated that there is no administrative approval
to file the appeal from the Administrative Department, which is the
Education Department but the administrative approval is given by the
Deputy Secretary (Law), Government of Manipur vide order dated
17.03.2022. It is prayed that the application for condonation of 35 days
delay be rejected. The accompanying appeal has been filed without
administrative approval and the same is defective. Further, the Law
Department's order dated 17.03.2022 is not annexed in the application
under objection and as such, the respondents are not able to given proper
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129810030/ 10

Page 13
objection to the application. There is no explanation for the period from
24.02.2022 to 15.03.2022. It is prayed that the application may be rejected
as being devoid of merit.
[3] The State applicants have filed additional affidavit. It is stated
that under Article 166 of the Constitution, the State Government has
framed Rules of Business which comes into force w.e.f. 21.01.1972. Under
Rule 39 of the Rules of Business of Government of Manipur, 1972 is so
clear that All Administrative Departments shall consult the Law Department
on the institution or withdrawal of any prosecution at the instance of the
Administrative Department and the defence or institution of any suit or
proceedings filed against or by the Government. As per the Business of
Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules, 2009 it is stated that the Law
Department is the competent authority. The respondents have also filed
reply to the additional affidavit of the state applicants. It is stated that as per
Rule 20 of the Business of Government of Manipur (Allocation) Rules,
2009, the role of the Law Department with the matter of giving advice on all
legal matters and all matters relating to supervision of Government
litigations but administrative approval ought to be given by the concerned
department, i.e., Education Department.
[4] Heard Mr. Th. Vashum, learned G.A. for the applicant and Mr.
T. Rajendra, learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Donald, learned
counsel for the respondents.
Page 14
[5] Mr. Th. Vashum, learned G.A. for the applicant, submits that
in paras 2 & 3 of the application, the day to day delay has been explained
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129810030/ 11
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 3 April, 2023
and there is no inordinate delay on the part of the state applicant in
preferring the accompanying writ appeal against the impugned order. He
also submits that while considering the explanation of delay, the Court
ought to have given liberal view while considering the application filed by
the State agency as the matter has to pass through many stages/officials
while taking approval. He points out that the objection of filing the appeal
without administrative approval can be considered at the time of the
admission of the appeal and it is not a matter relevant in consideration for
application for condonation of delay. A short delay of 35 days may be
condoned.
[6] Mr. T. Rajendra, learned senior counsel for the respondents,
submits that the explanations given in para 2 do not give proper reason
and there is inordinate delay with respect to serial 15 regarding date, i.e.,
23.03.2022 and there is no proper explanation for the delay between
15.03.2022 to 23.03.2022. Moreover, the appeal has been filed without the
administrative approval from the concerned department. The administrative
approval given by the Law Department cannot be considered as an
administrative approval. He prays that the application may be dismissed
without devoid of merit.
Page 15
[7] In the case of Balwant Singh v. Jagdish Singh, (2010) 8
SCC 685, Hon'ble Supreme Court discussed the concept of 'sufficient cause'
for condoning delay and held as below:
"25. We may state that even if the term "sufficient cause"
has to receive liberal construction, it must squarely fall
within the concept of reasonable time and proper conduct of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129810030/ 12
The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 3 April, 2023
the party concerned. The purpose of introducing liberal
construction normally is to introduce the concept of
"reasonableness" as it is understood in its general
connotation.
26. The law of limitation is a substantive law and has
definite consequences on the right and obligation of a party
to arise. These principles should be adhered to and applied
appropriately depending on the facts and circumstances of
a given case. Once a valuable right has accrued in favour
of one party as a result of the failure of the other party to
explain the delay by showing sufficient cause and its own
conduct, it will be unreasonable to take away that right on
the mere asking of the applicant, particularly when the
delay is directly a result of negligence, default or inaction of
that party. Justice must be done to both parties equally.
Then alone the ends of justice can be achieved. If a party
has been thoroughly negligent in implementing its rights
and remedies, it will be equally unfair to deprive the other
party of a valuable right that has accrued to it in law as a
result of his acting vigilantly.
27. The application filed by the applicants lacks in details.
Even the averments made are not correct and ex facie lack

bona fide. The explanation has to be reasonable or
plausible, so as to persuade the Court to believe that the
explanation rendered is not only true, but is worthy of
exercising judicial discretion in favour of the applicant. If it
does not specify any of the enunciated ingredients of
judicial pronouncements, then the application should be
dismissed. On the other hand, if the application is bona fide
and based upon true and plausible explanations, as well as
reflects normal behaviour of a common prudent person on
the part of the applicant, the Court would normally tilt the
judicial discretion in favour of such an applicant. Liberal
construction cannot be equated with doing injustice to the
other party."
[8] In the case of Postal General v. Living Media Limited :
(2012) 3 SCC 563, while dismissing the appeal by government with a delay
of 427 days of delay on the point of non-explanation of the delay so
caused, Hon'ble Supreme Court held as below:

The State Of Manipur vs Shri Oinam Manisana Singh on 3 April, 2023
"28. Though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of
condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence
or deliberate inaction or lack of bona fides, a liberal
concession has to be adopted to advance substantial
justice, we are of the view that in the facts and
circumstances, the Department cannot take advantage of
various earlier decisions. The claim on account of
impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic
methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted
in view of the modern technologies being used and
available. The law of limitation undoubtedly binds
everybody, including the Government.

30. Considering the fact that there was no proper explanation offered by the Department for the
delay except mentioning of various dates, according to us, the Department has miserably failed to
give any acceptable and cogent reasons sufficient to condone such a huge delay. Accordingly, the
appeals are liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay."
[9] In the present case, the State applicants have given a comprehensive chart giving day to day
movement of the file and is able to explain. Accordingly, the delay of 35 days have been caused in
moving file from one table to another and from one office to another. There is no inordinate and
un-explained delay as in the cases cited above. The objection of the respondents to the
maintainability of the appeal is to be considered at the time of the admission of the main appeal and
not in the present application. In an application for condonation of delay, the Court has to examine
the explanation for 'sufficient cause' for not filing the appeal within the stipulated time.
[10] We are of the view that the State applicants have been able to explain the delay. Accordingly,
the delay of 35 days in filing the accompanying writ appeal is condoned and the present application
is allowed. However, it is clarified that the respondents are at liberty to raise the question of
maintainability of the writ appeal on the plea of filing without Page 18 proper administrative
approval and this Court do not express any opinion on this issue at this stage. Accordingly, the
application for condonation of delay is disposed of. No cost.
[11] Registry is directed to register the writ appeal, if the same is in order.
