COMMON JUDGMENT
S.VAIDYANATHAN, J.
and DR.G.JAYACHANDRAN, J.
The Party-in-person appeared before this Court filing these Habeas Corpus Petitions to declare the
orders issued by the Government pertaining to Corona epidemic restriction as unconstitutional, null
and void against Article 21 of the Constitution of India and also seek monetary compensation of
Rs.5,00,000/-(Rupees Five lakhs only) since the lock-down has not only crippled his fundamental
right but also https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD)Nos.SR15120 and 15176 of 2021 crippled
his income. Since the Registry has rightly found that these petitions are not maintainable, returned
it thrice, however, the petitioner- in-person not being convinced, quoting all the judgments of the
Courts pertaining to Habeas Corpus Petition, has insisted for hearing and thus, he is before us
today.
2. Before adverting to the content of his affidavit, this Court wanted to ensure whether the petitioner
herein had really come to this Court with any public interest or he is a busybody have no other work
but to waste the Court time. Hence, the petitioner-in-person was enquired about his back ground.
He replied that he is a diploma holder discontinued B.E. Course, now aged about 63 years. He also
claims though he was employed in Electricity Board for two years, later resigned. He is not ready to
disclose, why he resigned and when he resigned, He further claims that he is doing contract work for

Electricity Board, but he is not a registered contractor.
3. With these background, he claims that the Covid-19 virus and its variants are not deadly disease,
but curable in ordinary course, if the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD)Nos.SR15120
and 15176 of 2021 health department is vigilant and gives proper health care to the public. Instead of
doing as he suggest, the Government has passed impugned orders violating the Fundamental Rights
enshrined under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, therefore, same to be declared
unconstitutional.
4. When this Court posed a question whether he is conversant with the Disaster Management Act,
2005, its scope and ambit, the petitioner-in- person answered in affirmative. This Court, after being
satisfied that, he is a busybody come to this Court only for the sake of publicity warned him that he
cannot waste the Court time by filing such frivolous petitions. Despite that, repeatedly he made the
same submission, which is oppose to common sense. Mocking the sincere efforts taken by the State
to curb the pandemic, he was condemning the preventive measures taken by the State Government
and Central Government to curtail the spread of Pandemic.
5. This Court firmly believes that the attitude of persons like the petitioner herein is detrimental to
the selfless service rendered by the Doctors, health workers and other Covid warriors, who have lost
their lives while treating Covid patients. Unless busybody like the petitioners
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD)Nos.SR15120 and 15176 of 2021 herein are punished
for their senseless activity, approaching the Court with frivolous petitions, this Court fears that the
sacrifice of the selfless people will go in vain.
6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Dr.B.Singh vs. Union of India, reported in AIR 2004 SC
1923 heavily condemned the practice of filing a Public Interest Litigation for a cheap popularity. The
said judgment has been followed by a Division Bench of this Court, comprising one of us (SVNJ) in
K.R.Ramaswamy vs. Secretary, reported in MANU/TN/2118/2014, which has been upheld by the
Supreme Court on 05.12.2014. The relevant paragraph of the judgment of the Supreme Court,
reported in AIR 2004 SC 1923 (supra) is extracted hereunder:
“12. Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great care and
circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the
beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or
publicity seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the armory
of law for delivering social justice to the citizens. The attractive brand name of public
interest litigation should not be allowed to be used for suspicious products of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD)Nos.SR15120 and 15176 of 2021
mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and
not publicity oriented or founded on personal vendetta. As indicated above, Court
must be careful to see that a body of persons or member of public, who approaches
the court is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or political
motivation or other oblique consideration. The Court must not allow its process to be
abused for oblique considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at times from

behind. Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with
judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives and try to bargain
for a good deal as well to enrich themselves. Often they are actuated by a desire to
win notoriety or cheap popularity. The petitions of such busy bodies deserve to be
thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with exemplary
costs.”
7. Under the guise of PIL, these Habeas Corpus Petitions have been filed. Hence, both these Habeas
Corpus Petitions are dismissed as not maintainable. Further, cost of Rs.1,50,000/-(Rupees One lakh
and fifty thousand only) imposed on the petitioner-in-person to be paid within fifteen days from
today, to the credit of Covid-19 Ward at Government Rajaji Medical College Hospital, Madurai. If
the petitioner fails to pay the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis H.C.P.(MD)Nos.SR15120 and 15176
of 2021 cost within the given time, the District Collector of Madurai is authorised to recover the
same under the Revenue Recovery Act, 1890.
