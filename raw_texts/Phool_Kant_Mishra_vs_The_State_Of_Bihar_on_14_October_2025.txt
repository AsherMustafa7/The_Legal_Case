Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
2/21
Bihar, the college in question is a government aided Sanskrit
institution receiving financial assistance from the Rashtriya
Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi. The informant has alleged
that government funds received by the college are deposited
in joint Account No. 2284 maintained with the Central Bank
of India, Jhanjharpur Branch, Madhubani, Bihar. On
15.06.2009
a sum of Rs. 6,75,000/- was withdrawn from the said joint account by the then Principal- Phool
Kant Mishra i.e. the petitioner and on the same day an equivalent amount was deposited in the
Account No. 6845 of the same bank. The said account stands in the name of Principal (Kalyan Kosh)
J.N.B. Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya but is alleged to be an unauthorized personal account of the
petitioner opened for depositing misappropriated funds of the college. It has further been alleged
that the aforesaid account has never been audited or reported to the Managing Committee and that
the Principal has no authority to open any independent bank account in terms of the bye-laws of the
college. The informant has also alleged that the first joint Account No. 2284 though audited was
being illegally operated by unauthorized signatories. One Dr. Vidyeshwar Jha, who was relieved
from service on 05.03.2009 is stated Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
to have signed a cheque on 31.03.2009 and another Jwalanand Mishra, Junior Lecturer in Hindi
was shown as senior most Lecturer and made a second signatory by the Principal thereby enabling
illegal operation of the said account. The amount of Rs. 6,75,000/- which was government money
sent for salary and scholarship for the financial year 2008-09 was siphoned off to the said
unauthorized account and withdrawn in phases during 2009, 2010 and 2011 thereby rendering the
audit report false and fabricated. The informant has claimed that Dr. Bidyeshwar Jha admitted in
writing that his signature had been obtained by the Principal beforehand and were subsequently
misused.
3. The petitioner has further alleged to have refused to furnish any explanation to the Chairman of
the Trust and declined to respond to the queries raised under the RTI Act, 2005. The informant has
stated that he has documentary evidence regarding misappropriation / embezzlement of Rs.
6,75,000/- but newspaper reports and the Chairman's communication suggest that the total
embezzlement amount was Rs.11,70,000/-. It is further stated that the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan
had earlier conducted inquiries in 2006 and 2007 into the misconduct of the petitioner and found
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 even his appointment to be illegal on
the ground of inadequate and forged qualification. The informant claims to have been duly

Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
authorized by the parent body, J.N.B. Trust, to pursue legal action concerning the Trust. It is based
on the aforesaid written report the F.I.R. bearing Sakatpur P.S. Case No. 115 of 2011 dated
28.11.2011 came to be registered against the petitioner and two other co-accused.
4. The F.I.R. was investigated upon and a charge sheet no. 51 of 2014 dated 28.09.2014 under
Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 409 and 120-B of the I.P.C. was filed against two accused persons,
namely Phool Kant Mishra i.e. petitioner and Dhirendra Jha.
5. The police, however, submitted closure report with respect to Dr. Bidyeshwar Jha and Jwalanand
Mishra showing them as not charge sheeted. Thereafter, on perusal of the materials in the case diary
and charge sheet, the learned Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Darbhanga by order dated
16.04.2015 took cognizance of the aforesaid offences against the two charge sheeted accused persons
and directed for further proceeding of the case. The further proceeding of the present case arising
out of Sakatpur P.S. Case No. 115 / 2011 pending in the court of Sub Divisional Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 Judicial Magistrate, Darbhanga was stayed by this
Court vide order dated 07.08.2019.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that from bare perusal of the written report it would
appear that the informant has made misleading statements with respect to the functioning of the
college, the operation of bank accounts and even regarding his own capacity namely the alleged
entrustment of authority by the Trust to take care of its legal and other issues. It is urged that the
present F.I.R. has been lodged by the informant in order to wreak personal vengeance against the
petitioner. Relying upon Annexure- 3 learned counsel submits that from perusal of the letter dated
29.04.2008 it would appear that the informant namely Binay Jha alias Binay Kumar Jha had
himself addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Trust tendering his resignation from the
membership of the Trust as well as its affiliated organizations and institutions. It is further pointed
out that by subsequent letter dated 10.05.2008 the Chairman of the Trust duly certified that the said
informant was no longer associated with the Trust or any of its institutions or organizations. This
according to the petitioner clearly shows that the informant had ceased to be an authorized member
of Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 the Trust as early as in the year
2008 whereas the present F.I.R. came to be lodged only in the year 2011. The petitioner has further
relied upon Annexure-5 which is a letter dated 22.01.2009 issued by the Chairman of the Managing
Committee of the Trust addressed to the Deputy Registrar (Finance), Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan,
New Delhi. In the said communication it was categorically stated that the allegations made against
the petitioner was completely unfounded and that the informant namely Binay Jha @ Binay Kumar
Jha had no locus.
7. Learned counsel further submits that insofar as the allegation of embezzlement of fund by
opening Account No. 6845 is concerned, the same cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed as
secret or personal account of the petitioner. It is pointed out that the account in question was
opened with the Central Bank of India in the name of "Principal (Kalyan Kosh), J.N.B. Adarsh
Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Lagma, Darbhanga" in the year 1990 and the petitioner joined as Principal
in the year 1996 as such, it was not opened during the tenure of the petitioner as Principal and the
same is an institutional account to be operated by whoever holds the office of the Principal of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 3
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 said college. Therefore, the allegation
that the said account was a private account of the petitioner is wholly incorrect. The Branch
Manager of the Central Bank of India has by certificate dated 22.12.2011 (Annexure-6) categorically
certified that Account No. 6845 had been opened in the year 1990.
8. Countering the allegations in the F.I.R. regarding non
-audit of the college accounts, learned counsel submits that the said allegation is wholly false and
misleading. In this regard reliance has been placed upon Annexure - 7 which contains both the
auditor's report as well as utilization certificate. It is pointed out that in the auditor's report, it has
been categorically recorded that the accounts of the college were duly audited for the year ending
31.03.2009 and the books of account and other relevant papers produced for verification were in
agreement with the financial statements of the institution. Further from the utilization certificate it
clearly emerges that the conditions on which grant-in-aid was sanctioned had been duly fulfilled and
that the funds received had in fact been utilized for the very purpose for which they were sanctioned.
He further argued that no doubt it is an admitted fact that the college in question maintains Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 two separate bank accounts. One of these
accounts namely Account No. 2284 is meant for the deposit of government grants and other official
finances. The other account i.e. Account No. 6845 stands in the name of the Principal of the College
and mainly comprises donations and income received from other sources.
9. It has been submitted that it has been the long standing practice of the college that expenses of
the institution /college are met from both accounts which includes disbursement of salary to
teaching and non teaching staff as well as other day -to- day management expenses. Even as per the
allegation in the F.I.R. the sum of Rs. 6,75,000/- was stated to be government money remitted for
payment of salary and scholarship for the financial year 2008-2009, however, in reality the said
amount was not earmarked for salary but for other purposes such as scholarship and allied
expenditures. It is further submitted that perusal of statement of Account No. 6845 would reveal
that a substantial portion of the fund still remains unutilized inasmuch an amount of Rs. 3,43,479/-
continues to be available in the said account.
10. Learned counsel further submits that the learned Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016
dt.14-10-2025 court of S.D.J.M., Darbhanga without applying its judicial mind has taken cognizance
against the petitioner in a mechancial and casual manner without considering the absence of
foundational material to constitute the alleged offence. It is urged that such an order of cognizance
passed in a perfunctory manner cannot sustain in the eye of law and is therefore liable to be
quashed. In support of his submissions he relied upon the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of State of Haryana versus Bhajan Lal & Ors reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 and
Anand Kumar Mohatta versus State (NCT of Delhi) reported in (2019) 11 SCC 706.
11. I have heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and have also perused material on
record. As far as the appearance on behalf of the opposite party no. 2 / informant is concerned,
despite valid service of notice no one has appeared.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 4
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
12. The only question that falls for consideration is whether the order taking cognizance dated
16.04.2015 is legally sustainable. As per plain reading of the F.I.R. the main allegation levelled
against the petitioner is that being the Principal of the college he misappropriated Rs. Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 6,75,000/- by transferring it from the official
joint account to an allegedly illegal personal account of the Principal and thereafter withdrew the
amount for his own use by manipulating audit reports and signatures to conceal the act.
13. It is specific case of the petitioner supported by relevant document that account in the name of
the Principal was opened in 1990 and the petitioner took charge as Principal in the year 1996. The
amount was allegedly deposited in the Principal account in the year 2009 and the audit of both the
accounts were conducted for the year ending 31.03.2009. The auditor has found books of account
and other relevant papers produced for verification were in agreement with the financial statements
of the institution.
14. The petitioner has also annexed the statement of account of both the accounts and from the
statement of account of the concerned Account No. 6845 it appears that said account was debited in
the name of various persons may be teaching or non -teaching staff of the college as on 30.03.2010
Rs. 3,43,479/- was still available in the account as unutilized amount. The petitioner has claimed
that the present F.I.R. has been lodged in order to wreak vengeance against the petitioner due to
some dispute in the Trust. The Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
informant resigned from the Trust claiming mismanagement and deviating from the objectives of
the Trust which was accepted by the Chairman of the Trust. It is only thereafter in order to disturb
the functioning of the institutions and organizations run by the Trust the present F.I.R. has been
lodged.
15. After investigation the police submitted charge sheet on 28.09.2014 against the petitioner and
one Dhirendra Jha under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 409 and 120B I.P.C. The learned Magistrate
has taken cognizance by the impugned order dated 16.04.2015 recording in its order that on perusal
of the F.I.R., case diary and charge sheet and considering material available in the case diary a
prima facie case is made out for the aforesaid offences against the accused.
16. I have gone through the case diary also. From the entire investigation report it does not appear
that police has found any material to connect the petitioner with the offences for which the
petitioner has been charged. The investigation done by the police is vague and perfunctory. For
constituting an offence under Section 467 & 468 of the I.P.C. condition precedent is making a false
document. In this regard paragraph nos. 13 & 14 of the judgment reported Patna High Court CR.
MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 in (2009) 8 SCC 751 Mohammed Ibrahim & Ors. versus The
State of Bihar & Anr. is relevant, which are reproduced here for ready reference:-
"13. The condition precedent for an offence under Sections 467 and 471 is forgery.
The condition precedent for forgery is making a false document (or false electronic
record or part thereof). This case does not relate to any false electronic record.
Therefore, the question is whether the first accused, in executing and registering the
two sale deeds purporting to sell a property (even if it is assumed that it did not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 5
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
belong to him), can be said to have made and executed false documents, in collusion
with the other accused.
14. An analysis of Section 464 of the Penal Code shows that it divides false documents
into three categories:
1. The first is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently makes or executes a
document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was
made or executed by some other person, or by the authority of some other person, by
whom or by whose authority he knows it was not made or executed.
2. The second is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or
otherwise, alters a document in any material part, without lawful authority, after it
has been made or executed by either himself or any other person.
3. The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign,
execute or alter Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 a
document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a) unsoundness of mind;
or (b) intoxication;
or (c) deception practised upon him, know the contents of the document or the nature of the
alteration.
In short, a person is said to have made a "false document", if (i) he made or executed a document
claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else; or (ii) he altered or tampered a
document; or (iii) he obtained a document by practising deception, or from a person not in control
of his senses."
17. In Nitin Ahluwalia versus State of Punjab & Anr. reported in 2025 INSC 1128 the Hon'ble
Supreme Court has held that it is true that elaborate defences and evidence brought on record is not
to be considered at this stage, it is equally true that a mechanical approach cannot be countenanced.
What renders a judicial mind distinct is its application to the given facts in accordance with law.
Therefore, the Court ought to have appreciated, at least to some extent, the background in which the
respondent filed the subject FIR.
18. In another decision of Salib @ Shalu @ Salim vs State of UP reported in 2023 INSC 687 the
Supreme Court has held that whenever an accused comes before the Court invoking either the
inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or extraordinary jurisdiction
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 under Article 226 of the Constitution
to get the FIR or the criminal proceedings quahsed essentially on the ground that such proceedings
are manifestly frivolous or vexatious or instituted with the ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance,
then in such circumstances the Court owes a duty to look into the FIR with care and a little more
closely. We say so because once the complainant decides to proceed against the accused with an
ulterior motive for wreaking personal vengeance, etc., then he would ensure that the FIR /
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 6
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
complaint is very well drafted with all the necessary pleadings. The complainant would ensure that
the averments made in the FIR / complaint are such that they disclose the necessary ingredients to
constitute the alleged offence. Therefore, it will not be just enough for the Court to look into the
averments made in the FIR / complaint alone for the purpose of ascertaining whether the necessary
ingredients to constitute the alleged offence are disclosed or not. In frivolous or vexatious
proceedings, the Court owes a duty to look into many other attending circumstances emerging from
the record of the case over and above the averments and, if need be, with due care and
circumspection try to read in between the lines.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025
19. In this backdrop the analytical framework laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pradeep
Kumar Kesarwani v. State of U.P. reported in 2025 Live Law (SC) 880 becomes relevant. The court
in that case delineated four steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashing under Section
482 Cr.P.C.
(i) Step one, whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable
i.e. the materials is of sterling and impeccable quality?
(ii) Step two, whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the assertions
contained in the charges levelled against the accused, i.e. the material is sufficient to reject and
overule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e. the material is such, as would persuade
a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false.
(iii) Step three, whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been refuted by the
prosecution / complainant; and / or the material is such , that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the
prosecution / complainant?
(iv) Step four, whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and
would not Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 serve the ends of justice?
20. If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, judicial conscience of the High Court should
persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings, in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482
of the Cr.P.C. Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court
time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as, proceedings arising
therefrom) specially when, it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the
accused.
21. In the present case the F.I.R. though detailed and meticulously drafted runs into 69 pages with
12 annexures containing a detailed written complaint, reference to college bye-laws and even the
allegation touching upon the petitioner's appointment, qualification and administrative decisions,
the F.I.R. reads more like a departmental charge- sheet than a criminal complaint drafted with
precision. A close reading reveals that the informant who has resigned from the membership of the
Trust in 2008 lodged the F.I.R. only in 2011 alleging the incident said to have occurred in the year
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 7
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
2008-09. The delay of more than two year without any plausible explanation casts a deep shadow
on the bona Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 fide of the complaint.
22. When these facts are considered it becomes evident that the F.I.R., however well drafted, is a
product of personal vendetta and ulterior motive.
23. The petitioner relies upon the following materials-
(a) the bank certificate dated 22.12.2011 (Annexure-6) stating Account No. 6845 was opened in 1990
in the name "Principal (Kalyan Kosh) J.N.B. Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya"; (b) the Auditor's
Report and Utilization Certificate for FY 2008-09 (Annexure-7) confirming accounts were audited
and grant conditions were complied with; (c) the statement of Account No. 6845 showing a balance
of Rs. 3,43,479/-; and (d) official communications certifying the informant's resignation and the
Chairman's earlier rejection of the allegations (Annexure- 3).
24. The bank's certification dated 22.12.2011 conclusively records that Account No. 6845, described
as "Principal (Kalyan Kosh), J.N.B. Adarsh Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Lagma, Darbhanga," was
opened in 1990, long before the petitioner assumed office in 1996. This prima facie shows that this is
not petitioner's secret personal account for siphoning funds. The auditor's report and Patna High
Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 utilization certificate for the year ending
31.03.2009 further record that the accounts were duly audited and the grant-in- aid utilized for its
sanctioned purposes. The account statement itself shows that a substantial balance amount of Rs.
3,43,479/- remains in the account, which is wholly inconsistent with any claim of misappropriation
or embezzlement.
25. Secondly, whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the assertions
contained in the charges levelled against the accused, i.e., the material is sufficient to reject and
overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint, i.e., the material is such, as would
persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false.
26. The main allegation against that the petitioner is that he opened or used an unauthorised
personal account (A/c No. 6845) to siphon Rs. 6,75,000/- from joint account (A/c No. 2284).
27. Upon perusal of the case diary, this Court finds no evidence which, even if taken at its face value,
would establish the essential ingredients of the offences alleged. There is no material indicating that
the petitioner converted Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 government
funds for personal use; there is no evidence of falsification or forgery of any document; there is no
proof of deceit or fraudulent inducement. The entire allegation rests upon the transfer of Rs.
6,75,000/- from one college account to another which, by itself, is incapable of constituting a
criminal offence in the absence of mens rea or personal gain.
28. Thirdly, whether the material relied upon by the accused, has not been refuted by the
prosecution/complainant; and/or the material is such, that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the
prosecution/complainant?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21594798/ 8
Phool Kant Mishra vs The State Of Bihar on 14 October, 2025
29. The prosecution has not refuted aforesaid documents nor produced any material capable of
justifiably contradicting them.
30. Fourthly, whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and
would not serve the ends of justice?
31. The charge-sheet is bereft of foundational evidence, and the documents placed on record by the
petitioner are unimpeachable. The continuation of prosecution on such a hollow record would only
result in needless harassment and misuse of judicial time. The attending circumstances of this Patna
High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of 2016 dt.14-10-2025 case, the informant's lack of locus, his
resignation in 2008, the delay of more than two years in lodging the FIR, and the absence of any
proof of personal gain or criminal intent clearly suggest that the FIR was motivated by personal
animosity and designed to wreak personal vengeance under the garb of criminal prosecution.
32. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a judgment reported in (2015) 12 SCC 420 Mehmood Ul Rehman
versus Khazir Mohammad Tunda and Others has held that no formal or speaking or reasoned orders
are required at the stage of Section 190 / 204 Cr.P.C., there must be sufficient indication on the
application of mind by the Magistrate to the facts constituting commission of an offence. The failure
to assign brief reason renders the order vulnerable.
33. In the backdrop of the discussion held hereinabove on law and upon facts, in the opinion of this
Court, permitting the prosecution to continue against the petitioner shall amount to abuse of the
process of criminal court. Accordingly, in order to prevent the abuse of the process of court and
secure the ends of justice, I deem it fit to quash the order of cognizance qua the petitioner.
34. In the result, the order dated 16.04.2015 passed by Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.23596 of
2016 dt.14-10-2025 learned S.D.J.M., Darbhanga in Sakatpur P.S. Case No. 115 of 2011 (GR No.
4030 of 2011) is hereby quashed.
35. This application is allowed.
