Dharmendra vs State Of U.P. And 3 Others on 1 April, 2025
5. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has
been falsely implicated in the present case with a view to cause unnecessary harassment and to
victimize him. It is stated that he has nothing to do with the said offence. It is stated that FIR is
delayed by about four days and there is no explanation of the said delay caused.
6. Learned counsel has further stated that the victim is the consenting party, as is evident from her
statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C., whereby she had gone with the applicant to Panipat, Haryana
and remained with him for several days and she had expressed her willingness to marry him. There
is no medical corroboration of the incident.
7. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of
the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false
implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal history of
the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 7.6.2024. In case, the applicant is released on
bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
8. Learned State Law Officer and learned counsel for the informant have vehemently opposed the
bail application on the ground that the victim is minor, aged about 16 years only as per School
certificate, as such, the consent of the victim has no value in the eyes of law. However, they have not
disputed the fact that there is no criminal history of the applicant.
9. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs.
Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785 this Court has avoided detailed
examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party
should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is
needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
10. The well-known principle of "Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty," gives rise to the
concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.
11. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be
taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is
established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life
or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the
procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme
Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors., 2022 INSC 690.
12. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of
Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasized that the very well-settled principle of law that
bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts
should recognize the principle that ?bail is a rule and jail is an exception?.
13. Learned State Law Officer could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would
warrant denial of bail to the applicant.

14. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the
trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or
thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or
intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned State Law Officer.
15. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for
the parties, the evidence on record, the victim being the consenting party, as per her statement
recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C., coupled by the fact that the FIR is delayed by about four days, without
expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has
made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.
16. Let the applicant- Dharmendra involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on
bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
court concerned subject to following conditions.
(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates
fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement
under Section 313 Cr.P.C./351 B.N.S.S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of
the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the
Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in
accordance with law.
17. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned
before the bonds are accepted.
18. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way
affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the
witnesses.
