JUDGMENT
The defendants 1, 3 and 4 in O.S.No.1 of 2006 on the file of the learned District Munsif,
Kallakurichi, are the appellants. The suit was laid by the plaintiff/1st respondent herein contending
that she purchased a suit property from the father of the 3rd defendant namely Perumalsamy under
a Sale Deed, dated 05.09.2005. Claiming that the defendants attempted to interfere with her
possession, the plaintiff sought for declaration of her title and injunction.
2. The suit was resisted by the defendants contending that the suit property was a joint family
property belonging to the 3rd defendant and his father Perumalsamy and at a partition that took
place some time during the year 1990, the suit property was allotted to the 3rd defendant. It is
claimed that the defendants 1 and 2 purchased the property from the 3rd defendant under two sale
deeds, dated 26.09.2005. Though it was claimed that the suit property was assigned by the
Government to Perumalsamy in the year 1965, the plaintiff did not produce the deed of assignment
or an order of assignment before the trial Court. The vendor of the plaintiff Perumalsamy
http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.No.1224 of 2019 and was examined as P.W.2.
3. Considering the evidence on record, the trial Court concluded that PW2 Perumalsamy and the 3rd
defendant had jointly sold certain properties and therefore the properties are ancestral properties.
On the said conclusion, the trial Court dismissed the suit. Aggrieved, the plaintiff preferred an
appeal in A.S.No.16 of 2009.
4. Pending appeal, the plaintiff filed applications in I.A.No.10 of 2019 and I.A.No.251 of 2016,
seeking to produce additional documents. Both the applications were allowed by the lower appellate
Court and the documents were marked as Exs.A5 to A7. Ex.A7 is the order of assignment, dated
30.09.1965 in the name of Perumalsamy.
5. Considering the additional evidence produced, the lower appellate Court concluded that the suit
property having been assigned by the Government to Perumalsamy, cannot be considered as a
property of the joint family. Therefore, once Perumalsamy had alienated the property on
05.09.2005, the alienation by the son of Perumalsamy namely the 3rd defendant cannot confer any
right over the right on the defendants 1and 2. On the said conclusion, the lower appellate Court
allowed the appeal and http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.No.1224 of 2019 and the decreed the suit as
prayed for. Aggrieved, the defendants 1, 3 and 4 have come up with this second appeal.
6. Notice of motion was ordered on 11.12.2019. Mr.S.Soundhar has entered appearance for
respondents.
7. I have heard Mr.T.Saikrishnan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants and Mr.S.Soundhar,
learned counsel appearing for respondents.

8. Mr.T.Saikrishnan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants would vehemently contend that
the lower appellate Court was not right in receiving the documents as additional evidence without
affording an opportunity to the parties to lead evidence on the documents. He would also contend
that the trial Court had found that the properties were treated as joint family properties in as much
as the 3rd defendant had also joined execution of sale deed with the 1st defendant in respect of other
properties that were assigned to his father Perumalsamy.
9. I an unable to countenance both the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellants. No
doubt true, when documents are sought to be admitted as additional evidence in the appeal, the
appellate Court has to http://www.judis.nic.in S.A.No.1224 of 2019 and give an opportunity to the
parties to lead evidence on those documents. However, when there is no dispute regarding the
nature of the documents and the documents are public documents, as in this case, an order of
assignment made by the Government, A Register and Adangal extract, I do not think the appellate
Court can be faulted for receiving the documents without oral evidence. It is not the case of the
defendants that Perumalsamy got the properties through some other source of title, apart from
Ex.A7 namely the order of assignment made by the Government. Once the fact that the properties
were assigned to Perumalsamy by the Government is admitted, the plaintiff cannot be non suited
mearly because, he produced the order of assignment at the later stage. The receipt of the order of
assignment by the appellate Court under order XLI Rule 27 of C.P.C., cannot be faulted because of
absence of oral evidence.
10. As regards the other claim, it is common knowledge that sons join fathers in execution of Sale
Deed by way of abundant caution at the instance of the purchaser/s. Mererly because a son joins the
execution of Sale Deed by the father, there cannot be a presumption that the properties are ancestral
properties or joint family properties in which the son acquires a http://www.judis.nic.in
S.A.No.1224 of 2019 and right by birth. A property which is assigned to an individual by the
Government cannot and will not par take the character of ancestral property.
11. Therefore, I do not see any perversity in the findings of the appellate Court with reference to title
of Perumalsamy. I do not think that there is any question of law, much less substantial question of
law which would enable me to entertain the second appeal. The appeal therefore fails and it is
dismissed accordingly without being admitted. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petition is closed.
