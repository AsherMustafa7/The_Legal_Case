Mr. N. Jotendro, Sr. Adv.

Date of Hearing and reserving Judgment & Order :: 11.10.2023 Date of Judgment & Order ::
30.10.2023 JUDGMENT AND ORDER (CAV) Heard Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel
for the applicants; M. N. Jotendro, the learned senior counsel for the private respondents; Mr. M.
Devananda, the learned Additional Advocate General for the respondent State and Mr. Kh. Samarjit,
the learned DSGI for the respondent Union of India.
2. This petition has been filed by the applicants to implead them as party respondents in Review
Application No.12 of 2023 filed by the private respondents.
3. Review Application No.12 of 2023 has been filed by the respondents 1 to 8 to review/modify para
No.17(iii) of the MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 12 of 2023) Page |5 judgment

and order dated 27.3.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No.229 of 2023 as under:
"The first respondent shall consider the case of the petitioners by sending
recommendation which would be in the wisdom and realm of the State Government
in reply to the letter dated 29.05.2013 of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government
of India, expeditiously preferred within a period of one year from the date of order in
WP(C) No.229 of 2023 dated 27.03.2023 in term of the averments set out in the writ
petition and in the line of the order passed in W.P.(C) No.4281 of 2002 dated
26.05.2003 by the Gauhati High Court."
4. Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for the applicants submitted that filing of Review
Application No.12 of 2023 itself is mala fide and designed to sabotage the appeal pending before the
Division Bench of this Court because if the order is modified the appeal cannot be allowed and a
fresh appeal will have to be filed.
5. The learned senior counsel for the applicants would submit that the applicants are likely to be
affected by any order to be made in the Review Application, as the Review Application is
MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 12 of 2023) Page |6 not maintainable. The order
sought in review amounts to a re- hearing and re-working which does not fall within the parameters
of the review. Further, no order even to consider the representation can be made by this Court, as
there is no material on record and no material exists to show that the Meiteis/Meeteis are backward
or even to show that they are tribals. Therefore, the applicants are necessary parties in the Review
Application No.12 of 2023. No prejudice would be caused to the private respondents, if the
applicants are impleaded as party respondents in the Review Application No.12 of 2023. Thus, a
prayer has been made to implead the applicants as party respondents in Review Application No.12
of 2023.
6. Per contra, Mr. N. Jotendro, the learned senior counsel appearing for the private
respondents/Review petitioner submitted that the respondents 1 to 8 herein are not barred by any
law to prefer the Review Application as they have not preferred any appeal challenging the judgment
and order dated 27.3.2023 passed in the writ petition. However, the second applicant herein along
with other applicants have filed M.C. (WA) No.88 of 2023 praying for allowing them to file third
party appeal against the judgment and order dated 27.3.2023 passed in the writ petition and the
said miscellaneous case is pending consideration. MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet.
No. 12 of 2023) Page |7
7. The learned senior counsel for the respondents 1 to 8 further submitted that even if the Review
Application filed by the respondents 1 to 8 is allowed, the right of the applicants is not affected.
Moreover, the applicants have failed to demonstrate what right has been affected while directing to
the State Government to expedite the process for consideration which is pending for the last 10
years and which decision of the State Government either may be positive or negative but the
decision should be taken up in accordance with law.

8. The learned senior counsel for the respondents 1 to 8 would submit that the applicants do not
have any right to seek the relief for impleadment in the present Review Application and, thus, a
prayer has been made to dismiss the present petition.
9. This Court also heard the submissions of Mr. M. Devananda, the learned Additional Advocate
General for the respondent State as well as Mr. Kh. Samarjit, learned DSGI for the respondent
Union of India.
10. The applicants seek to implead them as party respondents in Review Application No.12 of 2023
filed by the respondents 1 to 8 herein mainly on the ground that the applicants are likely to be vitally
affected by any order to be made in the MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 12 of
2023) Page |8 Review Application No.12 of 2023, as the said Review Application at the hands of the
respondents 1 to 8 is not at all maintainable. Further, as against the order dated 27.3.2023 passed in
the writ petition, an appeal has already been preferred.
11. The learned senior counsel for the applicants contended that direction to the State Government
to consider the representation of Meetei parties cannot be made because no material has been
placed on record before the learned Single Judge to show that the Meeteis are even a tribe of
Manipur let alone a Scheduled Tribe. The community which seeks to usurp the benefits available to
the Scheduled Tribe though they are a dominant, forward, economically advanced and educationally
advanced community are doing mala fide. They seek to illegally use the High Court as a post office
wrongly assuming that the High Court will mechanically refer the representation of the Meetei to
the State for consideration. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the order of the High
Court dated 27.3.2023 directing the State Government to consider the representation of the Meetei
will create the impression that if the High Court has made such an order than surely there must be
merit in such a representation. This is why even an order "to consider" should not be made.
According to the learned senior counsel for the MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No.
12 of 2023) Page |9 applicants, the direction to the State Government to consider the representation
of the private respondents would have a cascading effect as a precedent throughout the country as
dominant groups will make representation to the State and then rush to the High Court to obtain
similar such orders.
12. First of all, the merits of the Review Application filed by the respondents 1 to 8 cannot be gone
into in the present petition for impleadment.
13. The point arises for consideration in the present petition is whether the applicants are to be
impleaded as party respondents or not in the Review Application No.12 of 2023 as prayed for by
them.
14. The applicants herein are Tribal Youth Volunteers' Organisation and All Tribal Disabled Union
respectively. The applicants themselves stated that they have filed MC (WA) No.88 of 2023 to
permit them to file third party appeal against the order dated 27.3.2023 passed in W.P.(C) No.229
of 2023 and the said miscellaneous case is pending consideration. Once the applicants have filed
appeal against the order dated 27.3.2023 passed in the writ petition, filing of petition to implead
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155226503/ 5
Unknown vs Shri Mutum Churamani Meetei on 30 October, 2023
them as MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:- Review Pet. No. 12 of 2023) P a g e | 10 party
respondents in the Review Application filed by the respondents 1 to 3 is not permissible.
15. According to Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for the applicants, as per Order 47,
Rule 1 CPC, the Review Petition No.12 of 2023 filed by the respondents 1 to 8 is not maintainable, as
the applicants have already preferred an appeal. The respondents 1 to 8 can take all the pleas before
the appellate court. In fact, the hearing of the appeal on the last occasion went on in respect of the
arguments on the merits of the appeal and the Division Bench orally observed that both parties can
argue the appeal itself and, therefore, it is not necessary to proceed with the review.
16. As stated supra, the applicants themselves admitted that the second applicant and others have
filed an appeal against the order dated 27.3.2023 passed in the writ petition. Once they have
invoked the appellate jurisdiction by filing an appeal, the applicants have no right to seek
impleadment in the review application filed by the original writ petitioners. Since the applicants
have no right to seek the relief for impleadment in Review Application No.12 of 2023, this Court is
of the view that the present petition is liable to be dismissed. MC(Rev.Pet.) No. 16 of 2023 (Ref:-
Review Pet. No. 12 of 2023) P a g e | 11
17. Accordingly, MC (Rev.Pet) No.16 of 2023 in Review Application No.12 of 2023 is dismissed. No
costs.
It is made clear that the merits of the review/modification, as prayed for by the respondents 1 to 8,
have not been delved into in this order.
