COMMON JUDGMENT
(Delivered by T.S.Sivagnanam, J.) These appeals have been filed by the appellant/assessees under
Section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) challenging the
common order dated 25.04.2019, made in I.T.A.No.3434/ http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645,
646 & 647 of 2019 Chny/2018, I.T.A.No.3433/Chny/2018 and I.T.A.No.3432/Chny/2018 on the file
of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal 'C' (SMC) Bench, Chennai (for brevity “the Tribunal”) for the
assessment years 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2014-15 respectively.
2.Before us, there are two assessees, viz., Vaduganathan Talkies, whose relevant assessment year is
2014-15 and Lena Talkies, whose assessment years are 2014-15 and 2015-16.
3.The assessees have raised the following substantial questions of law for consideration of this
Court:-
“1. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in not
looking into proviso to Section 40A(3) wherein no disallowance can be made
u/s.40A(3) having regard to the nature and extent of banking facilities available,
consideration of business expediency and other relevant factors?

M/S.Vaduganathan Talkies vs Income Tax Officer on 22 September, 2020
2. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
holding that Rule 6DD has not been satisfied, without looking into the
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 legality that second
proviso to Section 40A(3) is a substantive provision of the law and satisfaction of
Rule 6DD will not affect the exemption from the rigor of Section 40A(3)?
3. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
confirming the addition when the assessee had discharged its onus of proving the
genuineness of the transactions and identity of the film producers/distributors? and
4. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in
rejecting the documents like copies of agreements and confirmation from film
distributors and film producers filed at the time of hearing without restoring the
matter to the lower authorities to check on the veracity of the documents filed?”
4.It is an admitted case of the assessees that cash payments were effected by the assessees for the
purpose of acquiring rights to screen movies in their theatres. The Assessing Officer referring to
Section 40A(3) of the Act held that the cash payments exceeded Rs.20,000/- and ran to several lakh
of rupees and accordingly, disallowed the expenses under http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645,
646 & 647 of 2019 Section 40A(3) of the Act and completed the assessment under Section 143(3) of
the Act by order dated 30.06.2016. The assessees preferred appeals before the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals)-14, Chennai (for brevity “the CIT(A)). The appeals were dismissed by order
dated 28.09.2018. Challenging the same, the assessees filed appeals before the Tribunal, which were
dismissed by the impugned order.
5.The learned Senior Counsel would contend that the assessees had produced a list containing the
payments made by the assessees in cash to various parties, those payees were identifiable and the
assessees also produced letters from the payees to show that the payees have received the money
and accounted for the same in their books and the payees had also furnished their Permanent
Account Numbers (PAN). Therefore, it is submitted that the genuineness of the transactions can
never be doubted more particularly when, 75% of the payments effected by the assessees were
through banking channel, that is, through cheques or bank drafts. This aspect was not even
considered by the Assessing Officer or for that matter the CIT(A) or the Tribunal and therefore, it is
submitted that the http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 genuineness of the
transactions is a very relevant factor, which should be taken into consideration. In this regard,
reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Attar Singh Gurmuk
Singh Etc. vs. Income Tax Officer [(1991) 191 ITR 0667]. It is submitted that this decision was
followed by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in the case of CIT vs. Chrome Leather Co. (P)
Ltd. [(1999) 235 ITR 0708].
6.Further, it is submitted that the conduct of the assessees also should have been noted because it is
not as if the Assessing Officer had culled out these details by himself during the course of
assessment, but these details were disclosed in the Auditors' report filed by the assessees. Further, it
is submitted that the Central Board of Direct Taxes has issued guidelines in Circular No.220, dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133575968/ 3
M/S.Vaduganathan Talkies vs Income Tax Officer on 22 September, 2020
31.05.1997 prescribing limits – circumstances when Income Tax Officers can relax requirements of
making payments in excess of the stipulated amount. It is submitted that the Hon'ble Division
Bench in Chrome Leather Co. (P) Ltd. (supra) had considered the circular and held that the
circumstances mentioned therein are illustrative and not exhaustive and the underlying idea of the
circular is that if the identity of the payee is http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of
2019 known, it would be possible for the Income Tax Officer to cross check whether the transaction
had, in fact, taken place.
7.Further, it is submitted that as held in Attar Singh Gurmuk Singh (supra), Section 40A(3) of the
Act must not be read in isolation or to the exclusion of Rule 6DD of the Income Tax Rules, 1962
(hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”) and the Section must be read along with the Rule. Reliance
was placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.A.Builders Ltd. vs. CIT(A) [(2007)
288 ITR 1 (SC)] to explain as to what is business expediency and that the Assessing Officer cannot
put himself in the arm-chair of the businessman or in the position of the Board of Directors and
assume the role to decide how much is reasonable to explain. Thus, the learned Senior Counsel
submitted that a verification needs to be done by the authorities or at least by the Tribunal to
examine the genuineness of the plea raised by the assessees.
8.The learned Standing Counsel for the Revenue submitted that the assessees have not been able to
bring their cases under any one of the http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
exceptional circumstances in Rule 6DD and having failed to bring the same under the exceptional
clauses, the authorities as well as the Tribunal rightly denied relief to the assessees. Further, it is
submitted that the assessees did not furnish the full details in the relevant column in the return of
income and these details were available only in the annual report, which will go to show the conduct
of the assessees. It is further submitted that the assessees are established parties and therefore, to
say that they effected cash payments due to certain circumstances is an unacceptable plea. That
apart, both the assessees are based on Chennai and nothing prevented them to avoid payment
through banking channels. Further, the assessees have failed to prove unavoidable circumstances,
which necessitated payments by cash over and above a sum of Rs.20,000/-. Further, the
genuineness of the transaction is not a factor to be considered while deciding a case under Section
40A(3) of the Act. Further, it is submitted that commercial expediency or business expediency
depends on facts and, the authorities rightly concluded on facts against the assessees. In support of
her contention, the learned Standing Counsel referred to the following decisions:-
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
(i) D.S.Madiahswamy vs. ITO [T.C.(A) No.166 of 2011: dated 22.01.2019];

9.We have elaborately heard Mr.R.L.Ramani, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Ms.C.P.Priya,
learned counsel for the assessees and http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
Ms.S.Premalatha, learned Standing Counsel for Mr.M.Swaminathan, learned Senior Standing
Counsel appearing for the Revenue.
10.Section 40A deals with expenses or payments not deductible in certain circumstances. In this
case, we are concerned about the applicability of Section 40A(3) on the assessees. For better
reference, we quote the said sub-Section along with the first proviso hereunder:-
“Section 40A(3):- Where the assessee incurs any expenditure in respect of which a
payment or aggregate of payments made to a person in a day, otherwise than by an
account payee cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank draft, exceeds twenty
thousand rupees, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of such expenditure.
Provided that no disallowance shall be made and no payment shall be deemed to be
the profits and gains of business or profession under sub-section (3) and this
sub-section where a payment or aggregate of payments made to a person in a day,
otherwise than by an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank
draft, exceeds twenty thousand rupees, in such cases and http://www.judis.nic.in
T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 under such circumstances as may be prescribed,
having regard to the nature and extent of banking facilities available, considerations
of business expediency and other relevant factors.”
11.In terms of the above provision, where the assessee incurs expenditure in respect of which a
payment or aggregate of payments made to a person in a day, otherwise than by an account payee
cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank draft or through electronic clearing system, exceeds
twenty thousand rupees, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of such expenditure. The proviso
gives a window to the assessees and it states that no disallowance shall be made and no payments
shall be deemed to be profits and gains of business or profession under sub-Section (3) of Section
40A, where payment exceeds twenty thousand rupees in such cases under such circumstances as
may be prescribed, having regard to the nature and extent of banking facilities available,
consideration of business expediency and other relevant factors, the circumstances which have been
prescribed under Rule 6DD of the Rules.
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133575968/ 5
M/S.Vaduganathan Talkies vs Income Tax Officer on 22 September, 2020
12.Rule 6DD of the Rules deals with cases and circumstances in which a payment or aggregate of
payments exceeding twenty thousand rupees may be made to a person in a day, otherwise than by
an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or account payee bank draft. Various circumstances have
been set out in clauses (a) to (l) of Rule 6DD of the Rules.
13.We have carefully gone through all the clauses under Rule 6DD of the Rules and we find that the
assessees cannot bring their cases under any one of the clauses as enumerated under Rule 6DD of
the Rules. The issue before us is whether the Assessing Officer committed an error in not verifying
the details given by the assessees, explaining the genuineness of the transaction, stating that the
payees are identifiable, they have, in writing, confirmed receipt of payment, disclosed their PAN
numbers and without verifying these details, was the Assessing Officer justified in throwing out the
assessee's case and effecting the deduction under Section 40A(3) of the Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
14.As rightly pointed out by the learned Standing Counsel for the respondent, the Commercial
expediency or business expediency has to be decided on the facts of each case. From the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it appears that genuineness may be one of the factors to be taken note
of, in our view, while considering as to whether the case would fall within any one of the
circumstances set out in Rule 6DD of the Rules and not otherwise. We have seen the chart showing
the payments effected by the assessees to various parties. The payments effected through the year
under consideration is substantial.
15.It is the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that only 25% of the
payments effected by the assessees were by cash and the remaining 75% was through banking
channels, that is, through cheque or demand draft. These factors will work against the assessees
because the assessees are fully aware of the legal position that over and above Rs.20,000/-, the
assessees would not be entitled to effect payment in cash in a day. Thus, merely because the
assessees were able to identify the payees, who were more than 20 in number, would not be a
mitigating factor http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 to grant relief to the
assessees under the first proviso to Section 40A(3) of the Act.
16.On more aspect to be noted is that there has been periodical payments in cash. The explanation
offered by the assessees is that due to compelling circumstances, they have to effect cash payments.
The Revenue is right in their submission that the registered offices of the assessee-firm are in
Chennai and therefore, it is not as if there were no banking facilities available in Chennai, nor any
other exceptional circumstances, which compelled the assessees to make urgent cash payments. In
the decisions referred to on either side, it is seen that in majority of the cases, it is a solitary payment
or a few payments made under extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, the fact that the assessees
had been regularly effecting payments in cash would be a circumstance which will work against the
assessee.
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133575968/ 6
M/S.Vaduganathan Talkies vs Income Tax Officer on 22 September, 2020
17.The learned Senior Counsel sought to distinguish the decision in N.Mohammed Ali (supra) by
contending that on facts, the Court found that the names of the agencies and agents or retailers were
never furnished, contrary to the case of the assessees, where full details have been furnished.
However, the correct test to be applied is to examine as to whether the expenses would fall under
any one of the exceptional circumstances set out in Rule 6DD of the Rules. Considering the facts of
the case, the concept regarding business expediency or commercial expediency can hardly be
canvassed by the assessees, as the assessees had been periodically adopting the modes by effecting
cash payments. Therefore, concurrently the two authorities and the Tribunal have held against the
assessees and we are not expected to examine the correctness of the impugned order as if exercising
powers as the third appellate authority and what we are expected to do is to consider as to whether
any substantial question of law arises for consideration in these appeals, while exercising power
under Section 260A of the Act.
18.In the light of the above discussion, we find that no question of http://www.judis.nic.in
T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 law, much less substantial question of law arises for consideration
in these appeals.
19.It is noteworthy to point out that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Attar Singh Gurmuk
Singh (supra), while testing the constitutional validity of Section 40A(3) of the Act, took note of Rule
6DD of the Rules as it stood then, which read as follows:-
“In our opinion, there is little merit in this contention. Section 40A(3) must not be
read in isolation or to the exclusion of Rule 6DD. The Section must be read along
with the Rule. If read together, it will be clear that the provi- sions are not intended to
restrict the business activities. There is no restriction on the assessee in his trading
activities. Section 40A(3) only empowers the assessing officer to disallow the
deduction claimed as expenditure in respect of which payment is not made by
crossed cheque or crossed bank draft. The payment by crossed cheque or crossed
bank draft is insisted on to enable the assessing authority to ascertain whether the
payment was genuine or whether it was out of the income from disclosed sources.
The terms of http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 Section
40A(3) are not absolute. Consideration of business expediency and other relevant
factors are not excluded. The genuine and bona fide transactions are not taken out of
the sweep of the Section. It is open to the assessee to furnish to the satisfaction of the
assessing officer the circumstances under which the payment in the manner
prescribed in Section 40A(3) was not practicable or would have caused genuine
difficulty to the payee. It is also open to the assessee to identify the person who has
received the cash payment. Rule 6DD provides that an asses- see can be exempted
from the requirement of payment by a crossed cheque or crossed bank draft in the
circumstances specified under the rule. It will be clear from the provisions of Section
40A(3) and rule 6DD that they are intended to regulate the business transactions and
to prevent the use of unaccounted money or reduce the chances to use black- money
for business transactions. See: Mudiam Oil Company v. ITO, [1973] 92 ITR 519 A.P.
If the payment is made by a crossed cheque drawn on a bank or a crossed bank draft
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133575968/ 7
M/S.Vaduganathan Talkies vs Income Tax Officer on 22 September, 2020
then it will be easier to ascertain, when deduction is claimed, whether the payment
was genuine and whether it was out of the income from http://www.judis.nic.in
T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019 disclosed sources. In interpreting a taxing statute
the Court cannot be oblivious of the proliferation of black- money which is under
circulation in our country. Any restraint intended to curb the chances and
opportunities to use or create black-money should not be regarded as curtailing the
freedom of trade or business.”
20.Taking note of Clause (j) in Rule 6DD as it stood then, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
when Section 40A(3) is read along with Rule 6DD of the Rules, it gives adequate protection to the
assessees. This decision was referred to in Chrome Leather Co. (P) Ltd. (supra), as the case
pertained to the assessment year 1974-75, when the old Rule 6DD(j) was in existence. However, the
assessment years under consideration in these appeals are 2014-15 and 2015-16 when the said Rules
stood deleted and therefore, the Revenue is right in contending that the genuinity of the transaction
is hardly a matter, which should weigh in the minds of the Assessing officer while examining as to
the whether the assessees had violated Section 40A(3) of the Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in T.C.A.Nos.645, 646 & 647 of 2019
21.For the above reasons, the appeals stand dismissed holding that no substantial question of law
arises for consideration in these appeals. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition
is closed.
