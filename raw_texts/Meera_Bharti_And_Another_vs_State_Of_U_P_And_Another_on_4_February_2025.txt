3. Brief facts of the case are that an FIR has been lodged on 01.07.2021 by Suresh Giri against six
persons including the applicants with the allegations that marriage of daughter of opposite party
no.2 was solemnized with the son of applicants on 17.02.2016 according to Hindu rites and rituals.
The opposite party no.2 had given dowry as per his capability and capacity. The son of applicants
was working as Sipahi (sepoy) in the Army and the applicant no.2 i.e. father-in-law of daughter of
opposite party no.2 was working as Subedar in the Indian Army. After passage of some time, the
applicants along with other family members raised additional dowry demand of Rs.5,00,000/- and
a four wheeler. The daughter of opposite party no.2 was mentally and physically harassed by the
applicants and other family members for fulfillment of additional dowry demand as raised by them.
On 25.08.2016, when the daughter of opposite party no.2 came out of the bathroom, she was caught
hold by her devar-Raja and was dragged to the bedroom where he did objectionable act with her.
When the daughter of opposite party no.2 shared this incident with her husband, he instead of
scolding his brother, assaulted the daughter of opposite party no.2 and raised the additional dowry
demand stating that till she brings the amount as demanded by them, this behaviour will continue
with her. The daughter of opposite party no.2 kept quite as she wanted to stay peacefully at her
in-laws' place.
4. It has been further alleged that in May, 2016, the applicant no.2 i.e. father-in-law of daughter of
opposite party no.2, finding her alone, entered her room and did objectionable act with her. She did
not share the incident with any one with the hope that things would subside with passage of time. In
the meantime, she was blessed with a girl child. The applicants as well as other family members
were not happy with the birth of a girl child and she was mentally and physically tortured by all the
persons named in the FIR for giving birth to a girl child.
5. When the daughter of opposite party no.2 conceived again and as the applicants were longing for
a boy, therefore, they got her fetal sex examination conducted and on finding out that it is a female
child, in a planned manner with the intention to get the child aborted, on 16.04.2019 at around
12:30, they pushed her from the first floor which resulted in fracture at several places i.e. spinal
cord, hip and legs. She also suffered miscarriage. She was not taken to the hospital by the applicants
and was pressurized not to share the aforesaid incident with any one or be ready to face dire
consequences. Four hours after the incident, on repeated requests of daughter of opposite party
no.2, she was taken to Military Hospital where she was given treatment. As she was threatened by
the applicants not to share the aforesaid incident, therefore, she did not disclose about the same as
she was afraid of the conduct of the applicants. The spinal cord of the daughter of opposite party
no.2 was operated at Command Hospital, Chandigarh and she was again referred to Military
Hospital, Patiala. She was discharged from the aforesaid hospital on wheelchair. After her discharge
from Military Hospital, she started staying with her husband at Patiala.
6. Another incident happened when she was pushed from the wheelchair and she suffered fracture
in her thigh, for which she was again treated. It has been further alleged that on 20.07.2020, the
husband of daughter of opposite party no.2 asked the car driver to drop her to her parents place at
Sahibabad after which on 31.07.2020, neither the applicants nor the son of the applicants have ever
been in contact with the daughter of opposite party no.2 and are not paying even a single penny for
the maintenance of daughter as well as grand-daughter of opposite party no.2. The son of the

Meera Bharti And Another vs State Of U.P. And Another on 4 February, 2025
applicants has also filed a divorce petition. The condition of daughter of opposite party no.2 is very
poor as she is on wheelchair, therefore, the present FIR has been lodged. After investigation, charge
sheet has been submitted against the applicants under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506, 313, 325, 307,
354 (Ka), 354 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act. The investigation against the husband and others is
pending.
7. Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the present FIR has been lodged with false and
frivolous allegations. He further contends that there are general, omnibus and vague allegations
against the applicants who are mother-in-law and father-in-law of daughter of opposite party no.2.
The FIR has been lodged by the opposite party no.2 whereas the incident as narrated in the FIR has
not been spoken about by the victim in her statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C., therefore,
the present FIR has been lodged for the purpose of harassing the applicants. He further submits that
from the statement of the victim as well as the version of the FIR, no offence against the applicants
is disclosed and the present prosecution has been instituted with a mala fide intention for the
purpose of causing harassment. He, therefore, submits that the charge-sheet, summoning order as
well as entire proceedings be quashed by this Court as the same is an abuse process of Court.
8. Learned A.G.A. for the State on the other hand submits that from the version of the FIR and the
details regarding the incidents which have resulted in such a condition of daughter of opposite party
no.2 who is on wheelchair, offences under the relevant sections are made out. Details and specific
dates of the incidents have been given which have not been denied by the applicants at any point of
time. From the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. also, the allegation regarding
misbehavior by father-in-law is proved. He further submits that all the contentions raised by the
applicants' counsel relates to disputed questions of fact. On the basis of material on record after
conducting of statutory investigation under Chapter XII Cr.P.C. by the investigating officer, a strong
prima facie case is made out against the applicant for the commission of the alleged incident. In
support of his case, learned A.G.A. has placed reliance upon the judgments of the Apex Court in the
case of Dilbag Rai Vs. State of Haryana & Others reported in AIR 2019 (SC) 693 and Central Bureau
of Investigation Vs. Arvind Khanna reported in MANU/SC/1432/2019.
9. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have gone
through the records of the present application.
10. This Court finds that the submissions made by the applicants' learned counsel call for
adjudication on pure questions of fact which may adequately be adjudicated upon only by the trial
court and while doing so even the submissions made on points of law can also be more appropriately
gone into by the trial court in this case. The issue whether it is appropriate for this Court being the
Highest Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the charge-sheet and
the proceedings at the stage when the Magistrate has merely issued process against the applicants
and trial is to yet to come only on the submission made by the learned counsel for the applicants
that present criminal case initiated by opposite party no.2 are not only malicious but also abuse of
process of law has elaborately been discussed by the Apex Court in the following judgments:-

(vii) Nallapareddy Sridhar Reddy Vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.; 2020 0
Supreme (SC) 45, and laslty
(viii) Rajeev Kaurav Vs. Balasahab & Others; 2020 0 Supreme (SC) 143.
11. In view of the aforesaid, this Court does not deem it proper, and therefore cannot be persuaded
to have a pre-trial before the actual trial begins. A threadbare discussion of various facts and
circumstances, as they emerge from the allegations made against the accused, is being purposely
avoided by the Court for the reason, lest the same might cause any prejudice to either side during
trial. But it shall suffice to observe that the perusal of the F.I.R. and the material collected by the
Investigating Officer on the basis of which the charge sheet has been submitted makes out a prima
facie case against the accused at this stage and there appear to be sufficient ground for proceeding
against the accused. I do not find any justification to quash the charge sheet or the proceedings
against the applicants arising out of them as the case does not fall in any of the categories recognized
by the Apex Court which may justify their quashing.
12. The prayer for quashing the charge sheet dated 03.06.2023 along with Cognizance/Summoning
order dated 03.01.2024 and the entire proceeding of Criminal Case No.02211 of 2024 (State vs.
Meera Bharti & Another), arising out of Case Crime No.1407 of 2021, under Sections 498-A, 323,
504, 506, 313, 325, 307, 354(A), 354 I.P.C. and Section 3/4 D.P. Act, Police Station- Sahibabad,
District- Ghaziabad is refused, as I do not see any abuse of the court's process at this pre-trial stage.
13. The present application has no merit and is, accordingly, rejected.
