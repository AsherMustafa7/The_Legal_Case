Ambassador Car at Chandmari Road, Kankarbagh, Patna. From the said car 80 Kg. of Charas was
recovered which was concealed beneath the rear seat and the space behind the back of the rear seat.
The Ambassador car bearing registration no. URD- 2626 was intercepted near the rented house of
Anjani Kumar Singh [appellant in Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 484 of 2013] at Chandmari Road,
Kankarbagh, Patna. Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 The Central
Excise team at the time of interception had noticed that four accused persons namely: Anjani Kumar
Singh (appellant), Mundrika Singh (since dead), Sidheshwar Singh (P.W.
13) and Nagendra Singh [ appellant in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 564 of 2013] were about to board the
said car. However, Anjani Kumar Singh and Nagendra Kumar managed to escape from the place of
interception but Sidheshwar Singh and Mundrika Singh were apprehended and brought to the office
/premises of Central Excise, Patna for interrogation where both of them accepted their guilt.
Mundrika Singh accepted that he was the brother of Anjani Kumar Singh and his name was in the
owner book of the car in question. Subsequently, interrogation of Mundrika Singh and Sidheshwar
Singh revealed that Sidheshwar Singh had gone to the house of Anjani Kumar Singh for the said car
which he had hired on rent and had paid Rs. 500/- in advance to Anjani Kumar Singh few days
back. He was to take the car to Dariyapur in connection with a marriage ceremony. They suggested
that Sidheshwar Singh was not involved in trafficking of Charas. On 28.02.1996 itself accused-
Mundrika Singh was forwarded and produced before the learned Additional Sessions Judge VII,
Patna and a case was initiated vide Special Case No. 12 of 1996. After conducting detailed enquiry
and collecting necessary reports finally a Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt.

and Nagendra Kumar. The complaint was filed by Sri Shailendra Kumar, Inspector, Central Excise,
Bokaro who has been examined as P.W. 1 during the trial. In the complaint petition it was disclosed

Nepal in bulk quantity was concealed in a secret cavity beneath the rear seat of car No. URD 2626
which was parked in Chandmari Road, Kankarbagh. Acting on the above referred secret
information, the officers of Narcotics Cell of Central Excise, Patna intercepted the Ambassador Car
bearing registration No. URD2626 on 27.02.1996 at 9.00 hrs. parked near the house of Anjani
Kumar Singh, Chandmari Road, Kankarbagh, Patna. At the time of interception of above said car,
four persons were found near the alleged car who were about to board the car and on being asked
one person namely Anjani Kumar Singh presented himself as the owner of the alleged car, second
person namely Mundrika Singh presented himself as the own brother of Anjani Kumar Singh , the
third person namely Nagendra Kumar presented himself as the driver of the alleged car, and the last
Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 person namely Sidheshwar Singh
presented himself as the client, who had gone there to take the alleged car on hire for marriage
purpose. After disclosing the identify, the officers of Narcotics Cell of Central Excise, Patna
expressed their desire to conduct the search in the alleged car. On being asked to open the dickey of
the car, Nagendra Kumar and Anjani Kumar Singh went inside the house of Anjani Kumar Singh on
the pretext to fetch the key of the car but both of them escaped away. Sidheshwar Singh and
Mundrika Singh were taken in custody and were brought to the office premises of Central Revenue
Building along with the alleged car no. URD 2626 in which the contraband Charas was reported to
be concealed. In presence of independent witnesses as well as in presence of Sidheshwar Singh and
Mundrika Singh the alleged Ambassador car bearing Reg. No. URD - 2626 was thoroughly searched
and some packets of black substance wrapped in plastic were recovered from the secret cavity made
behind the back of the rear seat and from beneath of the rear seat of the car. On examination, the
recovered black substance was found to be Charas and on weighment (on the portable weighing
scale) the total weight of the recovered Charas came to 80 Kg. (gross). After observing all necessary
formalities, recovered 80 Kg of Charas and the alleged Ambassador Car No. URD 2626 were seized
for the Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 violation of Section 8 of the
N.D.P.S. Act. Panchnama and seizure memo were prepared and the signature of Sri Sidheshwar
Singh and Mundrika Singh besides other witnesses was obtained on such documents in taken of
proof of recovery of contraband Charas.
05. In course of search of the alleged car, besides contraband Charas weighing 80 Kg the
registration certificate of the alleged car was also recovered which showed that the same had been
transferred from Kanpur to Patna D.T.O. The Registration certificate was in the name of one Abdul
Hamid of Kanpur and his local address was shown as C/o Mundrika Singh, Patrakar Nagar,
Kankarbagh, Patna. The statement of Sidheshwar Singh and Mundrika Singh was recorded and both
of them were interrogated. In course of interrogation both of the above named person confirmed
that the owner of the car no. URD - 2626 was Sri Anjani Kumar Singh who had purchased the
alleged car two years back and the car was being plied on hire by Anjani Kumar Singh. They also
confirmed that Nagendra Kumar was the driver of the said car. In course of interrogation

his car on hire for his relatives marriage and according to their agreement Sidheshwar Singh had
gone to the house of Anjani Kumar Singh on 27.02.96 at Chandmari Road, Patna High Court CR.

06. During investigation no corroborative evidence was brought on record regarding involvement of
Sidheshwar Singh and as such he was not forwarded as accused. After forwarding the Central Excise
investigated the matter. Accordingly, on the prayer of complainant warrant of arrest against Anjani
Kumar Singh and Nagendra Kumar was issued but it could not be executed by the Police Officer of
Karai Police Station since they were reported to be absconding however subsequently Anjani Kumar
Singh and Nagendra Kumar surrendered before the court below on different dates and after only
being bailed out Anjani Kumar Singh appeared before the complainant and flatly denied all the
allegation. Even he denied the ownership of the alleged car. He also denied that he was residing at
Chandmari Road, Kankarbagh, Patna. However he accepted that on 27.02.1996 he was present in
the same house which belonged to his elder brother. Appellant- Nagendra Kumar did not appear
before the complainant. In course of investigation it was found that alleged Ambassador car bearing
Registration No. URD- 2626 was purchased by Mundrika Singh from one Abdul Hamid of 105/61
Chamanganj, Kanpur on Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 13.01.1994
and no objection certificate in this regard was taken by Abdul Hamid from D.T.O. Kanpur. The
registration certificate of the alleged car was found also corroborative of the aforesaid facts.
07. In course of investigation the sample of seized Charas weighing 80 Kg. was got tested in Forensic
Science Laboratory, Patna from where the same was confirmed to be Charas. In a bid to dispose of
the seized Charas weighing 80 Kg. learned Special Court was requested to depute a Magistrate for
the purpose of issuance of certificate under Section 52 A of the NDPS Act and on direction of
learned Special Court same was got certified by learned Judicial Magistrate, Civil Court, Patna who
physically verified the seized Charas and found to be 83 Kg. (gross) including the weight of wrapper
of the seized Charas. Along with the complaint petition relevant documents, such as: (1)
Panchnama; (2) Seizure Memo; (3) Statement Of Mundrika Singh, (4) Statement Of Sidheshwar
Singh, (5) Letter of Abdul Hamid, (6) Delivery letter of Car, (7) No objection certificate, (8)
Registration Certificate, (9) Letter of Karai Police Station, (10) Statement of Anjani Kumar Singh,
(11) Test Report, (12) Certification of seized Charas were filed and twelve persons were cited as
prosecution witnesses; namely:- (01) A.K. Singh, Superintendent, Central Excise, Patna; (02)
Samrendra Singh, Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 Inspector,
Central Excise, Patna; (03) Shailendra Kumar Singh, Inspector, Central Excise, Patna; (04) Mithlesh
Kumar Singh, Sepoy, Central Excise, Patna, (05) Shyam Bihari Singh, Sepoy, Central Excise, Patna;
(06) K.K. Sharma, Sepoy, Central Excise, Patna; (07) Bharat Paswan, Sepoy, Central Excise, Patna,
(08) Dina Nath Kumar, Sepoy, Central Excise, Patna, (09) B.B. Pandey, Driver, Central Excise,
Patna; (10) Nand Kishore Thakur, S/o Village - Mehnore, P.O. - Tungi, District - Nalanda; (11)
Kamal Nayan Sharma, S/o Vill. - Rajpur, P.O. - Neuora, Distt. - Patna; (12) Sidheshwar Singh, S/o
-Late Mahabir Singh, Vill. - Hathila, P.O. - Karai- Parsurai, P.S. - Karai, Distt. - Nalanda.
08. It appears that since the accused persons were absconding and necessary steps were taken to
apprehend them some delay occurred in filing the complaint petition and finally it was filed on
15.03.2002. Thereafter, on 16.08.2005 charge was jointly framed against all the three accused
persons under Section 20(b) (ii)(c) and Section 29 of the NDPS Act and against the appellant
-Anjani Kumar Singh and Mundrika Singh further charge under Section 25 and 27 of the NDPS Act

09. During the trial to establish its case from the prosecution side altogether thirteen witnesses were
examined. Out of them, Shailendra Kumar, Inspector, Central Excise, Bokaro and Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 complainant is P.W. 1; Sri Ajay Kumar Singh,
Superintendent, Narcotics Cell and Team Leader is P.W. 2, P.W. 3 [Samrendra Singh, Inspector,
Central Excise, Patna], P.W. 4 (Mithilesh Kumar Singh, Constable, Central Excise, Patna), P.W. 5
[Shyam Bihari Singh, Constable, Central Excise, Patna], P.W. 6 [Krishna Kumar Sharma, Head
Constable, Central Excise, Patna]; P.W. 7 [Bharat Bhushan Pandey, Driver, Central Excise Patna],
P.W. 8 [Dinanath Kumar Constable , Central Excise, Patna ] and P.W. 9 [Bharat Paswan, Constable,
Central Excise, Patna] all were members of the raiding team whereas P.W. 10 - Nand Kishor Thakur
[ Daily Wager in Central Excise, Patna] and P.W. 11 (Kamal Nayan Sharma, Daily Wage Labour in
Custom Department, Patna) were also witness to the seizure list and Panchanama. P.W. 12 (Sri
Birendra Kumar Singh, learned Judicial Magistrate, Patna) had done certification of the seized
Charas whereas P.W. 13 (Sidheshwar Singh ) who was initially intercepted since did not support the
prosecution case he was declared hostile by the prosecution however he proved his writing and
signature on his interrogatory statement which was marked as Ext. 5.
10. After completion of prosecution evidence the accused persons were questioned with
incriminating circumstances and evidences brought during the trial against them and their Patna
High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 statement under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C.
was recorded in which they claimed to be innocent however from the defence side neither oral nor
documentary evidence has been brought on record.
11. After placing entire evidence, Sri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, learned senior counsel assisted by Sri
Pratik Mishra, learned counsel who has appeared on behalf of the appellant
-Anjani Kumar Singh has argued that the said Ambassador car which was shown to be seized was
not seized while it was inside the premises of the appellant rather it was found in the lane, and as
such, it was not a case of recovery of Charas from conscious and exclusive possession of the
appellant. He submits that there is no explanation as to why Panchnama and seizure list was
prepared at 12.00 noon on 27.02.1996 whereas it was case of prosecution that the said car was
intercepted at 9.00 A.M. on 27.02.1996. He further submits that no reason has been assigned as to
why Panchnama and seizure list was prepared in the office of Central Excise. He further submits
that there is no explanation as to why complaint petition was filed in the court after about six years.
He submits that the car in question was intercepted on 27.02.1996 but in the case complaint was
filed on 15.03.2002. He submits that there are serious inconsistencies in the evidences particularly
on the point of noticing the appellant at the place where the vehicle Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 was seized. He submits that in the evidence of P.W. 1 - Shailendra
Kumar there is serious inconsistency in paragraph nos. 41 and 43 of his cross- examination. As per
Sri Singh, learned senior counsel evidence of P.W. 1 suggests that the appellant was not present at
the place of occurrence. He has also argued that P.W. 2 (Ajay Kumar Singh, Superintendent of
Central Excise, Patna) in paragraph no. 12 of his cross examination has stated that while they
reached near the car in question in Chandmari Road he had seen four persons near the car.
Thereafter, female inmates had provided the key of the vehicle whereupon the vehicle was unlocked
however, P.W. 6 (Krishna Kumar Sharma, Head Havaldar, Custom) in paragraph no.4 of his cross
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107113858/ 7
Puja Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 20 March, 2019
examination has stated that he reached with the team at the place of occurrence and thereafter door
of the vehicle was opened by breaking the door. Sri Singh has also argued that prosecution has failed
to establish that appellant - Anjani Kumar Singh was the owner or joint owner of the car in question.
He submits that P.W. 1 - Shailendra Kumar in paragraph no. 10 of his examination in chief has
stated that during enquiry it transpired that the car in question was lying in the name of Mundrika
Singh as per record available in the DTO Office. He has also argued that the appellant was not
questioned Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 regarding incriminating
circumstances and evidences at the time of recording his statement under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C.
12. Dr. Brahmdeo Prasad, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant - Nagendra Singh
in Cr. Appeal (D.B.) No. 564 of 2013 has argued that only on presumption the appellant was made
accused otherwise there is no evidence that he was on the driving seat or having they key of car
rather it was the case of prosecution that subsequently female inmates of convict -Anjani Kumar
Singh and Mundrika Singh had produced the key of the vehicle.
13. Dr. Anjani Prasad Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of convict -Mundrika Singh in Cr.
Appeal (D.B.) No. 479 of 2013 adopting the argument of Sri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, learned senior
counsel has further argued that in the case nothing was recovered from the car in question and as
such according to learned counsel for the appellant the learned trial judge without any cogent
evidence has passed judgment of conviction and sentence which is required to be interfered with. He
submits that since the husband of Puja Devi, whose name has been substituted in Cr. Appeal (D.B.)
No. 479 of 2013, was incorrectly sentenced and imposed fine, even after death of Mundrika Singh
since Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 conviction was itself incorrect
the fine imposed may not be realized and judgment of conviction is liable to be set aside.
14. On the contrary, Sri S.D. Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General assisted by Sri Manoj
Kumar Singh, learned Central Government Counsel in all the aforesaid appeals has argued that
prosecution has proved its case beyond all reasonable doubts and judgment of conviction and
sentence does not require any interference. He submits that following entire statutory provisions
contained in the NDPS Act search and seizure was conducted, sampling was done and even in
presence of learned Judicial Magistrate, who has been examined as P.W. 12 certification of the
seized Charas was done. He submits that it is a case in which there was recovery of huge quantity of
Charas to the tune of 80 Kg. which was concealed beneath the rear seat and the space behind the
back of the rear seat of the Ambassador car in question. He submits that prosecution has established
its case that the vehicle in question was registered in the name of convict- Mundrika Singh. He
further submits that the vehicle in question was lying just near the house of appellant -Anjani
Kumar Singh and at the time while the raiding party reached near the vehicle appellant -Anjani
Kumar Singh and appellant - Nagendra Singh on one pretext or the other made good their escape
and for a long Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 period despite
issuance of processes they could not be apprehended and this was the reason for delay in filing the
complaint petition. Those facts have already been elaborated in the complaint petition itself and
reiterated during the evidence. According to Sri S.D. Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General
the complaint was filed after thorough enquiry and investigation in consonance with the provisions
of the NDPS Act. He further submits that during enquiry interrogatory statement of convict-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/107113858/ 8
Puja Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 20 March, 2019
Mundrika Singh and P.W. 13 - Sidheshwar Singh was recorded in which convict- Mundrika Singh
had accepted his guilt and it disclosed that he along with his brother - Anjani Kumar Singh and
driver of the vehicle- Nagendra Singh, S/o Mundrika Singh were involved in trafficking huge
quantity of Charas to the tune of 80 Kg. According to Sri Sanjay interrogatory statement recorded
under Section 67 of the NDPS Act is admissible in evidence. Such evidence may not be discarded
treating it as confession before Police. Besides this, it has been argued by Sri S.D. Sanjay, learned
Additional Solicitor General that Section 54 of the NDPS Act prescribes for drawing a presumption
of guilt unless it is proved contrary. He submits that it is not the case of the defence that they were
falsely implicated or they have alleged any malafide against the official witnesses. Sri Sanjay, learned
Additional Solicitor Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 General placing
reliance on the constitution bench judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a case reported in
(2009) 8 SCC 539 Karnail Singh v. State of Haryana corresponding to 2009 AIR SCW 5265 has
argued that substantial compliance of provision under Section 42 of the NDPS Act is required to be
done which has been elaborated in the evidence of the prosecution. He submits that in view of the
facts and circumstances it was compliance of provision under Section 42 of the NDPS Act relating to
search. Sri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, learned senior counsel had also argued that the case is based
only on the evidence of official witnesses and as such the case appears to be doubtful. Replying to
this submission of Sri Kanhaiya Prasad Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant, Sri S.D.
Sanjay, learned Additional Solicitor General has placed heavy reliance on a judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in a case reported in AIR 2013 SUPREME COURT 2068 Ram Swaroop v. State
(Govt. NCT) of Delhi and submits that evidence of official witnesses may not be brushed aside only
on the ground that they are official witnesses. He submits that in the particular facts and
circumstances of a case conviction based only on the evidence of the official witnesses may not be
interfered with. Accordingly it has been argued that learned trial judge on the basis of cogent
evidence has passed Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 judgment of
conviction and sentence which requires no interference.
15. Besides hearing learned counsel for the parties, we have minutely examined entire evidence on
record and after going through the same prima facie we are of opinion that the learned trial judge
has rightly passed judgment of conviction and sentence which requires no interference. However,
before proceeding it would be necessary to succinctly refer to evidence of witnesses. In the case P.W.

18. P.W. 13 (Sidheshwar Singh) was apprehended on 27.02.1996 from near the Ambassador car in
question but since he had disclosed that he had hired the vehicle for marriage purpose which was
corroborated in the statement of Mundrika Singh he Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.484 of
2013 dt. 27-03-2019 was not made accused instead he was made witness to the prosecution and he
was examined as P.W. 13. During his evidence he proved his writing and signature on his
interrogatory statement, which was marked as Ext. 5. However, since he did not support the
prosecution case, he was declared hostile but fact remains that his interrogatory statement recorded
under Section 67 of the NDPS Act is an admissible evidence. In his statement recorded under
Section 67 of the NDPS Act which has been marked as Ext. 5 he stated that on 27.02.1996 he went to
the house of Anjani Kumar Singh which was situated in Chandmari Road side of the temple in
Kankarbagh, Patna for hiring vehicle bearing registration no. U.R.D. 2626. He further stated that
Anjani Kumar Singh was his co-villager. It may be indicated that Sidheshwar Singh had disclosed
that he was resident of village: Hathila, P.S. - Karai, District Nalanda. He further stated that Anjani
Kumar Singh was using to lend his vehicle i.e. U.R.D. 2626 on rental basis. Regarding hiring the
vehicle in question earlier he had discussion with Anjani Kumar Singh who had assured that after
eight days he will provide the vehicle and on the same day i.e. on 27.02.1996 he had gone there for
getting the vehicle on rental of Rs. 800/- for two days i.e. 27th & 28th February, 1996. He also stated
that he had already given advance of Rs. 500/-. On the same day at about 8.45 Patna High Court
CR. APP (DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 in the morning he had reached the house of Anjani
Kumar Singh where Anjani Kumar Singh and his driver- Nagendra Kumar Singh (both appellants)
were present and vehicle was lying there. While he reached there within ten minutes brother of
Anjani Kumar Singh namely, Mundrika Singh also arrived there and all the four persons were near
the vehicle and having discussion. In the meanwhile, officials of Central Excise, Patna arrived there
and enquired from Anjani Kumar Singh however after some time Anjani Kumar Singh and driver-
Nagendra Kumar Singh hoodwinking the officials of Central Excise fled away. However Mundrika
Singh and Sidheshwar Singh were apprehended by the Excise Officials thereafter disclosure was
made. On the basis of facts disclosed in Ext. 5 there was no reason to disbelieve the version of other

Puja Devi vs The State Of Bihar on 20 March, 2019
prosecution witnesses even though P.W. 13 - Sidheshwar Singh was declared hostile. Similarly,
Mundrika Singh and Anjani Kumar Singh also disclosed the facts showing their involvement in
concealment of huge quantity of Charas in the vehicle in question.
19. On examination of entire evidence on record, there is no reason to consider the case of
prosecution as doubtful rather the case appears to be fully proved and Sri S.D. Sanjay, learned
Additional Solicitor General has rightly argued that in absence of Patna High Court CR. APP (DB)
No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 any defence of false implication evidence of official witnesses may
not be ignored. Moreover, only on the ground that the case is based on evidence of official witnesses
conviction and sentence cannot be interfered with if the case is otherwise credible. On going through
entire evidence, we are of considered opinion that prosecution has proved its case and there is no
evidence to show any apparent violation of statutory provisions of the NDPS Act, rather considering
the oral evidence, documentary evidence as well as admission of accused persons which is
admissible under Section 67 of the NDPS Act and provision contained in Section 54 of the NDPS Act
which suggests that presumption would be against accused persons unless specifically disapproved
by them, we are of opinion that there is no need to interfere with the judgment of conviction and
sentence.
20. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction dated 5th April, 2013 and sentenced dated 08.04.2013
passed by Sri D.P. Singh, learned Addl. Sessions Judge VII, Patna -cum - Spl. Judge, NDPS Act
passed in Special Case No. 12 of 1996 is hereby upheld and all the aforesaid three appeals are
dismissed.
21. Appellant - Nagendra Singh is on bail and since judgment of conviction has been upheld and
appeal stood dismissed, his bail bond stands canceled with a direction to Patna High Court CR. APP
(DB) No.484 of 2013 dt. 27-03-2019 surrender forthwith, failing which, the learned court below may
take appropriate steps for securing his attendance for serving the sentence.
22. Similarly, the court below may take appropriate steps for realization of fine from the legal heir of
deceased convict
- appellant /Mundrika Singh.
