[5] After the issuance of the NIT dated 10-02-2020 and before issuing the work orders dated
12-06-2020, the Government of India imposed total lockdown in the whole country due to the
pandemic of Covid-19 from the later part of March, 2020. Even after partial lifting of the total
lockdown imposed by the Government of India, the State Government continued to impose total
lockdown in the whole state to contain the pandemic of Covid-19 and to safeguard the health and
lives of the citizens. It is also the case of the petitioner that the premises of all the three EMRSs' at
Tamenglong, Sapermaina and Moreh were utilized as quarantine centers from the month of May,
2020 as per the orders of the concerned District Magistrate and only after the issuance of the order
dated 02-11- 2021, the Government stopped utilizing the said three school premises as quarantine
centers for covid patients. According to the petitioner, during the period from the month of May,
2020 till the month of November, 2020, the premises of the said three schools were utilized by the
Government as quarantine centers/containment zone and because of the strict restriction imposed
by the Government, movement in and around the premises of the said three schools were strictly
prohibited. Due to the aforesaid situation prevailing in the state of Manipur, the petitioner could not
start execution of the work within the period WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 6 stipulated under
the terms and conditions No. 2 of the work order dated 12-06-2020.
[6] On 30-11-2020, the petitioner submitted a representation to the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal
Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur requesting for giving necessary technical guidance and
selection of work site so as to enable him to start the work and complete the same on time. Instead
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16082832/ 4
Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
of providing necessary technical guidance and selection of work site as requested by the petitioner,
the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, issued an order dated
01-12-2020 cancelling the 10 (ten) work orders issued in favor of the petitioner on the ground that
the petitioner failed to start executing the work within the time stipulated under clause (2) of the
terms and conditions of the work orders. [7] After issuance of the cancellation order dated 01-
12-2020, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, issued an NIT
dated 07-12-2020 in respect of the same works earlier awarded to the petitioner. Having been
aggrieved, the petitioner assailed the cancellation order dated 01-12-2020 and NIT dated
07-12-2020 by filing a writ petition being WP(C) No. 648 of 2020 before this Court. In the said writ
petition, this Court passed an interim order on 15- 12-2020 to the effect that fresh tender process in
respect of the contract work involved in the writ petition should not be finalized without the leave of
the Court. During the pendency of the said writ petition, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs &
Hills, Government of Manipur issued an order dated 13-01-2021 cancelling the earlier cancellation
order dated 01-12-2020 WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 7 impugned in the above mentioned writ
petition. After issuance of the subsequent order dated 31-01-2021, the petitioner submitted a
representation dated 14-01-2021 to the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government
of Manipur requesting to provide technical support, laying/measurement of the work site, to furnish
drawing schedule of quantity and site identification of the said work so as to enable the petitioner to
start the work as soon as possible and for timely execution of the work. On the same day of
submitting the said representation by the petitioner, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs &
Hills, Government of Manipur issued a show cause notice dated 14-01-2021 directing the petitioner
to submit in writing within 7 (seven) days as to why he could not execute the works awarded to him
within the period stipulated under clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work order. In
response to the said show cause notice, the petitioner submitted his reply in writing on 19- 01-2021
explaining in detail the reasons for the inability to commence the works.
[8] The petitioner challenged the said show cause notice dated 14-01-2021 by filing a writ petition
being WP(C) No. 233of 2021 before this Court and during the pendency of the said writ petition, the
Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur issued an order dated
17-03-2021 cancelling the earlier NITs dated 10-02-2020 as well as the subsequent NIT dated
07-12-2020. Having been aggrieved, the petitioner challenged the said cancellation order dated
17-03- 2021 by filing WP(C) No. 868 of 2021 before this Court to redress his grievances. During the
pendency of the aforesaid WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 8 writ petitions, the Executive
Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, issued another order dated 01-12-2021
thereby restoring the earlier NITs dated 10-02-2020. In view of the restoration of the earlier NITs
dated 10-02-2020, this Court disposed of all the pending writ petitions by passing common orders
dated 06-12-2021 and 08-12-2021. In the said common orders, this Court directed the State
respondents to re-schedule the time period that has been prescribed in the work order dated
12-06-2020. The petitioner communicated the orders passed by this Court to the Executive
Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, by submitting a representation dated
27-12-2021 and also requested to allow the petitioner to commence the works and to extend the time
period for completion of the work.

[9] Instead of allowing the petitioner to commence work by re-scheduling the time period
prescribed in the work order, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of
Manipur issued an order dated 29-12-2021 cancelling, for the second time all the earlier work orders
issued in favor of the petitioner. Thereafter, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills,
Government of Manipur issued another three NITs all dated 13-01-2022 in respect of the same work
awarded earlier to the petitioner and without cancelling the first NITs dated 10-02-2020. Having
been aggrieved, the petitioner challenge the said cancellation order dated 29-12-2021 as well as the
new NITs dated 13-01-2022 by filing WP(C) No. 50 of 2022 and other analogous case before this
Court. In the said writ petitions, this Court passed an interim order on 25-01-2022 WP(C)No. 333 of
2022 & Ors Page 9 directing that the impugned NITs shall remain suspended. Subsequently, the
Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs & Hills, Government of Manipur, issued two orders dated
04-03-2022 and 09-03-2022 cancelling the impugned NITs as well as the impugned cancellation
order dated 29-12-2021. In view of the said two orders, all the writ petitions filed by the writ
petitioner challenging the said NITs and the impugned cancellation order were closed as
infructuous.
[10] The State Government filed a batch of writ appeals challenging the common orders dated
06-12-2021, 08-12-2021 and 10-12-2021 passed by the learned Single Judge in the batch of writ
petitions directing the state authorities to re- schedule the time period that was prescribed in the
work order issued in favor of the petitioner. All the writ appeals were disposed of by a common
order dated 28-03-2022 passed in Writ Appeal No. 6 of 2022 and other analogous writ appeals by
setting aside the direction given by the learned Single Judge to re-schedule the time period for
execution of the work pursuant to the work order issued in June, 2020. The Appellate Court further
directed the authorities to consider the reply submitted by the petitioner in response to the show
cause notice dated 14- 01-2021 by giving an opportunity of personal hearing and thereafter, to
decide each case as to whether there was any willful delay or negligence on the part of the contractor
concerned warranting punitive action. The Appellate Court further observed that in the event, no
such lapse is found to be attributable to the contractor concerned, the authorities shall re- schedule
the time period for the execution of works.

[11] In compliance with the directions given by the
Division Bench of this Court in its common order dated 28-03- 2022, the Additional Chief Secretary
(TA & Hills), Government of Manipur, issued an order dated 26-04-2022 cancelling all the work
orders dated 12-06-2022 awarded to the petitioner and also directing to issue fresh tenders and
fresh work orders. Having been aggrieved, the petitioner filed the present writ petitions assailing the
said order dated 26-04-2022 for redressing his grievances.
In the present writ petitions, this Court passed interim order dated 13-05-2022 suspending the
operation of the impugned cancellation order dated 26-04-2022 and directing the authorities not to
take up any action for issuing a fresh NIT in respect of the contract work involved in the writ
petitions with leave of this Court.

Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
[12] During the pendency of the present writ petitions, the Executive Engineer - II, Tribal Affairs &
Hills, Government of Manipur issue three fresh NITs all dated 11-05-2022 in respect of the works
earlier awarded to the petitioner. The said NITs were challenged by the petitioner by filing
miscellaneous applications being MC(WP(C)) No. 163 of 2022 and other analogous applications. In
the said applications, this Court passed an interim order on 23-05-2022 suspending the impugned
NITs dated 11-05-2022.
[13] Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that before issuance of impugned order
dated 26-04- 2022, the work orders awarded to the petitioner were cancelled by the authorities on
two earlier occasions. At the first instance WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 11 of cancellation, the
reason given by the authorities was for non- commencement of the execution of work as per clause
(2) of the terms and conditions of the work order. Subsequently, the authorities revoked the
cancellation order suo moto by issuing another order, which clearly indicated that the reason for
cancellation of the work order was unjustified. At the time of issuing the second cancellation order,
no reason whatsoever was given by the authorities for cancelling the said work orders. Later on, the
second cancellation order was again revoked by the authorities suo moto, thereby clearly indicating
that there was no justifiable reason for cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner. For the
third time, the authorities again cancelled the work orders awarded to the petitioner by issuing the
impugned orders dated 26-04-2022. The only reason given by the authorities for such cancellation
is for breach of clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work orders dated 12-06- 2020.
[14] Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that under clause (2) of the terms and conditions
of the work order, there is no term and condition for cancellation of the work orders if the contractor
breach any of the conditions mentioned therein. Only under clause (3) of the said terms and
conditions, it is provided that if 50% of the work is not executed within the given time of completion
of the work, it will be sufficient ground for cancellation of the work. Learned counsel further
submitted that as the authorities cancelled the work orders dated 12-06-2020 awarded to the
petitioner on -1-12-2020 well before the expiry of the given period for execution of the work, there
was no reason WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 12 whatsoever for cancelling the work orders
awarded to the petitioner. Learned counsel accordingly submitted that the authorities have acted
arbitrarily and unreasonably in issuing the impugned order and such action deserved interference
from this Court by quashing and setting aside the impugned order dated 26-04-2022.
[15] Learned counsel also submitted that as there was no justifiable reason for cancellation of the
work orders awarded to the petitioner and as the authorities have not yet cancelled the earlier NIT
dated 10-02-2020, there was no reason for issuing the impugned NITs dated 11-05-2022 and that
the authorities have issued the impugned NIT without application of mind and accordingly, the
impugned NITs are also liable to be quashed and set aside.
[16] It is also submitted that in spite of the best intention and effort on the part of the petitioner,
work at the allotted sites could not be started because of the prevailing situation in the State due to
the pandemic of Covid-19. After the award of the work order, the petitioner was unable to
commence the work because of several restrictions in entering the work site as the premises of the
three EMRS were declared as containment zone. It is submitted that during the said period,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16082832/ 7
Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
procuring construction materials like cement and steel was almost impossible and as the prices of
whatever little materials available in the market have skyrocketed, it was not feasible to execute the
work under the sanction amount. It has also been submitted that there was also acute shortage of
labour as the labour force was unwilling to work under the prevailing Covid-19 WP(C)No. 333 of
2022 & Ors Page 13 situation and that the Government SOP issued in connection with the Covid-19
pandemic prohibits labour force to work in groups. It has also been submitted that if the authorities
gave a little co-operation, the petitioner could have completed the work within the stipulated time.
[17] Learned counsel also submitted that, the authorities ignored the request of the petitioner to
provide technical guidance and selection of work site etc., which are required to be followed as per
the terms and conditions of the work order before commencing the work and that without
specifically identifying the work site, without providing the specific task to be done and without
providing the technical guidance as to how the task are to be performed, it was not feasible and
practicable for the petitioner to execute the work. It is also submitted that the work orders awarded
to the petitioner have been cancelled without giving any valid and justifiable reason and by ignoring
the reply to the show cause notice as well as the reasons/explanations given therein. Accordingly,
the action of the authorities in cancelling the work orders are arbitrary, bias, unlawful and illegal.
Learned counsel also submitted that the authorities made an unreasonable allegation against the
petitioner in the impugned order that the petitioner failed to start execution of the work despite
lapse of more than 18 (eighteen) months. In this regard, learned counsel for the petitioner
submitted that the reason for non-commencement of the execution of work was due to non-
cooperation of the on the part of the officials of the department in giving technical guidance and
selection of work site as well as the impossibility WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 14 of
commencing the work during the pandemic of Covid-19 and that the authorities never consider this
valid reason at the time of issuing the impugned order.
[18] In the impugned order, the authorities observed that the petitioner executed the work for
upgradation/renovation of "Museum and Amp: Internal Electricity Installation of Tribal Research
Institute (TRI)" under the same department whereas the petitioner failed to execute the present
works. In that regard, it has been submitted that the execution of work at TRI and execution of work
at the three EMRS are not comparable for the following reasons:
i. Unlike the work site at EMRS Tamenglong, the work site at the TRI was not a
Covid-19 quarantine center and as such there was no restriction in visiting the work
site.
ii. There was no restriction in movement around the work site at the TRI.
iii. The work at TRI was executed after the Covid restriction were slightly relaxed.
iv. Unlike in the case of the work at EMRS Tamenglong, selection of work site and
technical guidance were given in the case of the work at the TRI.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16082832/ 8
Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
v. The work site at the TRI is located at the heart of Imphal city, making it easier for
the Petitioner to mobilize labour, raw material and prices of goods.
WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 15
[19] Mr. A. Vashum, learned G.A. appearing for the
respondents, submitted that the petitioner was awarded the contract works for
infrastructure development of EMRS at Tamenglong, Gamnom, Sapermeina and
Moreh by issuing work the orders dated 12.06.2020. As per the terms and conditions
of the contract work, the petitioner was to attend the office of the respondents to
complete the agreement and other formalities within 7 (seven) days from the date of
the issue of the work order. Secondly, the petitioner was to start execution of the
work from 18.06.2020, i.e., 7 (seven) days after the date of issue of the work order.
Thirdly, if the petitioner does not execute 50 percent of the work within the time
allocated for completion of the work, it is sufficient ground for cancellation of the
work order. Fourthly, as soon as the work order was issued, the petitioner was to
contact the Assistant Engineer In-charge of the work immediately and obtain a
necessary technical guidance and selection of work site etc. before the
commencement of the work.
[20] The learned G.A. further submitted that in spite of obtaining the work order
dated 12.06.2020, the petitioner never contacted the Assistant Engineer In-charge of
the work and also did not complete the agreement and other formalities as stipulated
in the terms and conditions of the contract work. It has also been stated that since the
petitioner did not contact the Assistant Engineer In-charge of the work and since the
petitioner did not commence the work within the stipulated time, the authorities
cancelled the work order on 01.12.2020 in terms WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page
16 and conditions under clause (1), (2), (3) & (6) of the terms and conditions of the
work order.
[21] The learned G.A. submitted that the Division Bench of this Court disposed of the
batch of writ appeals filed by the State Government by common order dated
28.03.2022 by setting aside the direction given by the learned Single Judge to
re-schedule the time period for execution of the work. While disposing of the said
batch of writ appeals, the Division Bench also directed the authorities to consider the
reply submitted by the petitioner in response to the show cause notice dated
14.01.2021 by giving an opportunity of personal hearing and thereafter to decide each
individual case as to whether there was any willful delay or negligence on the part of
the contractor warranting punitive action. It has been submitted that in compliance
with the order passed by the learned Division Bench, the authorities heard the
petitioner in person and also considered the reply submitted by him in response to
the show cause notice dated 14.01.2021 and passed the impugned order dated
26.04.2022 thereby cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16082832/ 9
Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
[22] The learned G.A. also submitted that the authorities issued similar work orders to different
contractors for executing the work of water harvesting and solar pumps installation in the same 3
(three) schools, i.e., EMRS at Tamenglong, Gamnom, Sapermeina and Moreh, Tengnoupal during
the same period of Covid pandemic. It has also been submitted that the other contractors
successfully executed the said works within the prescribed period for completion of the works,
whereas the WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 17 petitioner failed to execute the works awarded to
him. It has also been submitted that if the other contractors can execute the work during the period
of Covid Pandemic, the petitioner cannot take the plea that he cannot execute the work awarded to
him because of the pandemic of Covid - 19, which shows that the petitioner does not want to execute
the work.
[23] The learned G.A. vehemently submitted that the claim of the petitioner that the authorities did
not provide necessary technical guidance and selection of work site etc. despite his request is
unacceptable because the petitioner requested the concerned Executive Engineer for providing such
technical support and selection of work site only on 30.11.2020 after a gap of more than 5 (five)
months and accordingly, the authorities cannot accede to the request made by the petitioner. It has
lastly been submitted by the learned G.A. that the authorities have not committed any illegality or
irregularity in issuing the impugned orders and accordingly, the present writ petitions are liable to
be dismissed as being devoid of merit. [24] I have heard the submissions of the learned counsel
appearing for the parties at length and also carefully examined the materials available on record.
It is an undisputed fact that the 10 (ten) work orders dated 12.06.2020 issued in favour of the
petitioner were earlier cancelled twice by the authorities. The first cancelation order was issued on
01.12.21020, just hardly after about 6 (six) months from the date of issue of the work order only on
the ground that the petitioner failed to start execution of the work within the period stipulated
under clause (2) of the terms and WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 18 conditions of the work
order. The second cancellation order was issued on 29.12.2021 without assigning any reason
whatsoever. The authorities subsequently revoked both the cancellation orders suo moto, thereby
indicating that the authorities did not find any justifiable reasons for cancelling the said work
orders. For the third time, the authorities again cancelled the work orders issued in favour of the
petitioner by issuing the impugned order dated 26.04.2022. The reason for the cancellation was that
the petitioner failed to start execution of the works despite the lapse of more than 18 months and the
petitioner had breached the conditions under Clause (2) of the terms and conditions of the work
orders. The authorities were also of the viewed that the reasons given by the petitioner in his written
reply to the show cause for not starting the work has no relevancy inasmuch as the petitioner
executed the work for upgradation/renovation of Museum & Amp: Internal Electric Installation of
Tribal Research Institute (TRI) under the department during the Covid pandemic and that the
petitioner deliberately delayed and neglected in executing the work. [25] On careful examination of
the terms and conditions provided under the work orders, this Court is of the considered view that
Clause (2) does not provide that the starting date of the work is the essence of the contract and that
failure to strict adherence thereto would attract cancellation of the contract. It is only under Clause
(3) where there is condition for cancellation of the work, if 50 percent of the work is not executed
within the allotted time of 12 months. In the present case, the cancellation of the work orders was
not for breach of the condition under WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 19 Clause (3) of the terms

Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
and conditions of the work orders. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the grounds
given by the authorities for cancellation of the works are unreasonable, arbitrary and ultra vires the
terms and conditions provided under the work orders.
[26] With regard to the observations made by the authorities that the petitioner executed the work
for upgradation/renovation of Museum & Amp: Internal Electric Installation at Tribal Research
Institute during the pandemic of Covid - 19 whereas the petitioner failed to execute the work
involved in the present writ petitions, it has been elaborately explained by the petitioner that the
execution of the work at the Tribal Research Institute and the execution of the work at the 3 (three)
EMRS are not comparable for the following reasons:-
i. Unlike the work site at EMRS Tamenglong, the work site at the TRI was not a Covid-19 quarantine
center and as such there was no restriction in visiting the work site.
ii. There was no restriction in movement around the work site at the TRI.
iii. The work at TRI was executed after the Covid restriction were slightly relaxed.
iv. Unlike in the case of the work at EMRS Tamenglong, selection of work site and technical
guidance were given in the case of the work at the TRI.
WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 20
v. The work site at the TRI is located at the
heart of Imphal city, making it easier for the Petitioner to mobilize labour, raw material and prices
of goods.
[27] In the present case before issuance of the first cancellation order dated 01.12.2020, the
petitioner submitted a representation dated 30.11.2020 to the concerned authorities of the
government for providing necessary technical guidance and selection of work site for starting the
contract works, however, instead of providing the necessary technical guidance and selection of
work site, the authorities, in a most arbitrary manner issued the first cancellation order. In fact till
today, the authorities have not provided the necessary technical guidance and selection of work site
to enable the petitioner to start execution of works despite the repeated request made by the
petitioner. In view of this factual aspects, this Court is constrained to hold that the authorities have
acted unreasonably and arbitrarily in accusing the petitioner that he failed to start execution of the
work despite lapses of more than 18 months, when the fault lies with the authorities.
[28] The sequence of events starting from issuance of the first cancellation order leading to the
cancellation of the work orders for the third time on the same invalid and unreasonable ground and
subsequent issuance of the fresh NIT indicates that the authorities do not want the petitioner to
execute the work at any cost. The work orders which have been lawfully awarded to the petitioner
after fulfilling all the legal norms and requirements WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 21 cannot be
cancelled at the whims and fancies of the authorities. There should be a reasonable justification for
the cancellation and absence of any reasonable justification will render the official action unlawful

Ema Ebema Langol Lairembi Construction vs The State Of Manipur on 10 January, 2023
and illegal.
[29] Only in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents, a new ground had been introduced by the
respondents for cancelling the work orders awarded to the petitioner. It had been stated by the
respondents in their counter affidavit that the authorities issued similar work orders to other
contractors for executing the work of Water Harvesting and Solar Pumps Installation in the same 3
(three) EMRS at Tamenglong, Sapermeina and Tengnoupal during the same period of pandemic of
Covid - 19 and that the other contractors successfully executed the said works within the prescribed
period for completion of the works, whereas the petitioner failed to execute the work awarded to
him. It has also been stated that if the other contractors can execute the work during the period of
Covid pandemic, the petitioner cannot take the plea that he could not execute the work awarded to
him because of the pandemic of Covid - 19, which shows that the petitioner does not want to execute
the works. These new grounds were never mentioned by the authorities in the impugned order
dated 26.04.2022.
In my considered view, the validity of the impugned order must be judged on the basis of the
reasons mentioned therein and the new grounds introduced by the respondents in their counter
affidavit cannot be entertained while judging the validity of the impugned order. In this regard, we
can gainfully WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 22 rely to the principle of law laid down by a
constitution bench of 5 (five) Judges of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mohinder Singh Gill &
Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New Delhi & Ors. reported in (1978) 1 SCC 405 wherein
it is laid down as under:-
"8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a statutory functionary makes an
order based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so
mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or
otherwise. Otherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes to
Court on account of a challenge, get validated by additional grounds later brought
out. We may here draw attention to the observations of Bose, J. In Gordhandas
Bhanji:
Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed
in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of
what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do. Public orders
made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect
the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed
objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself.
Orders are not like old wine becoming better as they grow older."
[30] For the findings and reasons given hereinabove, the present writ petitions are allowed by
quashing the impugned order dated 26.04.2022 and the impugned NITs dated 11.05.2022. The
respondents are further directed to allow the petitioner to execute the works awarded to him under
the work WP(C)No. 333 of 2022 & Ors Page 23 orders dated 12.06.2020 by rescheduling the time

period for execution of such works as expeditiously as possible.
With the aforesaid directions, the present writ petitions are disposed of. Parties are to bear their
own cost.
