THESE MFAs COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY,
P.S.DINESH KUMAR J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
JUDGMENT
These two appeals are presented by the claimants challenging the judgment and award dated April
18, 2015, in MVCs.No.1123 & 1124 of 2014 passed by the Motor Vehicles Accident Claims Tribunal &
II Additional Small Causes Judge & XXVIII ACMM, Bengaluru.
2. MFA No.8329/2015 is filed by the legal heirs of deceased Smt.Sangeetha. MFA No.8330/2015 is
filed by Sangeetha's husband claiming enhancement of compensation for the loss of foetus.

Sri. Kumar @ Venkatesh vs M/S Iffco Tokkio on 6 January, 2022
3. For the sake of convenience, parties shall be referred as per their status before the Tribunal.
4. Heard Shri Vasanthappa, learned advocate for claimants-appellants and Shri H.N.Keshava
Prashanth, learned advocate for first respondent-Insurer.
5. In MFA No.8329/2015, pregnant wife of first claimant's Smt.Sangeetha sustained grievous
injuries in a road traffic accident on 19.02.2014, when a bus bearing Registration No.KA-01-D-4396
coming from opposite side dashed against her. Smt.Sangeetha succumbed to the injuries in the
hospital. On adjudication of the claim petition, Tribunal has awarded Rs.14,59,900/- in
MVC.No.1123/2014 and Rs.2,50,000/- in MVC.No.1124/2014 with interest at 6% from the date of
petition till the date of deposit.
6. Shri Vasanthappa for the claimants submitted that deceased was working as housemaid and
earning Rs.10,000/- per month. Learned Tribunal has erred in considering the income of the
deceased as Rs.7,000/- per month, and accordingly sought for enhancement.
7. He further submitted that the Tribunal has erroneously absolved the insurer from indemnifying
the owner of the vehicle on the ground that the offending vehicle, the bus had no permit to ply on
the route, where accident has occurred. He submitted that in view of law laid down in Amrit Paul
Singh & Another Vs. Tata AIG General Insurance Company Limited1, insurer is liable to satisfy the
award with liberty to recover from the owner of the bus.
8. Shri.H.N.Keshava Prashanth, learned advocate for the insurer, in his usual fairness, does not
dispute this position of law.
9. We have carefully considered the submissions of learned advocates on both sides and perused the
records.
10. Claimants have not produced any document before the Tribunal to substantiate their claim that
Smt.Sangeetha was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. In the absence of any proof of income, this
Court has consistently considered the notional income of an able bodied person in the year 2014 as
Rs.8,500/- p.m.
11. Deceased was aged 34 years, hence the applicable multiplier is 16 and future prospects is to be
added at 40%.
12. First claimant is the husband, claimants No.2 to 4 are minor children of the deceased. Hence,
1/4th is deductible from the earnings of the deceased while calculating loss of dependency.
13. Thus, compensation towards loss of dependency is worked out as follows;
The monthly notional income works out to Rs.11,900/- (Rs.8,500+3,400) [by adding 40% towards
future prospects (Rs.8,500*40%=Rs.3,400)]. After deducting 1/4th, it works out to Rs.8,925/- per
month (Rs.11,900*3/4). The Annual notional income works out to Rs.1,07,100/- (Rs.8,925*12). By
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/115440378/ 4
Sri. Kumar @ Venkatesh vs M/S Iffco Tokkio on 6 January, 2022
applying 16 as multiplier, the loss of dependency works out to Rs.17,13,600/- (Rs.1,07,100*16).
14. Total compensation is re-computed as follows;
Sl. Description Amount
No.
a. Loss of dependency
Rs.17,13,600
b. ADD:Consortium
(Rs.40,000*4) Rs.1,60,000
c. ADD:Conventional
heads;funeral Rs.30,000
expenses, etc.,
d. Total (a+b+c) Rs.19,03,600
e. LESS: Compensation Rs.14,59,900
awarded by the
Tribunal
Enhanced Compensation (d-e) Rs.4,43,700
15. Following the law laid down in Amrit Paul Singh (supra), we hold that the insurer is liable to
indemnify the owner of the vehicle with liberty to pay and recover by executing the decree in these
proceedings.
16. In MFA No.8330/2015, the claimant is Sangeetha's husband. He has sought enhancement of
compensation for loss of foetus. The Tribunal has awarded Rs.2,50,000/-. In New India Assurance
Co.Ltd. Vs. Satender and Others2, the Apex Court has held that a sum of Rs.1,80,000/- is payable as
compensation for loss of foetus. Since Tribunal has already awarded more than the said sum, no
interference is required in this appeal.
17. Hence, the following;
ORDER
(i) MFA No.8329/2015 is allowed in part by holding that claimants are entitled for a total
compensation of Rs.19,03,600/-, as against Rs.14,59,900/- awarded by the Tribunal, payable with
interest at 6% p.a., (2006) 13 SCC 60 PARA 13 from the date of filing claim petition till the date of
deposit. The enhanced compensation is Rs.4,43,700/-;
(ii) Insurer shall pay the entire compensation amount of Rs.19,03,600/- with interest at 6% p.a.,
excluding the amount paid, if any, within eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order
and recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. Disbursement shall be made as directed by the
