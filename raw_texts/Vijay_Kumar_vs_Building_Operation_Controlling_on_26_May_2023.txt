ORDER
26.05.2023 The present writ petition is coming up to question a judgment dated 10.05.2023 by the
Jammu & Kashmir Special Tribunal, Jammu passed on file no. JKSTJ/829/2009 while disposing of
an appeal filed way back in the November, 2009.
Thus, it is obvious that the construction in reference is dating back to 2009. The disposal of the
appeal under the Control of Building Operation Act, 1988 came to consume time because of disposal
of the matter in the first round which came to be questioned before this Court whereupon remand
came to take place and the impugned order is the one passed in the remand proceedings.
Prima facie case is made out.
Issue notice to the respondents.
