Hon'ble Sanjay Kumar Pachori,J.
1. The present application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has been filed
to quash the entire proceedings of Criminal Case No. 1885 of 2021 (State vs. Akash Nigam and
others), arising out of Case Crime No. 383 of 2021, under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506 I.P.C. and
section 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, P.S. Kareli, District- Prayagraj, as well as
cognizance/summoning order dated 10.5.2021, pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate,
court no. 4, Prayagraj.
2. Brief facts of the case on the basis of First Information Report dated 10.5.2021 are that the
marriage of opposite party no. 2 was solemnized with applicant no. 4 Akash Nigam as per Hindu
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123496024/ 1

rites and rituals and after sometime due to some personal reasons the relation between the couple
became worse from bad and in the lack of marital harmony the relation became distressful.
Thereafter due to intervention of some senior and civilized citizen of the society both applicant no. 4
and opposite party no. 2 agreed to dissolve their marriage and decided to live separately. The
applicant no. 4 has given Rs. 35,00,000/- (Rs. thirty five lacs only) to opposite party no. 2 as
permanent alimony through Bank Draft No. 645267, dated 20.1.2022 issued by State Bank of India,
Gomti Nagar Branch. The applicant no. 4 and opposite party no. 2 have resolved to put an end to
their dispute and greed to file a mutual divorce petition under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage
Act, 1955.
3. Learned counsel for the parties has submitted that both the parties have settled their matrimonial
dispute amicably by way of mutual divorce under Section 13(B) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in
which a decree of mutual divorce has been passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,
Family Court, Court no. 2, Allahabad on 24.08.2022. It is further submitted that all the disputes
between the parties have been settled and decree of divorce has been filed a Annexure-SA1 to the
supplementary affidavit dated 23.09.2022.
4. In view of the fact that the applicants and opposite party no. 2 do not want to pursue the case any
further as stated by them. The matter has been mutually settled between the parties, therefore, no
useful purpose would be served in proceeding with the matter further.
5. Learned A.G.A. as well as learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 supported the decision and
reasoning adopted by the trial court.
6. Heard Sri Chandra Shekhar Agnihotri, learned counsel for the applicants, Sri Saurabh Srivastava,
learned counsel for the private opposite party no. 2 and Smt. Ladli Pandey, learned A.G.A. for the
State and perused the material on record.
7. Before considering the rival submissions of the parties, it is apposite to consider the settled
position of law.
8. In Geeta Mehrotra & Another Vs. State of U.P. & Another 2012 (10) SCC 741, the Supreme Court
observed after dealing the misuse of provision of Section 498-A of I.P.C. against the relatives of the
husband in paragraph no. 20, which is extracted below:
"20. It would be relevant at this stage to take note of an apt observation of this Court
recorded in the matter of G.V. Rao vs. L.H.V. Prasad & Ors. reported (2000) 3 SCC
693 wherein also in a matrimonial dispute, this Court had held that the High Court
should have quashed the complaint arising out of a matrimonial dispute wherein all
family members had been roped into the matrimonial litigation which was quashed
and set aside. Their Lordships observed therein with which we entirely agree that:
"there has been an outburst of matrimonial dispute in recent times. Marriage is a
sacred ceremony, main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down

Ashok Kumar Nigam And 3 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 31 January, 2025
in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly erupt which
often assume serious proportions resulting in heinous crimes in which elders of the
family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and
brought about rapprochement are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as
accused in the criminal case. There are many reasons which need not be mentioned
here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over
their defaults and terminate the disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of
fighting it out in a court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that
process the parties lose their "young" days in chasing their cases in different courts."
The view taken by the judges in this matter was that the courts would not encourage
such disputes.
21. In yet another case reported in the matter of B.S. Joshi & Ors. vs. State of
Haryana & Anr. AIR 2003 SC 1386, it was observed that there is no doubt that the
object of introducing Chapter XXA containing Section 498A in the Indian Penal Code
was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband or by relatives of her husband.
Section 498A was added with a view to punish the husband and his relatives who
harass or torture the wife to coerce her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of
dowry. But if the proceedings are initiated by the wife under Section 498A against the
husband and his relatives and subsequently she has settled her disputes with her
husband and his relatives and the wife and husband agreed for mutual divorce,
refusal to exercise inherent powers by the High Court would not be proper as it would
prevent woman from settling earlier.
Thus for the purpose of securing the ends of justice quashing of FIR becomes
necessary, Section 320 Cr.P.C. would not be a bar to the exercise of power of
quashing. It would however be a different matter depending upon the facts and
circumstances of each case whether to exercise or not to exercise such a power."
9. In Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam Vs. State of Bihar 2022 0 Supreme (SC) 117, the Supreme Court
observed after referring the catena of the judgement in paragraph no. 13, which is extracted below:
"13. This Court in its judgment in Rajesh Sharma and Others vs. State of U.P. and
Another, (2018) 10 SCC 472, has observed:-
"14. Section 498-A was inserted in the statute with the laudable object of punishing
cruelty at the hands of husband or his relatives against a wife particularly when such
cruelty had potential to result in suicide or murder of a woman as mentioned in the
statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act 46 of 1983. The expression 'cruelty' in
section 498-A covers conduct which may drive the woman to commit suicide or cause
grave injury (mental or physical) or danger to life or harassment with a view to coerce
her to meet unlawful demand. It is a matter of serious concern that large number of
cases continue to be filed under already referred to some of the statistics from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123496024/ 3
Ashok Kumar Nigam And 3 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 31 January, 2025
Crime Records Bureau. This Court had earlier noticed the fact that most of such
complaints are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues. Many of such
complaints are not bona-fide. At the time of filing of the complaint, implications and
consequences are not visualized. At times such complaints lead to uncalled for
harassment not only to the accused but also to the complainant. Uncalled for arrest
may ruin the chances of settlement."
14. Previously, in the landmark judgment of this court in Arnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar and
Another, (2014) 8 SCC 273 it was also observed:-
"4. There is a phenomenal increase in matrimonial disputes in recent years. The
institution of marriage is greatly revered in this country. Section 498-A IPC was
introduced with avowed object to combat the menace of harassment to a woman at
the hands of her husband and his relatives. The fact that Section 498-A IPC is a
cognizable and non-bailable offence has lent it a dubious place of pride amongst the
provisions that are used as weapons rather than shield by disgruntled wives. The
simplest way to harass is to get the husband and his relatives arrested under this
provision. In a quite number of cases, bed-ridden grandfathers and grand-mothers of
the husbands, their sisters living abroad for decades are arrested."
15. Further in Preeti Gupta & Anr. Vs. State of Jharkhand & Another, (2010) 7 SCC 667 it has also
been observed:-
"32. It is a matter of common experience that most of these complaints under section
498-A IPC are filed in the heat of the moment over trivial issues without proper
deliberations. We come across a large number of such complaints which are not even
bona-fide and are filed with oblique motive. At the same time, rapid increase in the
number of genuine cases of dowry harassment are also a matter of serious concern.
33. The learned members of the Bar have enormous social responsibility and
obligation to ensure that the social fiber of family life is not ruined or demolished.
They must ensure that exaggerated versions of small incidents should not be reflected
in the criminal complaints. Majority of the complaints are filed either on their advice
or with their concurrence. The learned members of the Bar who belong to a noble
profession must maintain its noble traditions and should treat every complaint under
section 498-A as a basic human problem and must make serious endeavour to help
the parties in arriving at an amicable resolution of that human problem. They must
discharge their duties to the best of their abilities to ensure that social fiber, peace
and tranquility of the society remains intact. The members of the Bar should also
ensure that one complaint should not lead to multiple cases.
34. Unfortunately, at the time of filing of the complaint the implications and
consequences are not properly visualized by the complainant that such complaint can
lead to insurmountable harassment, agony and pain to the complainant, accused and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123496024/ 4
Ashok Kumar Nigam And 3 Others vs State Of U.P. And Another on 31 January, 2025
his close relations.
35. The ultimate object of justice is to find out the truth and punish the guilty and
protect the innocent. To find out the truth is a herculean task in majority of these
complaints. The tendency of implicating husband and all his immediate relations is
also not uncommon. At times, even after the conclusion of criminal trial, it is difficult
to ascertain the real truth. The courts have to be extremely careful and cautious in
dealing with these complaints and must take pragmatic realities into consideration
while dealing with matrimonial cases. The allegations of harassment of husband's
close relations who had been living in different cities and never visited or rarely
visited the place where the complainant resided would have an entirely different
complexion. The allegations of the complaint are required to be scrutinized with great
care and circumspection.
36. Experience reveals that long and protracted criminal trials lead to rancour,
acrimony and bitterness in the relationship amongst the parties. It is also a matter of
common knowledge that in cases filed by the complainant if the husband or the
husband's relations had to remain in jail even for a few days, it would ruin the
chances of amicable settlement altogether. The process of suffering is extremely long
and painful."
17. Recently, in K. Subba Rao vs. State of Telangana, (2018) 14 SCC 452, it was also observed that:-
"6. The Courts should be careful in proceeding against the distant relatives in crimes
pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths. The relatives of the husband
should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations unless specific instances of
their involvement in the crime are made out."
10. As per prosecution case there are allegations;
(i) Firstly; the demand of additional dowry was arose in the year of 2023, when the applicant no. 1
got appointed as a teacher (after about 10 years of the marriage). No specific date has been
mentioned in the F.I.R. with regard to incident of demand of additional dowry.
(ii) Secondly; as per allegations of the F.I.R., on 18.12.2021 at about 05:00 P.M., the applicants
committed marpeet with the first informant with lathi and danda and tried to pour the kerosene oil
upon the first informant but there is no medical report of any injured person. The F.I.R. has been
lodged after about 5 months of the incident. There is general allegation of committing marpeet.
(iii) Thirdly; on 22.12.2021 at 02:00 P.M. her husband forcibly make sign of the first informant on a
stamp paper, this allegation is related to applicant no. 1.
(iv) Fourthly; on 22.02.2022 at about 07:00 a.m. the applicants attacked her with intent to kill and
assaulted him and drove her out of their house. There is no pre-summoning evidence in any of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123496024/ 5

medical reports to substantiate the allegations.
(v) Fifthly; the applicant no. 1 solemnized second marriage with applicant no. 4 without any decree
of divorce. There is no pre-summoning evidence with regard to solemnization of the marriage by the
applicant no. 4, which is also against applicant no. 1.
11. The applicant nos. 2 and 3 are father-in-law and mother-in-law of the opposite party no. 2 and
the applicant no. 4 is daughter of one Ram Karan. There is no pre-summoning evidence with regard
to offence punishable under Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506, 406, 494, 120-B, 420 of I.P.C. and no
case is made out against the applicant nos. 2 to 4 in the aforesaid offences. The first information
report has been lodged after about 5 months of the incident which took place on 18.12.2021 and
there is no medical report and no specific role or involvement has been attributed to the applicant
nos. 2 to 4. General allegations of committing marpeet has been assigned to the applicants no. 2 to 4
and other allegations are related to applicant no. 1.
12. In view of the above facts and circumstances, keeping in mind the settled position of law in Geeta
Mehrotra (supra) and Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam (supra), I am of the considered opinion that all
the ingredients of Sections 498-A, 323, 504, 506, 406, 494, 120-B, 420 of I.P.C. and 3/4 of D.P. Act,
are made out.
13. Thus, in view of the well settled principles of law as laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court
reported in Geeta Mehrotra (supra) and Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam (supra), the proceedings of
the Criminal Case along-with cognizance order dated 10.05.2021 in Case No. 1885 of 2021 (State vs.
Akash Nigam and others), arising out of Case Crime No. 383 of 2021, under Sections 498A, 323,
504, 506 I.P.C. and section 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, P.S. Kareli, District- Prayagraj are hereby set
aside.
14. The present application is, accordingly, allowed.
