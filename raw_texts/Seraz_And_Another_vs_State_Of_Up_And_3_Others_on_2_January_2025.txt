3. Learned A.G.A., on instructions, states that the police authorities in compliance of the directions
issued by this Court in Criminal Misc. Bail Application No. 46998 of 2020 (Junaid Vs State of U.P.
and another) reported at 2021 (6) ADJ 511 and with a view to implement the provisions of POCSO
Act, 2012 read with POCSO Rules, 2020, have served the bail application upon the informant/victim
as well as upon the CWC.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that petitioners have no complicity in the instant
case. The whole prosecution story is totally false, frivolous and no case is made out under Section
376(2) IPC precisely on the ground that victim has already recorded her statement under Section
180 and 183 BNSS, which is also appended alongwith record, wherein, it is reflected that second
petitioner has never outraged the modesty of the victim. He submits that no role is assigned to the
first petitioner under Section 376(2) IPC or Section 5/6 and 7/8 of Prevention of Children From
Sexual Offences Act.
5. Considering the facts and circumstances, we are not inclined to keep the matter pending
consideration. The writ petition is disposed of with observation that the Investigating Officer may
proceed in accordance with law and finalize the proceeding but certainly after taking into account
the statement under Section 180 and 183 BNSS. For the period of two months, the respondents are
restrained from arresting the petitioners pursuant to impugned FIR, subject to co-operation in the
on-going investigation.
