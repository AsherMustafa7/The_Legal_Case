JUSTICE BISWANATH RATH
ORDER
01.10.2021 Order No.
01. 1. For the decision of this Court already taken today in W.P.(C) No.23312 of 2020 along with two
other writ petitions observing that there is mechanical disposal of the matter through the impugned
order, more particularly keeping in view the observation made therein that the decision of the
District Education Officer rested on an unavailable Resolution and in non-application of the settled
position of law through the decision covering the case of the Petitioner(s) already at hand, further
keeping in view the request of the learned Senior Standing Counsel that the Department wants to
withdraw the impugned order therein for their own realization that there is not only wrong
application of unavailable resolution but there is also no consideration of settled position of law, the
impugned order involved herein is permitted to be withdrawn. The // 2 // observation made and
direction issued in W.P.(C) No.23312 of 2020 along with two other writ petitions, since squarely
covers the case at hand, are required to be followed.
2. The writ petition succeeds, but as there is requirement for reconsideration of the issues, the
matter is remitted to the Commissioner-cum-Secretary, School & Mass Education Department
together with the Director of Secondary Education to consider the request of the Petitioner(s)
strictly in terms of the direction contained in W.P.(C) No.23312 of 2020 along with two other writ

petitions disposed of by this Court in today's order and also the decisions referred to therein and by
considering all the issues in a common decision.
3. In order to avoid any further delay, learned Standing Counsel for the School & Mass Education
Department is directed to communicate this order to the Commissioner-cum- Secretary, School &
Mass Education Department and the Director of Secondary Education along with copy of the order
dated 28.09.2021 passed in W.P.(C) No.23312 of 2020 for their doing the needful wit hin two
months from such communication.
4. The writ petition thus stands disposed of.
