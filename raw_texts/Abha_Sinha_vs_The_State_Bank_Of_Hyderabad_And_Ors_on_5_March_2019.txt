Heard Sri Birmani Kumar, learned counsel for the
appellant and Sri Anjani Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the

learned Single Judge has met the same fate. The impugned
judgment dated 27.11.2017 of the learned Single Judge records
that since the appellant has received an ex-gratia amount of
Rs.12,00,000/-, then a claim of compassionate appointment is an
after thought, and the same cannot be availed of through the
extra-ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution
of India.
Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the
appellant had a right to be considered for compassionate
appointment keeping in view the scheme which was applicable
as on the date of the death of the appellant's husband. The
appellant's husband died on 13th of December, 2014 while
working in the Bank. The Scheme which was applicable prior to
2014 is reflected in the Circular dated 30th August, 2011 which
is extracted hereinunder:-

Abha Sinha vs The State Bank Of Hyderabad And Ors on 5 March, 2019
The aforesaid Scheme came to be revised in the year 2014 itself and before the death
of the employee. The said revised Scheme of the year 2014 is extracted hereinunder
for ready reference:-
"SCHEME OF COMPASSIONATE APPOINTMENT ON COMPASSIONATE
GROUNDS IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES IN STATE BANK OF HYDERABAD
1. NAME: "SBH Scheme for Compassionate Appointment on Compassionate
Grounds in Exceptional Cases- 2014".
2. BACKGROUND:
In compliance with the directions received from Government of India, Bank
introduced "Scheme for Payment of Ex-gratia lumpsum amount" w.e.f. 12.12.2005 in
lieu of Compassionate Appointments.
Subsequently, Indian Banks' Association came out with another scheme for providing
compassionate appointment in the following exceptional cases and Patna High Court L.P.A No.50 of
2018 dt.05-03-2019 our Bank also adopted the same w.e.f. 12.12.2005 as a parallel scheme for
payment of Ex-gratia lumpsum amount.
a) Where an employee died while performing official duty, as a result of violence,
terrorism, robbery or dacoity; or
b) Where an employee died within five years of first appointment or before reaching
the age of 30 years, whichever is later, leaving a dependent spouse and/or minor
children.
3. OBJECTIVE OF THE NEW SCHEME-2014 In subsequent developments, GOI has advised that all
Public Sector Banks can have both the options i.e. compassionate appointment or payment of
ex-gratia lumpsum amount. Accordingly, the Bank has decided to continue the scheme for
compassionate appointment in exceptional circumstances with certain modifications in terms and
conditions. The whole object of offering compassionate employment in such exceptional cases is to
enable the family to tide over the sudden crisis due to death of bread winner. The mere death of an
employee in harness does not entitle his family to such a source of livelihood. The object is to offer
compassionate appointment only when the Bank is satisfied that the financial condition of the
family is such that but for the provision of employment the family will not be able to meet the crisis.
4. DEFINITIONS:
Unless the context otherwise requires in the Scheme. i. "Bank" mean- State Bank of
Hyderabad ii. "Board" means- Board of Directors or the Executive Committee of the
Board of Directors of State Bank of Hyderabad.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99280988/ 4
Abha Sinha vs The State Bank Of Hyderabad And Ors on 5 March, 2019
iii. "Managing Director" of the Bank means- the Patna High Court L.P.A No.50 of
2018 dt.05-03-2019 Managing Director of the State Bank of Hyderabad." A perusal of
Clause 3 of the revised Scheme would indicate that apart from payment of ex-gratia
lump sum amount a claim of compassionate appointment can also be considered.
The learned Single Judge has nowhere referred to the existence of such Scheme and
its applicability nor has the Bank while passing the order dated 30th July, 2015 taken
into consideration the exceptional circumstances in which the appellant, who is a
young widow, had claimed compassionate appointment.
The right to claim compassionate appointment arises out of the Scheme of the
respondent-Bank itself. As to what is a right has been described by the Apex Court in
the case of Mr. 'X' Versus Hospital 'Z', reported in (1998) 8 SCC 296, paragraph 15,
which is extracted hereinunder:-
15. "Right" is an interest recognised and protected by moral or legal rules. It is an
interest the violation of which would be a legal wrong. Respect for such interest
would be a legal duty. That is how Salmond has defined "right". In order, therefore,
that an interest becomes the subject of a legal right, it has to have not merely legal
protection but also legal recognition. The elements of a "legal right" are that the
"right" is vested in a person and is available against a person who is under a
corresponding obligation and duty to respect that right and has to act or forbear from
acting in a manner so as to prevent Patna High Court L.P.A No.50 of 2018
dt.05-03-2019 the violation of the right. If, therefore, there is a legal right vested in a
person, the latter can seek its protection against a person who is bound by a
corresponding duty not to violate that right."
The right to be considered for compassionate appointment, therefore, is available to the appellant
and hence the corresponding obligation does exist on the Bank to consider the said request of the
appellant in accordance with the Scheme which is applicable. We do not find the Bank to have
applied its mind to the circumstances which the appellant claims to be exceptional for extension of
such benefit apart from the payment of ex-gratia which she has received. The learned Single Judge
has treated the receipt of ex-gratia payment in a lump sum manner to be a final settlement by the
appellant and has proceeded to dismiss the writ petition.
We are unable to agree with the aforesaid conclusion drawn for the reasons already stated above.
Consequently, the impugned judgement dated 27.11.2017 and the order of the Bank dated 30th July,
2015 are set aside with a direction to the concerned competent authority to proceed to consider the
claim of the appellant in the light of the observations made hereinabove and the Scheme which may
be applicable for grant of compassionate appointment or Patna High Court L.P.A No.50 of 2018
dt.05-03-2019 otherwise within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of the order before the said authority.
The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
