The petitioners have agreed to pay settled amount of Rs.4.50 lac and an amount of Rs.1.50 lac was
deposited in the account of Sapna Kumar (OP No.2) in her account no.35533875740 and
subsequently issued a cheque for a sum of Rs.3 lac on 24.01.2025, which has incorrectly been
mentioned as 24.12.2025 by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners. On these
grounds, the learned counsel submitted that in the interest of justice, he seeks quashing the entire
proceeding.
4. Learned APP for the State has vehemently opposed the prayer of the petitioners. He has drawn
attention of the Court that there are calls transfer in respect of Rs.1.50 lac between the parties and a
cheque for Rs.3 lac was handed over to OP No.2 on 24.01.2025 but it is not clear as to whether the
said amount was credited into her account.
5. Heard the parties.
Patna High Court CR. MISC. No.27654 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025
6. The Apex Court has deprecated that the matrimonial litigation should not be encouraged and
opportunity be given to the parties to ponder over their default and terminate their disputes
amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law. The principle of law is laid
down by the Apex Court in the case of B.S. Joshi v. State of Haryana, reported in (2003) 4 SCC 675,
wherein the Apex Court in Paragraph Nos. 12 and 13 has held as under:-
" 12. The special features in such matrimonial matters are evident. It becomes the
duty of the court to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes.
13. The observations made by this Court, though in a slightly different context, in
G.V. Rao v. L.H.V. Prasad [(2000) 3 SCC 693 : 2000 SCC (Cri) 733] are very apt for
determining the approach required to be kept in view in a matrimonial dispute by the
courts. It was said that there has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent
times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the
young couple to settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial
skirmishes suddenly erupt which often assume serious proportions resulting in
commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the
result that those who could have counselled and brought about rapprochement are
rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case. There are
many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not encouraging
matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their defaults and
terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a
court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and in that process the parties
lose their "young"
days in chasing their "cases" in different courts."

7. In the present case, the parties have entered into one time settlement. A sum of Rs.4.50 lacs is the
agreed amount between the parties, which the petitioners are liable to pay to the Patna High Court
CR. MISC. No.27654 of 2025 dt.26-09-2025 O.P. No.2, out of which, the petitioners have paid
through bank transactions a sum of Rs.1.50 lacs to the O.P. no.2 and for the remaining amount of
Rs.3 lacs, they have issued a cheque in the name of Sapna Kumari (O.P. No.2) of the Bharat
Cooperative Bank, Mumbai Ltd. There is no information, as to whether, the cheque amount has
been credited into the account of O.P. No.2.
8. In such circumstances, I find it proper to direct the learned district court concerned to verify from
the O.P. No.2 regarding payment of reaming amount of Rs.3 lacs. In case, the O.P. No.2 informs that
she has received the entire amount, then in that case, it is the duty of the learned District Court to
drop the entire proceedings against the petitioners.
9. The present quashing application is accordingly allowed.
