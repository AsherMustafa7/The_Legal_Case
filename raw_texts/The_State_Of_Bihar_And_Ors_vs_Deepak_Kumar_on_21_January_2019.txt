ORAL JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE) Date : 21-01-2019 I.A. No. 4169 of 2018 Having heard
the learned Advocate General as well as the learned counsel for the respondent-petitioner, we find
sufficient cause having been shown to condone the delay in filing of the appeal.
The delay condonation application is allowed and the delay in filing of the appeal is condoned. The
appeal shall be treated to be within time.
Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018 dt.21-01-2019 Heard learned Advocate General for the
appellant-State and Sri Pramod Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the respondent- petitioner.
At the very outset, we may point out that against the same very impugned judgement, L.P.A. No. 459
of 2018 (State of Bihar and others vs. Manish Kumar) has been filed and is connected with this
appeal where, upon a consideration of the materials on record, a Division Bench on 2nd August,
2018 stayed the operation of the impugned judgement and order of the learned Single Judge.
In the wake of the aforesaid interim order and in the background of the grounds raised, this Court
was also pleased to issue notices upon which learned counsel has appeared and resisted this appeal.

Learned Advocate General, Sri Lalit Kishore, while advancing his submissions has laid emphasis on
the finding recorded by the learned Single Judge while interpreting the provisions of Section
14(1)(b)(i)(3) of the Arms Act, 1959, where the learned Single Judge has held that since the aforesaid
section does not incorporate within itself the ground of imminent danger or actual threat perception
as a ground of refusal, therefore, a licensing authority cannot refuse to grant a license on such a
Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018 dt.21-01-2019 ground declaring the person to be unfit.
Learned Advocate General has taken exception to this interpretation contending that this universal
direction, as contained in the judgment, is trenching upon the discretion to be exercised by the
licensing authority who can, after examining the police report and such other materials that may be
available before him, proceed to refuse to grant license inasmuch as the grant of the permission to
possess a fire arms license does not partake the nature of a fundamental right inasmuch as a person
does not have any such right of carrying fire arms. He submits that since the law is regulated under
the Arms Act, 1959, in that view of the matter, the interpretation given by the learned Single Judge
would impinge upon the power to be exercised by the licensing authority while making an
assessment with regard to the genuineness of a request for grant of a license. The contention,
therefore, is that the omnibus declaration made by the learned Single Judge takes away the
discretionary power vested in the licensing authority as conferred by the statute by reading into it
such words which necessarily take away the discretion of the licensing authority to refuse a license
even if an applicant has been unable to place any material on record to justify the grant of such
license. He, however, contends that the genuineness or otherwise of the purpose of license, if it
exists, the Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018 dt.21-01-2019 same has to be taken into
consideration for grant of a license and, for that, the licensing authority will have to take into
consideration the materials on record, including the police report as also the purpose for which the
license has been sought by the applicant.
As noted above, a Division Bench of this Court had stayed the operation of the judgement and order
impugned herein. It appears that after the judgement was delivered by the learned Single Judge on
11th August, 2015, the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred under the 1959 Act
and in supersession of the Arms Rules, 1962 promulgated the Arms Rules, 2016 that came to be
published in the gazette on 15 th July, 2016.
Learned counsel for the respondent-petitioner would submit that the learned Single Judge has not
committed any error inasmuch as the Rules of 2016 came later on and as on the date when the
judgement was delivered, the learned Single Judge was fully justified in observing that a refusal to
grant a license so as to declare a person unfit cannot be on the ground of a complete lack of threat
perception or imminent danger. He submits that the learned Single Judge was, therefore, justified in
arriving at the conclusion that such a ground for declaring the applicant unfit being not
decipherable in Section 14 of the 1959 Act, the licensing Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018
dt.21-01-2019 authority cannot proceed to carve out this ground for the purpose of refusal of license.
We have considered the submissions raised and in the background aforesaid and with the
promulgation of Arms Rules, 2016, what we find is that the Rules that have been enforced now take
care of the guidelines which are to be followed by the licensing authority as an obligation while
proceeding to consider the grant or refusal of a license. We may gainfully reproduce Rule 12 of 2016
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113182084/ 2
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Deepak Kumar on 21 January, 2019
Rules along with Sub Rule (1) and Sub Rule (3) thereof which are relevant for the purpose of present
controversy as the present set of appeals relate to grant of license for permissible arms and
ammunition specified in Category-3 of Schedule-1 of the said Rules. The same is reproduced
hereinunder :
"12. Obligations of licensing authority in certain cases. ─ (1) Save as otherwise
provided in the Act, every licensing authority granting a licence in Form III to an
individual for the restricted or permissible arms or ammunition as specified in
category I(b) and I(c) or category III respectively in Schedule I, shall have due regard
to the application of norms specified in sub-rules (2) and (3).
(3) For grant of a licence for the permissible arms or ammunition specified in
category III in Schedule I, and without prejudice to the provisions contained in clause
(a) of sub-section (3) of section 13, the licensing authority, based on the police report
and on his own assessment, may consider the applications of ─
(a) any person who by the very nature of his business, profession, job or otherwise
has genuine requirement to protect his life and/or property; or
(b) any dedicated sports person being active member for the last two years, of a
shooting club or a rifle association, Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018
dt.21-01-2019 licensed under these rules and who wants to pursue sport shooting for
target practice in a structured learning process; or
(c) any person in service or having served in the Defence Forces, Central Armed
Police Forces or the State Police Force and has genuine requirement to protect his life
and/or property."
In addition thereto, the third Schedule along with the relevant proforma meant for grant and
renewal of such licenses also indicates that apart from the normal conditions as prescribed under
the Act and Rules, the conditions mentioned in the said forms have to be fulfilled. A perusal thereof
would indicate that it also requires the applicant to clearly mention the purpose for which the
license is required.
This is clearly in consonance with Sub-Rule (3)(a) of Rule 12 extracted hereinabove, where the very
purpose of the acquisition of arms has to be assessed by the licensing authority on the basis of a
police report or on his own assessment. This, therefore, leaves no room for doubt that there is an
obligation cast on the licensing authority now to consider these elements as referred to in the
aforesaid Rules for either granting or refusing to grant a license and for that the police report and
the own assessment of the licensing authority in terms thereof has to be guided in accordance with
the 2016 Rules. It appears that the Rule making authority was aware of such situations that would
require an assessment by the officer and, so far as the present case is Patna High Court LPA No.758
of 2018 dt.21-01-2019 concerned, the respondent-petitioner had sought the license keeping in view
his profession which was disclosed in paragraph-3 of the writ petition as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/113182084/ 3
The State Of Bihar And Ors vs Deepak Kumar on 21 January, 2019
"3. That the petitioner is a citizen of India and a business man by Profession dealing
in gold business and is invoking the Jurisdiction of this Hon'ble High Court in its writ
Jurisdiction."
The order of the District Magistrate, as communicated, does not indicate the existence of any valid
reason, but, at the same time, the order in appeal passed by the Commissioner indicates that there
was no mention of any specific security threat or danger to the appellant in the police report. Such a
ground, in our opinion, would be contrary to the intent of grant of license inasmuch as it is not
necessary that a person should have an actual threat or imminent threat perception, but it would
suffice if the applicant is able to persuade the authority to take into consideration the nature of his
trade, profession and calling for the purpose of grant of license which situation has now been taken
care of under Sub-Rule (3)(a) of Rule 12 of the 2016 Rules. In this view of the matter, the question of
grant or refusal of license will have to be revisited by the licensing authority where the licensing
authority will have the power to make an assessment as per the aforesaid Rules, keeping in view the
police report or such other factors which may be necessary for the said purpose. The Advocate
General is, therefore, Patna High Court LPA No.758 of 2018 dt.21-01-2019 right in his submission to
the extent that there cannot be an omnibus declaration in respect of a reason which can also
possibly form part of the refusal or grant of license, namely the possibility or probability of any
threat or imminent danger to the life or property of an individual. Such factors, in our opinion, are
admissible factors, especially in the light of the 2016 Rules which now take care of the situation.
Accordingly, the impugned judgement of the learned Single Judge, to that extent, would stand
modified, subject to the direction of the learned Single Judge to consider the grant of license to the
respondent-petitioner in accordance with the 2016 Rules and take a fresh decision in the matter
within the time period given therein.
The appeal stands disposed of, subject to above.
