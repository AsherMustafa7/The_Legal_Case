shown has not been prepared after complying the mandatory provision of rule 5(3)(c)(e) of U.P.
Gangsters & Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Rules, 2021. The gang chart has been signed on
different dates, which clearly shows that gang chart has not been prepared as per rule.
It is further submitted that applicant has criminal history of 23 other cases including the cases of
Gang-chart. It is further submitted that the applicant explained the criminal history of 23 other
cases in paragraph 3 of the supplementary affidavit in tabular form in chronological order. It is
further submitted that eight cases are related to U.P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, which are
related to the years 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2023 and 2024. It is further submitted that in all cases,
applicant is granted bail. It is further submitted that there is no pre-summoning evidence or inquiry
was made against the applicant for property which is alleged to have been gained by the aforesaid
criminal history.
It is further submitted that there is no pre-summoning evidence with regard to the fact that the
applicant has run any gang or a gang leader as defined in the Act. It is next contended that applicant
is neither a member of any gang nor a gang leader and he is not indulged in any anti-social activities
as alleged by the prosecution in the first information report. It is further submitted that there is no
other evidence with regard to tampering the evidence in the pending cases.
It is further submitted that the provisions of the Act have been ill-used by the Police in order to
perpetuate the detention of the applicant in jail anyhow even though the offence under the aforesaid
Act is not made out. It is also submitted that the applicant is not a gangster and has never acted or
conducted himself as such. Learned counsel for the applicant has also tried to demonstrate that the
alleged previous offences which are said to have been committed by the applicant can at the most be
said to be stray incident of breach of law having no nexus with the definition of a gangster as has
been provided in the Act.
Learned counsel for the applicant further urged that the F.I.R. in question has been lodged without
containing the facts that the applicant is a member of gang as provided in the Act. It is further
submitted that other co-accused Tanveer, Haneef, Kaleem, Ikram, Rashid, Shahzad, Gayyur, Nawab

dated 06.09.2024. The applicant is languishing in jail since 12.05.2024.

Vs. Shiv Raj Singh @ Lalla Babu and another, (2012) 9 SCC 446 and Prabhakar Tiwari Vs. State of
U.P. and another, (2020) 11 SCC 648 wherein the Apex Court has observed that pendency of other

Najim vs State Of U.P. on 2 January, 2025
Per contra, learned A.G.A. has opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant by contending that the
innocence of the applicant cannot be adjudged at pre trial stage, therefore, he does not deserve any
indulgence. In case the applicant is released on bail, he will again indulge in similar activities and
will misuse the liberty of bail.
It is well settled position of law that bail is the rule and committal to jail is an exception and refusal
of bail is a restriction on the personal liberty of the individual guaranteed under Article 21 of the
Constitution [Vide State of Rajasthan Vs. Balchand @ Baliay (1977) 4 SCC 308 Gudikanti
Narasimhulu And Ors Vs. Public Prosecutor, High Court Of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 429 and
Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Another, (2021) 10 SCC 773.] No
material or circumstances has been brought to the notice of this Court with regard to tampering of
evidence or intimidating of witnesses in previous criminal history.
Keeping in mind, larger mandate of Article 21 of the constitution of India, the nature of accusations,
the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of punishment which conviction will entail,
the character of the accused-applicant, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable
possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the
witnesses being tampered with, the larger interest of the public/ State and other circumstances and
after considering the provision of Section 19(4) of the U.P. Gangsters Act, but without expressing
any opinion on the merits, I am of the view that it is a fit case for grant of bail. Hence, present bail
application is allowed.
Let applicant Nazim released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on his furnishing a
personal bond and two reliable sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court
concerned subject to the following conditions:
(i) The applicant shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat, or
promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him
from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with the
evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall not pressurize/intimidate the prosecution witnesses.
(iii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates
fixed for (a) opening of the case, (b) framing of charge and (c) recording of statement
under Section 313 of Cr.P.C.

adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in the
trial court.

(vi) The applicant shall not indulge in any criminal activity or commission of any
crime after being released on bail.
In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. If in the
opinion of the trial court that absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then
it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed in
accordance with law.
The trial court may make all possible efforts/endeavor and try to conclude the trial expeditiously in
accordance with law after the release of the applicant, if there is no other legal impediment.

of this bail application and will in no way be construed as an expression on the merits of the case.
The trial court shall be absolutely free to arrive at its independent conclusions on the basis of
evidence led unaffected by anything said in this order.

said person (preferably Aadhar Card) mentioning the mobile number to which the said Aadhar Card
is linked.
