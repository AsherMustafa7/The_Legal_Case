Re: L.P.A. No. 619 of 2018
This appeal assails the judgment dated 26 th March,
2018 in C.W.J.C. No. 16539 of 2016, whereby the respondent-
petitioner has been found entitled to certain pecuniary service
benefits at par with the judgment in the case of Abdus Salam Vs.

post of Laboratory-In-charge and Demonstrator in Rajendra

College, Chapra, a constituent of the appellant University.
2. We had heard the matter on 26th April, 2019 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185844683/ 2
Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
had passed the following order:
"Heard Shri Anjani Kumar, learned
Senior Counsel for the appellant-University.
Shri Purushottam Jha, learned Advocate who
has put in appearance in this case for the
respondent-petitioner and had also conducted
the case on behalf of the writ petitioner before
the writ Court. His name shall be shown in the
cause list accordingly.
This appeal arises out of the
judgment of the learned single Judge dated
26.03.2018
, whereby the learned single Judge taking notice of the judgment in the case of Abdus Salam vs.
State of Bihar (C.W.J.C. No.2002 of 2010, decided on 21.09.2010) and affirmed by a Division Bench
in L.P.A. No.981 of 2011, decided on 11th July, 2011, the S.L.P. against which was dismissed on
27.2.2012 , has arrived at a conclusion that the respondent- petitioner was entitled to the benefits as
claimed by him as his case is covered by the aforesaid decision.
The challenge raised is that the aforesaid judgment in the case of Abdus Salam (supra) does not
apply on the facts of the present case and consequently, the conclusion drawn by the learned single
Judge without Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 examining the status of the
claim of the respondent-petitioner cannot stand the scrutiny of law.
It is urged that the stand of the University as per the facts disclosed by the State Government was
clearly to the effect that the post against which the respondent-petitioner was claiming salary had
not been sanctioned by the State Government in terms of Section 35 of the Bihar State Universities
Act, 1976. It was also the stand of the University in the counter affidavit filed before the learned
single Judge that the mode and manner of appointment of the respondent petitioner was not
processed as per rules and therefore the claim made by him had been withheld.
The records indicate that on 11th April, 2017, a learned single Judge, who was hearing the writ
petition giving rise to this appeal, passed an order that if any payment of salary is to be made to the
respondent-
petitioner, at least with regard to his current salary, the same should be made and reflected in the
counter affidavit to be filed on behalf of the University. It is pursuant to the aforesaid order that a
counter affidavit came to be filed where these facts were stated, as noted above.
While going through the records of the writ petition, we find that the appointment of the
respondent-petitioner is stated to have Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 been
notified by the Principal of the College on 10th April, 1985. This was followed by an office order of
the Vice-Chancellor issued under the signature of the Registrar dated 9th of May, 1985, which is
Annexure 4 to the writ petition. The claim of the respondent-petitioner of salary ensued thereafter
as it was not certain as to whether the salary would be paid by the State fund or by the University,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185844683/ 3
Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
upon which the University called upon the Principal of the Institution to furnish information with
regard to the fact as to whether the post of the Laboratory Incharge as held by the
respondent-petitioner was within the staffing pattern of the College or not. The Principal of the
Institution, vide Annexure 15, informed the University that the post fell within the staffing pattern.
From the records, we further find that there was further communication with regard to payment of
salary of the respondent- petitioner and on 15th July, 2010 the University through the Registrar who
notified the designation of the respondent-petitioner as a Demonstrator keeping in view the
resolution of the Government dated 14th of June, 2006. The said document is Annexure 21 to the
writ petition and the resolution of the Government dated 14.06.2006 is Annexure 28. It is in this
background that the respondent-petitioner claimed his benefits contending that since he is Patna
High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 designated as Demonstrator by the University
itself, there is no occasion for the University now to trace back its steps and deny the consequential
benefits.
Shri Purushottam Jha, learned counsel for the respondent-petitioner contends that once it is
established that the respondent- petitioner's appointment was within the staffing pattern, then
creation/sanction of post shall be deemed to have been accepted and for that he relies upon a Full
Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Braj Kishore Singh v. State of Bihar, reported in 1997(1)
PLJR 509, paragraph 12 in particular. He submits that the said judgment has been later on followed
in the same matter by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Braj Kishore Singh v. State of
Bihar, reported in 2004(3) PLJR 668. To counter the same, Shri Anjani Kumar, learned Senior
Counsel for the appellant-University has cited the judgment in the case of Upendra Singh v. State of
Bihar(Civil Appeal No.2356 of 2018, decided on 23rd of February, 2018). A couple of Division Bench
judgments of this Court have also been cited at the Bar to substantiate the aforesaid submissions.
Prima facie, on the basis of whatever material has been placed before the Court, we find that the
basic issue is as to whether the appointment of the respondent- Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of
2018 dt.30-07-2019 petitioner having been validly made was within the sanctioned strength of the
Institution and as to whether the status of his appointment stands supported by the decisions, which
have been cited at the Bar.
Thus, in order to further proceed with the matter, learned counsel for the parties pray that the
matter may be taken up on 6th May, 2019.
Let the matter come up on 6th May, 2019.
In the meantime, Shri Jha, learned counsel for the respondent may file a response, if any required
for the purpose of this appeal."
3. The matter was again heard by us in response to the aforesaid queries and Shri Anjani Kumar,
learned senior counsel for the appellant-University has urged that in the absence of a sanctioned
post and in the absence of the procedure prescribed in law for appointing the respondent-petitioner,
no relief can be granted and his case is clearly distinguishable and not at par with the case of Abdus
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185844683/ 4
Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
Salam. He further submits that the judgments relied on by the respondent-petitioner as referred to
in the query raised by this Court are no longer applicable in view of the law laid down by a
Constitution Bench in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi (3), reported in Patna
High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 (2006) 4 SCC 1. He has further invited the attention
of the Court to the decision of the Chancellor dated 22.02.2011 whereby the earlier financial and
administrative decisions of the University stood withdrawn as a result whereof the respondent
petitioner was not entitled to claim the benefits as prayed for.
4. Elaborating his submissions, Shri Anjani Kumar has invited the attention of the Court to the first
order of appointment of the respondent-petitioner which is by the Principal, Rajendra College,
Chapra dated 10.04.1985 and is as follows:
UNIVERSITY OF BIHAR Principal PHONE{ Office: 2321 Resd. 12400 RAJENDRA

5. It is pointed out that this letter of appointment has been issued by the Principal of
the College and not by the Vice Chancellor who is the Appointing Authority. The
respondent-petitioner was appointed as Laboratory Incharge of the Post Graduate
Chemistry Department against a vacant post and was temporary in nature subject to
approval by the University.
6. It is then pointed out that the order came to be Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of
2018 dt.30-07-2019 passed for the first time in the name of the Vice Chancellor

of the post by the State Government. The said order dated 9 th of May, 1985 is
extracted hereinunder:-

7. It is then urged by him that the Registrar issued a direction to the Principal on
24.06.1985 that till the post is sanctioned and the grant is released from the State
Government, the respondent-petitioner be paid salary from the fee income collected
from the Post Graduate students of the Institution. The Finance Officer of the
University accordingly issued directions and the respondent-petitioner continued to
function in the University. The University continued to make the payments.

Accordingly, the petitioner represented the matter before the College and his
representation was forwarded to the University with regard to payments to which he
was entitled and with regard to certain payments that had been Patna High Court
L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 withheld between 1991-92. The University
ultimately on 13th of December, 1995 passed a resolution in respect of the petitioner,
which is extracted hereinunder:-

8. A perusal of the said resolution indicates that with regard to another College
namely H.R. College, Amnaur the State Government had created two post on
17.12.1982 in the pay-scale of Rs. 680-965/- revised to Rs. 1320-2040/-. Accordingly,
it was resolved that the respondent-petitioner Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of
2018 dt.30-07-2019 would continue to get the salary that he was getting and a
request be made to the State Government in this regard.
9. The University in response to a query made by the Principal of the Institution
wrote a letter on 20 th December, 1997 that the appointment of the
respondent-petitioner was within the staffing pattern and the norms prescribed and
therefore his appointment was in accordance with the same. The said letter is
extracted hereinunder as it forms one of the basic arguments advanced on behalf of
the respondent- petitioner:

Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019
10. A dispute was raised with regard to the payments to be made to the
respondent-petitioner along with some other employees and in the meantime in view
of certain judicial pronouncements the designation of the post as that of
Demonstrator ensued. The Principal of Rajendra College, Chapra, where the
respondent-petitioner was working, wrote a letter to that effect to the Registrar along
with the details of his appointment. This was to be done pursuant to the notification
dated 14th June, 2006, copy whereof has been filed as Annexure-28 to the writ
petition. Consequently, a notification was issued by the University on 15th July, 2010
indicating the re-designation of the respondent-petitioner as Demonstrator. The
notification of re-designation was approved by the University that is on record. The
University while submitting this pay-fixation recommendations to the Government
included the name of the respondent-petitioner showing his designation as Assistant
Demonstrator in the College. Thus, the University itself continued to treat the
respondent-petitioner within the staffing pattern of Rajendra College, Chapra as an
Assistant Demonstrator in the Laboratory of the College. While showing the details of
expenditure, the charts which were filed by the University and the budget demanded
indicated the expenditure Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 to
be incurred which included two lab personnel based on the staffing pattern of the
University. This entire chart is Annexure- 30 to the writ petition. The petitioner had
represented his entire matter on 15th of June, 2016 where he had entailed his entire
journey having served in the college and his service having been recognized by the
appellant-University.
11. The matter of designation as Demonstrators became subject matter of litigation
before this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 12967 of 2012 after the Government had withdrawn
the resolution dated 14.06.2006 referred to above. This withdrawal on 10th April,
2012 became subject matter of challenge in the said writ petition.
12. The State Government had issued a letter on 16th of March, 2012 informing the
Accountant General of payments being made to the staff appointed based on the
staffing pattern of the Institution, particularly with regard to the Laboratory Staff
working in colleges for which a budget of Rs. 10,74,27,432/- was released. This
document of 16th March, 2012 is Annexure-40 to the writ petition. This is one of the
documents which indicates the release of payments by the Government as against the
post, one of which was being occupied by the respondent-petitioner. The chart
enclosed with Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 this notification
at page 164 of the paper-book and duly counter signed by the concerned Secretary of
the Education Department is extracted hereinunder:-

13. A perusal thereof would indicate that at Serial No. 3 the College in which the
respondent-petitioner is working as a Laboratory Personnel is included and which
also indicates the designation as a Demonstrator together with the salary admissible
to the respondent-petitioner.
14. It is in this background that the respondent-
petitioner filed a writ petition giving rise to the present controversy and claimed payment of salary
at par with the benefits extended to Abdus Salam and others. Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of
2018 dt.30-07-2019
15. During the course of the arguments in the present appeal, learned counsel for the
respondent-petitioner has also invited the attention of the Court to the notification of the Education
Department dated 17.08.1979 to contend that the continuance of the respondent-petitioner after
appointment is in conformity with the norms prescribed in the staffing pattern of Laboratory Staff
in the Universities including the Bhagalpur University. The said notification dated 17.08.1979 is
reproduced hereinunder:-

16. Shri Anjani Kumar, learned senior counsel for the appellant-University while advancing his
submissions has urged that the respondent-petitioner was not appointed after due advertisement
etc. as his appointment was not in conformity with law. The second argument is that any relief
relating to the re-designation on the post of Demonstrator is inadmissible. The third argument is
that there was no sanctioned post by the State Government and, therefore, the directions issued by
the learned Single Judge drawing parity with the case of Abdus Salaam is unfounded. The 4th
argument is that even if in the case of Abdus Salam any directions were issued, the said judgment is
based on the two earlier Full Bench decisions in the case of Braj Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of
2018 dt.30-07-2019 Kishore Singh Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 1997 (1) PLJR 509 and
again in the same case Braj Kishore Singh Vs. State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2004 (3) PLJR
668.
17. The submission is that these decisions were rendered extending the benefit by treating such
employees to have become regular, but the ratio of the said decisions now stands diluted with the
Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Secretary, State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi (3), reported
in (2006) 4 SCC 1. He has further relied on the Full Bench decision in the case of Ram Sevak Yadav
& Anr. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors., reported in 2013(1) PLJR 964 to contend that such a benefit
cannot be extended in the background aforesaid. He has further relied on the judgment in the case
of Veer Kunwar Singh University Ad Hoc Teachers Association and others Vs. Bihar State University
(C.C.) Service Commission and others, reported in (2009) 17 SCC 184 and the judgment in the case
of Nand Lal Bhagat & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. decided on 25th July, 2013 that has been
affirmed in the case of Upendra Singh Vs. State of Bihar, reported in (2018) 3 SCC 680. These
judgments have been cited to contend that to treat employees on regular basis Patna High Court
L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 would be permissible only if the initial appointments were valid

Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
and against sanctioned posts. He has submitted that even now there is no such sanctioned post and,
therefore, the direction issued by the learned Single Judge cannot be sustained.
18. To begin with, we may first point out that from the letter dated 17.08.1979, extracted
hereinabove, the creation and appointment on the post of Demonstrators had been banned with
effect from 18.09.1975 that had resulted in a lot of difficulties being faced by the laboratories in the
various departments of the University and Colleges. The Government, therefore, resolved that for
the purpose of science laboratories, an Assistant to be now appointed in the laboratories would be
known as Laboratory-In-charge with his specific qualification of Intermediate in science and would
be a Class-III post. The duties and responsibilities were defined therein and the norms fixed
thereunder are that if a laboratory is attended by a minimum of 32 students then there would be one
Laboratory- In-charge to assist the laboratory on this strength. If there are several shifts of such
students, there would only be a total of two Laboratory Assistants.
19. For Post Graduate classes, two Laboratory-In- charge personnel would be available and if there
is a special Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 laboratory, there would be one
more Laboratory-In-charge, but the total shall be to a maximum of five Laboratory-In-charge
personnel.
20. The petitioner, respondent herein, admittedly was the only Laboratory Attendant in the
Chemistry lab of the College. There is no dispute that the University did continue to treat him as
such which is evident from the resolutions that were passed by the University from time to time
including the resolution for designating him as a Demonstrator. The appellant-University, therefore,
itself had never disputed this fact about the continuance and the services of the respondent-
petitioner being taken by Rajendra College, Chapra. The argument raised by Shri Anjani Kumar on
this score is that the Chancellor had annulled the administrative and financial decisions of the
University on 22nd of February, 2011. We may point out that the University itself had been sending
the claim of the petitioner for payment of salary and it kept it under consideration. This is further
fortified by the document dated 16th March, 2012 which was based on the information given by the
University and had been sent by the State Government through a Secretary of the Education
Department informing the Accountant General with regard to the availability and the Patna High
Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 appointments made in Rajendra College, Chapra for
which a certain amount of budget had been released. This document of 16th March, 2012 is
subsequent to the decision of the Chancellor dated 22.02.2011 and, therefore, the argument that the
decision of the University had been annulled gets contradicted by the said evidence. The University,
therefore, cannot be allowed to take a stand different than its own documents which is now being
advanced on the ground as if the University had committed mistakes earlier and was seeking to
rectify the same at this stage.
21. It is for this that the argument now advanced is that the respondent-petitioner was not working
against a sanctioned post and his appointment had not been made in accordance with the procedure
prescribed. We may point out that with regard to the procedure adopted for the appointment of the
respondent-petitioner, the document available on record is the letter of appointment issued by the
University itself and which is dated 9th of May, 1985, extracted hereinabove. It is correct that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185844683/ 11
Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
said letter itself indicates the appointment being in anticipation of a sanctioned post, but at the
same time the appellant-University has been unable to dispute the position taken by the
respondent-petitioner that his appointment was Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018
dt.30-07-2019 within the staffing pattern as prescribed by the State Government in the notification
dated 17.08.1979. This aspect of an appointment being valid, if it is within the sanctioned strength
was subject matter of the two Full Benches in the case of Braj Kishore Singh Vs. State of Bihar
(supra) where it has been held that if the post is being held by a person within the staffing pattern,
the same cannot be held to be a non-sanctioned post. To the contrary, the sanction will be deemed
and presumed to have been made if it is within the staffing pattern. The said decision has been
relied on in the case of Abdus Salam (supra) and which matter has now attained finality up to the
Apex Court. It is for this reason that the learned Single Judge under the impugned judgment has
extended the benefits of payment of salary and other pecuniary benefits to the respondent-petitioner
in the light of the law laid down therein. This is further fortified by the fact that on the basis of the
information tendered by the appellant University, the State Government had sent the documents to
the Accountant General acknowledging the fact of the existence of the post for which salary was
being claimed including the post of the respondent-petitioner.
22. It is the appellant-University which has come up in appeal questioning the services of almost 34
years spent Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 by the respondent-petitioner
being the only Laboratory-In- charge in the College, and not the State. This additional feature,
therefore, also goes in favour of the respondent-petitioner that the appellant-University which had
itself allowed the induction of the respondent-petitioner is now disputing his claim when it comes to
monetary benefits. The University is estopped by its own conduct throughout in now disputing the
claim of respondent-petitioner after he has discharged more than 33 years of service. This would not
only be unjust but also amongst equity and fair play. It is well settled that law is good but justice is
better. This is one of the cases where the employer in spite of having acknowledged the continuance
of the respondent-petitioner for more than 33 years and there being no effort to withdraw the letter
of appointment of 1985, has questioned the claim of the respondent-petitioner but the issues were
legally answered against the University referred to hereinabove.
23. We, therefore, do not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel for the University
on the issue of the manner of appointment and the post occupied by the respondent-petitioner in
the above given circumstances. The argument based on the judgment in the case of Umadevi Patna
High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 (supra) and the case of Ram Sevak Yadav (supra)
that the same dilutes and takes away the impact of the earlier Full Bench judgment in the case of
Braj Kishore Singh (supra) is an argument that would not apply logically, inasmuch as, the case of
Umadevi (supra) or Ram Sevak Yadav (supra) or even for that matter Upendra Singh (supra) all
relate to regularization of services where it has been held that regularization can be extended if the
appointment was irregular, and not illegal, that too even against a sanctioned post.
24. In our opinion, the present is not a case of regularization as is being claimed by the appellant,
inasmuch as, the respondent-petitioner has taken the stand of having been appointed in accordance
with the staffing pattern and to that extent the judgment of Braj Kishore Singh (supra) laying down
the law in favour of the respondent-petitioner has not been diluted by any subsequent judgment nor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185844683/ 12
Jai Prakash University Chapra Through ... vs The State Of Bihar on 30 July, 2019
it has been overruled. The said judgment is on the issue of staffing pattern and not on the issue of
regularization.
25. The instant is also a case where the claim is based on having continued in service and treated as
such by the appellant-University for long without having withdrawn any benefits that were extended
to the respondent-petitioner Patna High Court L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 including his
continuance in service. The University has never withdrawn the letter of appointment issued in
favour of the respondent-petitioner way back in the year 1985. His appointment was neither
cancelled nor was it held to be unlawful or beyond the sanctioned strength prescribed in the staffing
pattern. There being no material to contradict this aspect, the law relating to regularization would
not affect the respondent-petitioner as urged on behalf of the appellant- University.
26. Learned counsel for the appellant Shri Anjani Kumar urged that the judgment in the case of
Abdus Salam (supra) does not take into consideration these issues and, therefore, the same cannot
be treated to be good law so as to bind this Court to follow the same.
27. We may only point out that the learned Single Judge has noted these facts and which have also
been noticed by us while recording the submissions on 26th April, 2019 extracted hereinabove. The
Special Leave Petition in the said matter was dismissed on 27th of February, 2012 and we can safely
presume that this argument which is now being advanced was very much available then and yet it
did not find favour in the decision of Abdus Salam. Consequently, the case of the Patna High Court
L.P.A No.619 of 2018 dt.30-07-2019 respondent-petitioner cannot be distinguished from the case of
Abdus Salam Vs. State of Bihar (supra). We, therefore, do not find any merit in this appeal, which is
accordingly rejected.
