boarding facilities to the students who are children of the labourers under the caption "Shramoday
Vidyalaya" with an object to provide better education to the children of the labourers who could not
get the education due to money constraints. Under the scheme a selection examination is conducted
annually. In the case at hand, the examinations were conducted on 30.5.2018 for the academic
session 2018-2019 and the district-wise admissions were granted in various schools. The same was
in accordance with the guidelines framed by the State Government and the decision taken thereon
for effective implementation of the scheme to reach out to the maximum students at district level.
This would be evident from the brochure brought on record as Annexure P/1. Clause 8 (iv) whereof
stipulates:

Grievance raised by the petitioners is that instead of forming unified combined merit list the
department has wrongly taken recourse to admit the students district-wise, as a result whereof
students like petitioners despite being more meritorious have been deprived of admission in a
particular district. In this context, the petitioners vide present petition seeks following directions:

during pendency of the THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
W.P.No.17012/2018 (Narendra Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and others)
present petition certain wait-listed candidates namely petitioners no.1, 2,3,4,5, 10
and 12 were given admission to the respective classes on the basis of their position in
the waiting list.
The respondents have filed their return, wherein they have contradicted the stand
taken by the petitioners that the admissions have been granted dehors the scheme
mooted by the State Government. It is urged that the respondent no.2, who is an
Authority Competent to take decision as regard to reservation ratio which has been
fixed as per the population of the construction labourers of each district and the said
decision has been duly approved by the Chairman of the Board as per decision dated
2.6.2018. It is urged that the district-wise merit list was directed to be prepared. The
entrance examination was got conducted by the Director of School Education and the
admissions were strictly granted on the basis of the decision taken by the Competent
Authority as contained in Annexure R/2. It is submitted by the respondents that total

strength of the schools situated at Gwalior is near about 800 students of all classes
out of which 476 admissions were made as per the merit list prepared for the vacant
seats and the procedure as per waiting list. It is further contended that the petitioners
cannot claim any benefit against the students Ku. Anushika as she has not been
impleaded as party respondents. Even otherwise being female she has been granted
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.No.17012/2018 (Narendra Singh
and others Vs. State of M.P. and others) admission in the female category as per 50%
reservation for women category. Therefore, there cannot be comparison between age
of Pratap Singh and Ku. Anushika. The contention on behalf of the petitioners is that
petitioners want admission in Class VIII and Class IX and that less meritorious got
admission is also not correct as the admission has been made strictly district-wise
and on these contentions the respondent no.1 seeks dismissal of the petition.
The respondents no.2 to 5 have also filed the return, wherein while reiterating the
stand taken by the State of Madhya Pradesh it is urged that there is no illegality
committed in granting admission to the students district-wise.
Considered the rival submissions.
Evidently, the admission relates to academic session 2018-2019 which has already
been made and even if for arguments sake it is accepted that the petitioners who are
in the waiting list are held to be entitled for the relief as claimed for, the admission
cannot be granted in mid session, therefore, contentions raised by the petitioners
based on the scheme in vogue assume of academic nature as would warrant any
adjudication in present petition. Evidently the examinations are held year to year
basis and there is no provision commended at as would establish that a telescoping of
admission is permissible.
THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH W.P.No.17012/2018 (Narendra Singh
and others Vs. State of M.P. and others) In view whereof, since no relief can be
granted to the petitioners, petition fails and is dismissed. However, the legal issues
raised are kept open for the future in appropriate matter. No costs.
