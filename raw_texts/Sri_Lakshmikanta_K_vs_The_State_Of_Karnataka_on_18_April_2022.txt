Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 3
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
Or read down the proviso to Section 11(1)(b) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 as not
applying to elections to the post of President and Vice-President of the Municipal Council held
under Section 42(2) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 and the rules framed thereunder.
(v) Declare that the proviso to Article 243-R (2)(a) of the Constitution of India is ultra vires Article
14 of the Constitution of India and contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution.
Or read down the proviso to Article 243-R (2)(a) of the Constitution as not applying to the post of
President and the vice president of the Municipal Council held under Section 42(2) of the Karnataka
Municipalities Act, 1964 and the rules framed there under.
(vi) Declare that the Petitioners are entitled to participate and cast their vote in the election for the
post of President, Malur Town Municipal Corporation by virtue of being nominated councilors of
the Malur Town Municipal Council under the provisions of Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964.
(vii) Grant cost of these proceedings; and
(viii) Pass such orders or directions as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit in the facts and
circumstances of the case.
2. The Council was constituted on 20.05.2018, which has 29 elected members as well as 4
nominated members and one member of Legislative Assembly. The President of the Council was
elected on 20.11.2020. The petitioners were nominated as Councilors of the Council on 27.02.2021.
The Tahsildar and Election Officer issued calendar of events by which election to the post of
President of the Council was notified and the same was scheduled to be held on 30.12.2021.The
petitioners who are the nominated members of the Council, filed a writ petition, in which inter alia
declaration was sought to the effect that they are entitled to participate in the process of election to
the post of President of the Council. A bench of this court by an interim order dated 29.12.2021
permitted the petitioners to participate in the process of election for the post of President of the
Council subject to final decision of the writ petition.
3. An election was held on 30.12.2021, in which the petitioners cast their votes for the election to the
post of the President of the Council. The petitioner in WP No.834/2022 filed an I.A. for impleading
on 10.01.2022 in W.P.No.24308/2021, filed by the petitioners. The petitioner in WP No.834/2022
thereafter withdrew the interlocutory application for impleading on 07.02.2022. Thereafter, a bench
of this court vide order dated 22.02.2022 permitted the petitioners in W.P.No.24308/2021 to
withdraw the writ petition with the liberty as prayed for and extended the interim order for a period
of 7 days. In the aforesaid factual background, this petition has been filed.
4. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioners who are nominated
councilors of Malur Town Municipal Council have assailed the validity of section 11(1)(b) of the
Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964 as well as the Constitutional validity of proviso to Article
243-R(2)(a) of the Constitution of India on the ground that same is violative of Article 14 and is
contrary to basic structure to constitution of India. It is urged that alternatively the petitioners have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 4
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
sought the relief of reading down the proviso to Section 11(1)(b) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act
so as to not apply to the elections for the post of President and Vice President of Municipal Council
held under Section 42(2) of the Karnataka Municipalities Act. It is urged that the provisions of
Section 11(1)(b) of the Act do not apply to meeting held to elect the President and therefore, the
petitioners have right to vote in the aforesaid election.
5. It is contended that Karnataka Municipalities (President and Vice President) Election Rules, 1965
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules' for short) does not bar the nominated members from
participating in the election to the post of President in the Municipality. It is further contended that
Article 243R and the Rules make a distinction between the right of members to vote in the election
and the meetings of council as contemplated under Chapter III of the Act. It is also contended that
the definition of the 'councilor' in the Act and the language of Rules made thereunder does not
exclude nominated councilors from voting in the election to the post of President. It is argued that
the expression 'meeting' used in proviso to Section 11(1) of the Act is distinct from an election of the
President of Municipal council. Our attention has also been invited to Section 42(2) of the Act and it
is urged that scheme and arrangement of the Act indicates that detailed procedure for meetings
envisaged under Chapter IIIA is distinct for the purpose of electing a President in the Municipal
Council. It is contended that meeting under Section 47 of the Act is different from the election of
President of the Council.
6. It is further contended that precedence must be read in the context in which they have been
made. It is argued that decisions in 'SAVITRI VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA', ILR 2003 KAR 4653,
'RAMESH MEHTA VS. SANWAL CHAND SINGHVI AND OTHERS', (2004) 5 SCC 409,
'SMT.PRAMILA M. VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA', ILR 2015 KAR 5872 do not have any application
to the facts of the case in hand. In support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on
decisions in 'KHALIQUZ ZAMAN VS. STATE OF U.P. AND OTHERS', 2004 SCC ONLINE ALL
1455, 'DADI JAGANNADHAM VS. JAMMULU RAMULU', (2001) 7 SCC 71, ' ROHITASH KUMAR
VS. OM PRAKASH SHARMA', (2013) 11 SCC 451, 'ARASMETA CAPITVE POWER CO. (P) LTD VS.
LAFARGE INDIA (P) LTD', (2013) 15 SCC 414, 'KRISHENA KUMAR VS. UNION OF INDIA', (1990)
4 SCC 207, 'ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH VS. U.P. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION', (2003) 11 SCC
584, 'PADMA SUNDARA RAO VS. STATE OF T.N.', (2002) 3 SCC 533, 'RAEES AHMAD VS. STATE
OF U.P.', (2000) 1SCC 432, 'YASHODAMMA G. VS. STATE OF KARNATAKA', ILR 2003 KAR 3414,

1956 SCR 644, 'COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, BANGALORE VS. VENAKTESWARA
HATCHERIES', (1993) 3 SCC 632.
7. On the other hand, learned Senior Counsel for Respondent No.6 submitted that once the
W.P.No.24308/2021 was withdrawn, the interim order merged with the final order and the effect of
withdrawal of the writ petition is that the order dated 22.02.2022, by which writ petition was
withdrawn and liberty was reserved to Respondent No.6 to file an application for restitution of his
right has become final and therefore, the writ petition filed by the petitioners is liable to be
dismissed. It is also submitted that the order dated 22.02.2022, permitting withdrawal of the writ
petition does not permit the petitioners to challenge Article 243-R(2)(a) of the Constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 5
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
It is pointed out that the relief claimed in prayer clause No.(ii), (iii) and (vi) have been rendered
infructuous as meeting to elect the President of the Council has already been held. It is also
submitted that the Petitioners have no right to get elected to the post of President and therefore,
have no locus to question the further proceeding.
8. It is contended that there is no pleading in the writ petition as to what is the basic structure of the
Constitution and how Article 243-R(2)(a) constitutes the basic structure of the Constitution. It is
further contended that Article 243-ZF constitutes an embargo that voting rights cannot be given to
nominated members. It is also urged that Section 11(1)(b) of the Act is in consonance with Article
243-R(2)(a) of the Constitution of India. It is urged that the right to vote and contest an election are
not fundamental right but at best are constitutional rights. It is also urged that there is a
presumption in favor of constitutionality of the provision and the petitioner have miserably failed to
rebut the aforesaid presumption. It is contended that nominated members have no right to vote and
the meeting recognized by the Act is either the special general meeting or an ordinary meeting and
in a meeting of the Council, the President of the Council is elected. Our attention has also been
invited to the Karnataka Municipalities (President and Vice-President) Election Rules, 1965
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Rules' for short). In support of the aforesaid submissions, reliance
has been placed on KALABHARATI ADVERTISING VS HEMANT VIMALNATH NARICHANIA &
ORS (2010) 9 SCC 437, CHARANJIT LAL CHOWDHURI VS THE UNION OF INDIA AND OTHERS
AIR 1951 SC 41, JYOTI PERSHAD VS THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE UNION TERRITORY OF

OTHERS (2006) 8 SCC 212, IR COELHO VS STATE OF TN (2007) 2 SCC 1.
9. Learned Additional Government Advocate submitted that the right to vote is a statutory right and
in the absence of violation of any fundamental right, the writ petition is not maintainable. It is also
submitted that neither Article 243R (2) nor Section 11(1)(b) of the Act violate the basic structure of
the Constitution of India. In support of the aforesaid submissions reliance has been placed on the
decisions in JYOTI BASU VS DEBI GHOSAL AIR 1982 SC 983, SMT. SAVITHRI VS STATE OF
KARNATKA ILR 2003 KAR 4653 AND SATINDER SINGH VS UNION OF INDIA AND ORS CWP
NO.20346/2016.
10. Learned Central Government Senior Panel Counsel submitted that petitioners have not pleaded
in the writ petition that either the Parliament lacks power to amend the Constitution or Article 243R
(2) violates the Fundamental Right guaranteed in Part II of the Constitution or is violative of basic
structure of the Constitution of India. It is therefore submitted that the prayer for declaring proviso
to Article 243R (2) as ultra vires cannot be granted. It is also submitted that nominated members of
the Council fall in different class and therefore, cannot claim equality with the elected members of
the Council. In support of aforesaid submissions, reliance has been placed on the decisions of the
Supreme Court in OM NARAIN AGARWAL VS NAGAR PALIKA, SHAHAJANPUR AND OTHERS
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 6
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
AIR 1993 SC 1440 AND ANKUL CHANDRA PRADHAN VS UNION OF INDIA AIR 1997 SC 2814.
11. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioners had filed an application
seeking amendment in W.P.No.24308/2021, and in view of the contention raised by the
respondents that the proposed amendment changes the nature of the proceedings, the writ petition
was withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh writ petition. Therefore, this writ petition has been filed
and the same cannot be said to be not maintainable. It is further submitted that the proviso to
Article 243R (2) (a) does not apply to manner of election for the post of President of the Council. It
is further submitted that conjoint reading of Section 42(2) and Section 2(6) of the Act, it is evident
that the nominated members have a right to vote in the meeting for election for the post of President
of the Council. It is pointed out that the decision of this Court in SMT. SAVITHRI SUPRA deals with
amended Section 42(9) of the Act and is based on a concession that the nominated members do not
have a right to vote. Therefore, the aforesaid decision is of no assistance to the Respondents. It is
also argued that the decision in Ramesh Mehta's case Supra is in the context of Section 65 of the
Rajasthan Act and there is no pari materia provision in the Act. Therefore, the same does not apply
to the fact situation of the case. It is also urged that the decision reported in ILR 2015 KAR 5872 is
in the context of provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act, whereas, the provisions of the Act are
different.
12. We have considered the rival submissions made on both sides and have perused the record. Now
we may advert to the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions. Article 243-R (2) (a) read as
under:
243R. Composition of Municipalities.--
(1) Save as provided in clause (2), all the seats in a Municipality shall be filled by
persons chosen by direct election from the territorial constituencies in the Municipal
area and for this purpose each Municipal area shall be divided into territorial
constituencies to be known as wards (2) The Legislature of a State may, by law,
provide--
(a) for the representation in a Municipality of--
(i) persons having special knowledge or experience in Municipal administration;
(ii) the members of the House of the People and the members of the Legislative
Assembly of the State representing constituencies which comprise wholly or partly
the Municipal area;
(iii) the members of the Council of States and the members of the Legislative Council
of the State registered as electors within the Municipal area;
(iv) the Chairpersons of the Committees constituted under clause (5) of article 243S:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 7
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
Provided that the persons referred to in paragraph (i) shall not have the right to vote
in the meetings of the Municipality;
Thus, Article 243R (2)(a) mandates that nominated members shall not have right to
vote in the meetings of the Municipality.
13. The relevant sections of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964:
Section 2. Definitions:
xxx (6 ) 'Councillor' means a person who is legally a member of municipal council [or
Town Panchayat] Section 11. Constitution of municipal councils.--
(1) The municipal council shall consist of:
XXX
(b) not more than five persons nominated by the Government from amongst the
residents of the municipal area and who are,--
(i) persons having special knowledge and experience in municipal administration or
matters relating to health, town planning or education, or
(ii) social workers.
(c) the members of the House of the People and the members of the State Legislative
Assembly, representing a part or whole of the municipal area whose constituencies lie
within the municipal area ;
(d) the members of the Council of States and members of the State Legislative
Council registered as electors within the municipal area:
Provided that the persons referred to in clause (b) shall not have the right to vote in
the meetings of the municipal council.
Thus, proviso appended to Section 11 (1) of the Act, is in consonance with Article
243R (2)(a) of the Constitution of India.
Section 42. President and vice-
president.--
(1) XXX
(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2A) the Councillors shall at the first
meeting of the Municipal Council after the general election and at a subsequent
meeting held immediately before the expiry of term of office of the President and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 8
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
Vice-
president chose two members from amongst the elected councillors to be respectively president and
Vice-President and so often as there is a casual vacancy in the office of the President, or Vice
President shall choose another member from amongst the elected councillors to be the President or
Vice- president, as the case may be.
XXXX (9) Every president and every vice-president of a municipal council shall forthwith be
deemed to have vacated his office if a resolution expressing want of confidence in him is passed by a
1 [majority total number of councillors having voting right and by a majority of not less than
two-thirds of the councillors having voting right present and voting]1 at a special general meeting
convened for the purpose:
Provided that no such resolution shall be moved unless notice of the resolution is
signed by not less than one-third of the total number of councillors having voting
right and at least ten days' notice has been given of the intention to move the
resolution Provided further that where a resolution expressing want of confidence in
any president or vice-president has been considered and negatived by a municipal
council, a similar resolution in respect of the same president or vice-president shall
not be given notice of or moved within one year from the date of the decision of the
municipal council.
Section 47. Meeting.--
(1) The municipal council shall ordinarily hold at least one meeting in every month
for the transaction of business, which shall be called an ordinary general meeting.
14. The relevant Rules of the Karnataka Municipalities (President and Vice-President) Election
Rules, 1965:
Rule 3. Appointment of date of meeting- The election of President and Vice-President
shall be held in a meeting fixed by the Election Officer and he shall thereupon send to
every councillor notice of dates so fixed not less than seven days prior to the date of
meeting.
Rule 4. Filing of Nominations-
Not less than two hours before the time fixed for the meeting of for the election of
President and Vice President any Councillor may nominate any other elected
Councillor for being elected as President or Vice- President as the case may be, by
delivering to the Election Officer, a nomination paper completed in Form 1.
Rule 8. Procedure in contested and uncontested elections-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 9
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
(1) After the time fixed for withdrawal is over if there is only one candidate who has
been validly nominated , and has not withdrawn his candidature in the manner and
within the time specified the Election Officer shall forthwith declare such candidate
to be duly elected as President or Vice President, as the case may be.
Xxxx (4) Any member present at the meeting may refrain from voting if he so chooses to do. Xxxx
(7) The election Officer shall cause a record of the minutes of the meeting which shall contain the
names of all the Councilors present and in case of a division, the manner of their voting including
their absentations. The minutes shall be signed by the Election Officer as well as the Councillors
present. The minutes shall be made available to any Councillor for inspection.
Explanation: For the purpose of this Rule, "Councilor present" means Councilor present at the
meeting and whose names have been recorded before declaring the a Councilor duly elected under
Rule 8 or before the commencement of the meeting after withdrawal of candidature under Sub- rule
(4) of Rule 7 for the office of the President or Vice-President as the case may be.
15. Article 243R(2)(a) of the Constitution of India provides for composition of Council. Article 243R
(1) provides that the Council shall have elected members whereas, Article 243R (2) provides that a
member can also be nominated to the Council. The proviso to Article 243R (2) (a) mandates that
nominated members of the Council shall not have a right to vote in the meetings of the Council.
16. Similarly, Section 11(1)(b) of the Act provides for composition of the Council. Section 11(1) (a)
provides that the Council shall have elected members whereas, Section 11(1)(b) provides that not
more than 5 persons can be nominated as Councilors. The proviso to Section 11(1) of the Act
provides that the nominated members shall not have a right to vote in the meetings of the Council.
17. A three judge Bench of the Supreme Court in PEOPLE'S UNION FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES VS
UNION OF INDIA (2003) 4 SCC 399 has held that right to vote is not a fundamental right but is a
constitutional right. Similar view was taken by the Supreme Court in Rajbala Vs State of Haryana
(2016) 2 SCC 445. The elected members of the Council are chosen by popular vote and carry with
them, the mandate of the people, whereas, nominated members of the Council are appointed as
Councilors.
18. There is a presumption of Constitutional validity of a provision and the burden is on the person
to plead and prove its unconstitutionality. It is trite law that party invoking the protection of Article
14 has to make an averment with details to sustain such a plea and has to adduce material to
establish its allegations and the burden is on the party to plead and prove that its right under Article
14 has been infringed [SEE:
STATE OF UP VS KARTAR SINGH AIR 1964 SC 1135]. It is well settled legal
proposition that Article 14 can be invoked if unequals are treated equally or equals
are treated differently.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 10
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
It is equally well settled in law that mere differentiation or inequality of treatment
does not per se amount to discrimination the inhibition of equal protection clause
and to attract Article 14 it is necessary to demonstrate that selection or differentiation
is unreasonable or arbitrary and does not rest on any rational basis having regard to
the object which the legislature has in view while making the law in question.
[See: 'JAILA SINGH VS. STATE OF RAJASTHAN, AIR 74 SC 1436]. It is trite law
that party invoking the protection of Article 14 has to make an averment with details
to sustain such a plea and has to adduce material to establish its allegations and the
burden is on the party to plead and prove that its right under Article 14 has been
infringed [SEE: STATE OF UP VS KARTAR SINGH AIR 1964 SC 1135]. It is equally
well settled that in the absence of any pleading, the challenge to the constitutional
validity is to be rejected in limine. [STATE OF HARYANA VS STATE OF PUNJAB
2004 (12) SCC 673]
19. In the light of aforesaid well settled legal position, we may advert to the facts of the case. Article
243R (2) (a) has been assailed as violative of Article 14 and the Basic Structure of the Constitution of
India. It is pertinent to note that the nominated and elected members cannot be treated as
belonging to one class. The fundamental difference is that the elected Councillors are elected to the
office by a popular vote whereas, nominated members are appointed as Councillors. The Supreme
Court in RAMESH MEHTA VS SANWAL CHAND SINGHVI (2004) 5 SCC 405 dealt with the
question whether in counting 'the whole number of members of Municipal Board' in terms of Rule
3(9) of Rajasthan Municipalities (Motion of No-Confidence against Chairman or Vice-Chairman)
Rules, 1974, nominated members have to be taken into consideration. in Paragraph 11 of the
aforesaid decision, it was held as under:
11. In the present case, on facts, we are concerned with post-1994 position. Article
243-R brought about a drastic change in the matter of composition of Municipalities.
It lays down guidelines with regard to the constitution, composition, election and rights of the
members of a Municipality.
Under the said Act, members of a Municipality are persons chosen by direct election by the residents
of a municipal area (ward). Article 243-R(2)(a)(i) allows the legislature of a State to appoint any
person as a member of the Board who has special knowledge in the field of municipal
administration, however, the proviso appended to the said article precludes persons nominated
under sub-clause (i) from having a right to vote in the meetings of the Municipality. The
Constitution, therefore, makes a distinction between elected members and nominated members who
play essentially an advisory role.
Pursuant to the Seventy-fourth
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45745442/ 11
Sri Lakshmikanta K vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 April, 2022
Constitutional Amendment of 1994,
Sections 9, 65 and 72 of the Act were
amended. Prior to the amendment the co-
opted members were at par with the elected members, however, after 1994 only elected members
and members of the Legislative Assembly have a right to vote under Section 9(1) of the Act. Under
sub- section (2) of Section 65, as amended, the Chairman has to be elected by "elected members of
the Board". This change is very important. Prior to 1994, the Chairman was to be elected by the
"members of the Board", which is the phrase used in the unamended Section 65(2), as the co-opted
members had a right to vote. However, in 1994, Section 65(2) of the Act was amended and the
expression "members of the Board" in the old section is substituted by the expression "elected
members of the Board". In fact, the expression "whole number of members"
earlier appearing in Sections 65 and 72 of the Act has been deleted because in Section
65(2) it is expressly provided that the Chairman shall be elected only by elected
members of the Board from amongst themselves. Therefore, the scheme of post-1994
Act is that the Chairman/Vice-Chairman shall be elected by the elected members of
the Board and their office shall stand vacated on passing of no-confidence motion by
the elected members of the Board. The position which, therefore, emerges is that
both before and after 1994, the no-confidence motion had to be voted upon by
members who were entitled to vote. As stated above, Section 3 of the Act begins with
the words "unless the context otherwise requires". Section 3(36) defines the
expression "whole number"/"total number" to mean total number of members
holding the office at the given time. The said expression "whole number of members"
finds place in Rules 3(5), (8) and (9). Hence, we have to read Rules 3(5), (8) and (9)
in the context of the provisions of the said Act. As stated above, the basic scheme of
the Act prior to 1994 and post-1994 has remained unchanged. In both cases, the
legislative intent has been that the office of the Chairman/Vice-Chairman shall stand
vacated on passing of no-confidence motion by the members of the Board who are
entitled to vote. Hence, in our view, the expression "whole number" or "total number"
connotes the "total number of elected members".
20. Thus, the Supreme Court itself while dealing with scope and ambit of Article 243R held that the
Constitution itself makes a distinction between elected members and nominated members who play
essentially an advisory role. The elected members of the Council are chosen by popular vote and
carry with them, the mandate of the people, whereas, nominated members of the Council are
appointed as Councilors. The elected members and nominated members cannot be said to be
belonging to the same class and there is no pleading that differentiation between elected and
nominated members is either unreasonable or is arbitrary or that it does not rest on any rational
basis. In view of aforesaid enunciation of law, challenge to the validity of Article 243R (2)
(a) that it violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India, fails.

21. It is pertinent to note that there is no pleading in the writ petition as to what is the basic
structure of the Constitution and how Article 243R (2) (a) violates the basic structure of the
Constitution. In the absence of any pleading on the aforesaid aspect of the matter, the challenge to
Article 243R (2) (a) on the ground that it violates the basic structure of the Constitution deserves to
be repelled in limine. Even otherwise, the right to vote is not a fundamental right and therefore,
Article 243R (2) (a) which provides that nominated members shall not have right to vote in the
meeting of the Council does not violate the basic structure of the Constitution. Article 243R (2) (a)
does not suffer from any infirmity, therefore, the question of reading down the same does not arise.
22. Section 11(b) of the Act is in consonance with Article 243R (2) (a) of the Constitution and
therefore, for the reasons assigned in the preceding paragraph, the same cannot be termed as
unconstitutional. Section 11(b) of the Act does not suffer from any unconstitutionality and therefore,
the question of reading down the same also does not arise.
23. The contention that bar contained in proviso to Article 243R(2) does not apply to the election of
Chairperson of Municipality concerned, the same also does not deserve acceptance, as the proviso
specifically bars the nominated members who oath in the meetings of Municipality. A Conjoint
reading of Section 42(2) of the Act and Rule 3 of the Rules leaves no iota of doubt that the President
has to be elected in a meeting of the Council. Therefore, the contention that the bar which disentitles
the nominated members to vote in the meeting for election to the post of President and Vice-
President of the Council does not apply to a meeting held for election to the post of President and
Vice-President of the Council does not deserve acceptance. Similarly, the contention that Section
2(6), Section 42(2) of the Act entitles the nominated member to vote for election for the post of
President of the Council is concerned, the same deserves to be repelled in view of bar contained in
Article 243R(2) and in Section 11(1) of the Act.
24. So far as reliance placed on division bench of decision of Allahabad High Court in KHALIQUZ
ZAMAN SUPRA is concerned, suffice it to say that division bench of Allahabad High Court held that
the word 'meeting' used in Article 243R (2) (a) of the Constitution does not include a meeting held
for election, as Section 54 (1) of the UP Municipalities Act would be rendered unconstitutional.
Section 54(1) of the UP Municipalities Act provided that vice- president shall be elected from among
the elected as well as nominated members. However, in the instant case, there is no provision like
Section 54 in the Act and therefore, the aforesaid decision does not apply to the obtaining factual
matrix of the case.
25. This writ petition has been filed in pursuance of liberty granted by a learned Single Judge of this
Court, to file a fresh writ petition assailing the validity of Section 11(1)(b) of the Act. We have dealt
with issue on merits and therefore, it is not necessary for us to decide the issue with regard to
maintainability of the writ petition.
In view of preceding analysis, we do not find any merit in the writ petition. The same fails and is
hereby dismissed.
