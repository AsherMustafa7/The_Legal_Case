2. All these three appeals have been preferred against the
judgment and decree dated 14.10.1993 (hereinafter referred to as
the impugned judgment) passed in Land Acquisition Case Nos. 08
of 1990, 07 of 1990 and 10 of 1990 passed by Sub-Judge 3 rd,
Patna (hereinafter referred to as the 'learned trial court') wherein
and whereunder the learned trial court has awarded insufficient
compensation with respect to the lands and houses which were
acquired in above cases.
3. The Land Acquisition Officer, Patna has made a
reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act regarding
adjudication for the adequacy of the compensation for the lands
and houses acquired. There having common question of law and
facts of 14 cased including these cases were taken together by the
learned trial court.
4. The facts leading to these cases are that about 01 Acre
15 Dismil of land along with houses standing over the same
belonging to these awardees within the village- Mosimpur Kurtha
P.S.- Fatwah, District- Patna acquired by the State of Bihar for the
purpose of construction of approach road to Punpun bridge by a
Gazette notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act
on 16.08.1980. Date of declaration under Section 6 of the Act for
the same was on 01.07.1982 and the award of the lands and houses

were made by the Collector on 23.09.1989 and the possession of
the lands and the houses were taken on 18.05.1987 by the
Collector. The compensation money for the bhith lands and
homestead land acquired was paid to the awardees at the rate of
Rs.96,000/- per acre i.e. Rs.3,000/- only per kattha. The Collector
also paid the price of the houses to the awardees varying from
Rs.3,690/- to Rs.2,31,750/-. The Collector also paid 30% solatium
and interest on the amount of compensation to the awardees. The
awardees received compensation money so awarded under protest
to the effect that the compensation money awarded by the State of
Bihar either for the lands or for the houses standing over the same
was inadequate. Therefore, the Collector referred these cases to the
court for adjudication of the adequacy of the quantum of the
compensation.
5. According to the State of Bihar, compensation already
paid for the lands and houses standing thereon was proper and
adequate. On the other hand, the awardees have come before the
court with their respective cases that the lands of the awardees lies
within the notified area of Fatwah at the corner of the main road of
Patna-Ranchi national Highway. It is also the case of the awardees
that Land Acquisition Officer has relied upon the sale deed which
do not represent true and real market value of the lands under

acquisition and has left out the true and genuine sale deed of the
locality representing higher price. They have claimed the price of
the acquired lands at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per kattha. They have
also made out their case that the Executive Engineer of the State
has failed to take into account the correct aspect of engineering in
respect of making assessment of the value of the buildings of the
awardees. He should have taken into account while determining
the compensation of the buildings as to what would be real cost in
erecting a building similar to existing building of the awardees at
the time of notification. According to their cases, inadequate price
of their buildings has been fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer
on the basis of unscientific report of Executive Engineer. However,
the awardees have claimed the price of their respective houses
varying from Rs.50,000/- to Rs.12,95,475/-. They have also
claimed compensation for damages done for their business
premises.
Submission on behalf of the Appellants/defendants
6. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has
submitted that the learned Special Land Acquisition Judge-III has
committed error of law as also on the facts in deciding the claim of
the appellants. The learned trial court did not appreciate correctly
the pleadings of the parties, made wrong and illegal approach to
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025

the cases. It has further been submitted that the total houses of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 4
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
these awardees constructed over 0.045 acres have been acquired
by the State of Bihar and paid Rs.2,10,257 and 25 paisa only
which has been received by the appellants/defendants under
protest and they have claimed the rate of land at Rs.50,000/- per
kattha and Rs.8,11,414 for the houses. Rs.28,000/- annual for the
loss of business and Rs.90,000/- for loss of furniture and goods. It
has also been submitted that the awardees have examined
altogether 16 witnesses and they have adduced documentary
evidence, State of Bihar has not given any written submission nor
has examined any witness except OW-1, Mathura Pandey who has
only proved rate report over khatiyaan, sale statement, possession
certificate.
7. The learned trial court has not appreciated the
evidence adduced by the appellants/defendants. It has also been
submitted that the learned trial court has held at paragraph '8' of
the judgment that "the aforesaid document in support of the price
of the land determined by the State of Bihar have no evidentiary
value and as such the aforesaid documents cannot be relied upon
and in these circumstances the price of lands determined by the
State of Bihar on the basis of sale figure mentioned in column 8 of
the sale statement cannot be relied and adopted."

6/26
8. Learned trial court has relied on Ext-4/A, Sale deed of
year 1979 and according to this sale deed, the price of the land
comes to Rs.17,647/- per kattha but the learned trial court has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 5
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
wrongly fixed the price of land at Rs.7,000/- per kattha, though the
price of the land is increasing day by day. So far the price of the
double storeyed houses is concerned the learned trial court after
going through the evidence of the witnesses and the documents
held in paragraph-11 of the judgment that the evidence of AW-3 is
admissible in law. His evidence being evidence of expert. The Ext-
1/E and 2/E have been prepared by AW-3 who is expert and he has
mentioned in detailed specifications and there is no material on the
record to controvert the estimate prepared by AW-3. It has also
been submitted that all the witnesses including independent
witnesses have clearly stated that the acquired house to the newly
constructed double storeyed building and situated at Patna-Ranchi
road and Railway Station, Police station, Post-office, market
bazaar and area was near to the acquired house and the witnesses
have also stated that these awardees had business premises in the
house and the learned trial court has taken into consideration but
he has erred in deducting depreciation at the rate of 65% from the
estimate Ext-2/E.
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025
7/26
9. It has further been submitted that there is clear
evidence of AW-1 that there was well in the house but the learned
trial court has not considered this aspect of the case and has erred
in not awarding the compensation for the well. Ext-5/A is a license
of foodgrains which shows that the appellants had business in their
houses but the trial court has not awarded any compensation for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 6
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
the loss of business. Appellants have also claimed for the loss of
furniture goodwill of the firm and has further claimed the charges
on the removal of the articles but the trial court has ignored the
same. As such, it has been prayed to set aside the award of the
learned trial court.

Issues before the learned trial court
15. There were two issues before the learned trial court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 8
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
First issue :- The first issue was whether the
compensation money awarded by the State of Bihar in respect of
land is proper and adequate or it requires to be changes.
Second issue :- Second is whether the amount of
compensation paid by the Collector in respect of the house of the
awardees is proper and adequate and according to size, age and
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025
10/26
construction of the building under the acquisition. These are also
two major issued at this stage.
16. First of all, I will consider the first issue. On this
issue, oral as well as documentary evidences have been adduced
on behalf of the awardees. Witness nos. AW-1, AW-2, AW-4, AW-
5, AW-6, AW-7, AW-8, AW-10, AW-11, AW-15, AW-17, AW-19
and AW-20 are the awardees of the different cases. They have
categorically stated in their oral evidence that price of the land
should have been determined at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per kattha
with respect to the rates of the land, documentary evidence is also
available. AW-13 has stated in his evidence that he has purchased
8 and half dhurs of land in village Mosimpur Kurtha for Rs.7,500/-
in the year 1979. He has also filed tax receipt of the acquired
house of the awardees which are Ext-3 series. Awardees have also
filed certified copies of two sale deeds in support of their claim.
They have further filed Ext-5 showing that some of the awardees
were doing foodgrain business in the acquired house. Only one
witness on behalf of the State namely, Mathura Pandey has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 9
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
examined by the State who has proved the signature of Jai Shankar
Tiwary, Land Acquisition Officer on rate report vide Ext-A. He has
also proved valuation Khatiyaan prepared by one Mangal Prasad
vide Ext-B. He has further proved the sale figures prepared by one
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025
11/26
Satya Narayan Singh, Land Surveyor vide Ext-C and paper of
possession plan vide Ext-D which has been prepared by Mangal
Prasad, Surveyor and signed by Land Acquisition Officer. This
witness has also stated in his cross-examination that he has no
concern with the preparation of the aforesaid documents. He is
purely a formal witness.
17. Learned trial court has disbelieved the basis on
which the compensation has been determined by the Collector. As
the price of the land acquired has been determined solely on the
basis of only one sale deed mentioned in column-8 of the sale
statement as against average rate of all the sale deeds shown in the
sale figure regarding similar type of land to that of acquired one
has to be done and has also not accepted Ext- C and Ext- A.
18. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has
argued that from perusal of the impugned judgment it will
transpire that the learned trial court has relied on the decision of
Hon'ble Apex Court reported in AIR (1979) 472 in which their
Lordships of the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that 'mere sale
statement is not admissible in law'. Admittedly, the author of sale
rate namely, Land Acquisition Officer has not been examined in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 10
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
this case. Learned trial court has not relied upon the documents
which has been adduced by the respondents and has categorically
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025
12/26
held that sale figures mentioned in Column-8 of the sale statement
cannot be relied rather the trial court has relied on the sale deeds,
more specifically Ext-4 and Ext-4/A. Ext-4 is the sale deed dated
12.07.1976
executed by Rajmati Devi in favour of Smt. Chanda Devi under which plot Nos. 140 and 141 having
an area of 504 Sq.
ft. was sold for Rs.9,000/- which comes to Rs.24,140/- per kattha.
AW-16, Raja Mistry is the nephew of the purchaser Smt. Chanda Devi. Admittedly, the notification
of the acquisition was made in the year 1980 and this sale deed was executed in the year 1976 and
another sale deed Ext-4/A dated 16.10.1979 executed by Reshmi Devi to Smt. Sudama Devi wife of
Lal Babu Sah under which an area of 8.5 dhurs was sold for Rs.7,500/- which comes to Rs.17,647/-
per kattha. Learned trial court has not accepted the Ext-4 saying that this is of the year 1976 which is
of much earlier and has relied on Ext-4/A which is close to the date of notification of the acquisition.
The lands under the aforesaid sale deeds situates in the vicinity of the acquired lands which fact is
evident from survey map, Ext-6. Learned trial court has also held that 'it does not stand to my
reason as to why this sale deed has not been taken into consideration by the Land Acquisition
Officer. It has been simply rejected on the ground that it has been executed on Patna High Court FA
No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 competitive basis although there is no such evidence on the record, so
the aforesaid sale deed has to be considered in this case."
19. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has submitted that recently in the case of
Manohar and others vs. State of Maharashtra and Others, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in
Paragraphs 31, 38, 39 and 40 as follows :-
31. In the case of Anjani Molu Dessai (supra) this Court, while referring to two
previous decisions of this Court, held thus:
"20. The legal position is that even where there are several exemplars with reference to similar
lands, usually the highest of the exemplars, which is a bona fide transaction, will be considered.
Where however there are several sales of similar lands whose prices range in a narrow bandwidth,
the average thereof can be taken, as representing the market price. But where the values disclosed in
respect of two sales are markedly different, it can only lead to an inference that they are with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 11
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
reference to dissimilar lands or that the lower value sale is on account of undervaluation or other
price depressing reasons. Consequently, averaging cannot be resorted to. We may refer to two
decisions of this Court in this behalf.
21. In M. Vijayalakshmamma Rao Bahadur v. Collector, [(1969) 1 Mad LJ 45 (SC)], a three-Judge
Bench of this Court observed that the proper method for evaluation of market value is by taking the
highest of the exemplars and not by averaging of different types of sale transactions. This Court
held: (ML) pp. 46-47) "It seems to us that there is substance in the first ontention of Mr. Ram
Reddy. After all when the land is being compulsorily taken away from a person, he is entitled to say
that he should be given the Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 highest value which
similar land in the locality is shown to have fetched in a bona fide transaction entered into between
a willing purchaser and a willing seller near about the time of the acquisition. It is not disputed that
the transaction represented by Ext. R-19 was a few months prior to the notification under Section 4
that it was a bona fide transaction and that it was entered into between a willing purchaser and a
willing seller. The land comprised in the sale deed is 11 grounds and was sold at Rs. 1961 per ground.
The land covered by Ext. R-27 was also sold before the notification but after the land comprised in
Ext. R-19 was sold. It is true that this land was sold at Rs. 1096 per ground. This, however, is
apparently because of two circumstances. One is that betterment levy at Rs. 500 per ground had to
be paid by the vendee and the other that the land comprised in it is very much more extensive, that
is about 93 grounds or so. Whatever that may be, it seems to us to be only fair that where sale deeds
pertaining to different transactions are relied on behalf of the Government, that representing the
highest value should be preferred to the rest unless there are strong circumstances justifying a
different course. In any case we see no reason why an average of two sale deeds should have been
taken in this case."
22. In State of Punjab v. Hans Raj, [(1994) 5 SCC 734] this Court held: (SCC p. 736, para 4) "4.
Having given our anxious consideration to the respective contentions, we are of the considered view
that the learned Single Judge of the High Court committed a grave error in working out average
price paid under the sale transactions to determine the market value of the acquired land on that
basis. As the method of averaging the prices fetched by sales of different lands of different kinds at
different times, for fixing the market value of the acquired land, if followed, could bring about a
figure of price which may not at all be regarded as the price to be fetched by sale of acquired land.
One should Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 not have, ordinarily recourse to
such method. It is well settled that genuine and bona fide sale transactions in respect of the land
under acquisition or in its absence the bona fide sale transactions proximate to the point of
acquisition of the lands situated in the neighbourhood of the acquired lands possessing similar value
or utility taken place between a willing vendee and the willing vendor which could be expected to
reflect the true value, as agreed between reasonable prudent persons acting in the normal market
conditions are the real basis to determine the market value.""
(emphasis supplied)
38. Thirdly, relying on paragraph 20 of Anjani Molu Dessai (supra) which has been
reproduced hereinbefore so also paragraph 18 of Nirmal Singh (supra), the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 12
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
counsel for Respondent No. 3 (MIDC) contended that the Reference Court has rightly
used the principle of averaging of sale price of sale exemplars at Sr. Nos. 1 to 3 and 5
for determination of market value of the acquired land as the same is a well-
established principle of law laid down by this Court in several cases. For ease of
reference, paragraph 18 of Nirmal Singh (supra) is reproduced and it reads thus:
"18. Keeping in mind the guidelines laid down by this Court in the catena of cases
referred to supra, we are of the opinion to determine just and reasonable
compensation for the acquired land on the basis of the sale instances as submitted by
the appellants by taking the average of the sale considerations mentioned therein that
are relevant to the date of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act. However,
the same is to be determined keeping in mind that developmental costs are higher for
larger areas of land as compared to small portions of land. The rate of compensation
must be subject to deductions towards developmental purpose that will have to be
incurred by the respondent State."
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 (emphasis supplied)
39. Insofar as the contention of the learned counsel for Respondent No. 3 (MIDC) that the Courts
below riahtiv excluded the sale exemplar at Serial No. 4 on account of it being of an abnormally high
value is concerned, we outrightly reject the said contention.
40. It is well-settled that the compensation payable to the owner of the land is determined by
reference to the price which a seller might reasonably expect to obtain from a willing purchaser. It is
further settled law that the land acquired has to be valued not only with reference to its condition at
the time of notification under Section 4 of the LA Act but its potential value must be taken into
account. In this respect, the sale deeds of lands situated in the vicinity and the comparable benefits
and advantages which they have, provide a ready method of computing the market value.
20. As against this, the learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs has relied on the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in AIR 1977 SC 580 :: 1977 REV LR 1 as follows:-
(A) Land Acquisition Act (1 of 1894), S.23(1)-
Market value- Determination- Considerations- Land classified into potential building area and
agriculture land- Latter not also accessible- Compensation cannot be granted at the same rate as
that for potential building area.
The measure of compensation to be awarded to the owners of immovable property acquired by the
State is enshrined in Section 23 (1) of the Act which is designed to award just and fair compensation
for the acquisition. According to this provision, compensation has to be awarded on the basis of the
market value prevalent on the date of the publication of the notification under Section 4 (1) of the
Act. The said market rate Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 must be determined
by reference to the price which a willing vendor might reasonable expect to obtain from a willing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 13
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
purchaser. For ascertaining the market rate the court can rely upon such transactions which would
afford a guide to fix the price. Price paid for a land acquired within a reasonable time from the date
of acquisition of the land in question would certainly be the best piece of evidence. Price paid for a
land possessing advantages similar to those of the land acquired in or about the time of notification
will also supply the date for assessment of compensation.
In case where the land sought to be acquired was classified into two categories namely a potential
building area and agricultural lands and apart from the fact that the land which fell within the
second category was situate in the rear away from habitation it suffered from two other drawbacks
in that it was not accessible from either side of the two roads and there are no roads therein. Held
that the owners cannot be justifiably granted compensation for the agricultural land at the rate
determined in respect of the potential building area which possessed far greater advantages.
(B) Land Acquisition Act (1 of 1894) S.23(1)- Compensation- Determination- Value fetched for small
plots cannot be applied to lands covering a large extent.
AIR 1971 SC 2015, Ref.
(Para 8)
8. The contention of counsel for the appellants in the aforesaid two appeals that they should have at
least been awarded compensation for the potential building area at the rate prevalent in Gopalnagar
in 1958-59 cannot also be acceded to. A glance at the chart of the acquisitions which appears at page
85 of the Paper Book shows that the sales were of very small plots of land. In seven transactions out
of eight to which our attention has been invited, the land Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994
dt.14-10-2025 acquired was below 200 sq. yds. and in the eighth transaction, it was 250 sq yds. It is
also well settled that in determining compensation the value fetched for small plots of land cannot
be applied to the lands covering a very large extent and that the large area of land cannot possibly
fetch a price at the same rate at which small plots are sold. (See Collector of Lakhimpur v.
Bhuban Chandra Dutta (AIR 1971 SC 2015). All the three contentions advanced on behalf of the
claimants of compensation, therefore, fail.
21. Learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs has also relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court reported in AIR 1977 SC 1560 :: 1977 REV LR 290 as follows:-
(B) Land Acquisition Act (1 of 1894) S.23, S.54- Determination of compensation
-Market value, meaning of- Appeal against judgment of High Court- Interference by
Supreme Court.
S. 23 of the Land Acquisition Act provides that in determining the amount of compensation to be
awarded for the land acquired under the Act, the Court shall take into account inter alia the market
value of the land at the date of the publication of the notification under S. 4 of the Act. The market
value means the price that a willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller for the property, having

Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
due regard to its existing condition with all its existing advantages and its potential possibilities
when laid out in the most advantageous manner excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of
the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired. In considering market value the
disinclination of the vendor to part with his land and the Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994
dt.14-10-2025 urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy should be disregarded. There is an element
of guess-work inherent in most cases involving determination of the market value of the acquired
land. But this in the very nature of things cannot be helped. The essential thing is to keep in view the
relevant factors prescribed by the Act. If the judgment of the High Court reveals that it has taken
into consideration the relevant factors, the assessment of the market value of the acquired land
should not be disturbed.
22. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has held that though the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has held in Paragraph '31' of the judgment in the case of Manohar and Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra
(supra) that the legal position is that even where there are several exemplars with respect to similar
lands, usually the highest of the exemplars which is bona fide transaction, will be considered.
Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has further submitted that even from the judgment
of the trial court it is clear that learned trial court has considered Ext-4/A according to which the
consideration money of Ext.-4/A comes to Rs.17,647/-
per kattha and has also considered that the lands are very close to the lands under acquisition and
has also considered that the lands are situated on the roadside and has got commercial value.
23. Learned trial court has also recorded that it is also our common experience that the valuation of
the land is increasing day by day. So, it is proper to compute the valuation of the lands Patna High
Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 on the basis of the sale deed executed in respect of the lands
at or about the time of issuing notification. Admittedly, the lands in question of these awardees are
homestead lands, so there is no justification for the State of Bihar in awarding compensation money
for the homestead land to the awardees at the rate of Rs.3,000/- per kattha rate. As such, the trial
court was of the opinion that the price of the lands acquired should be enhance to more than these
amounts. Despite holding all this, learned trial court has assumed a rate of Rs.7,000/- per kattha to
be the proper price of the acquisition land. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has
submitted this Rs.7,000/- per kattha rate which has been fixed by the learned trial court for the
compensation is without any basis. During course of argument, even the learned counsel for the
respondents/plaintiff could not advance any argument as to on what basis this Rs.7,000/- per
kattha has been fixed as rate of the acquired lands.
24. Admittedly, there were two sale deeds, Ext-4 and Ext-4/A. Ext-4 was not accepted by the trial
court on the ground that it was executed four years before the notification and has only considered
Ext-4/A for the fixing the price of the land. According to Ext-4/A the price of the land would come to
Rs.17,647/- per kattha. So as the learned trial court has considered and accepted Patna High Court
FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 Ext-4/A, I do not find any reason and even the learned counsel for
the respondents has also not been able to show any reason as to why Ext-4/A should not be
considered and accepted. As such, the sale price which has been described in Ext-4/A which comes
to Rs.17,647/- per kattha should be the rate per kattha of the acquired land which comes to Rs.

Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
17,647 per kattha, i.e. Rs.17647x32= Rs.5,64,704/- only per acres will be the rate for awarding
compensation to the awardees.
25. In view of Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, interest at the rate of 9% per annum
shall also be paid to the awardees from the date on which the Collector took the possession of the
land till the date of payment of excess amount.
26. Second point for consideration before this Court is regarding the compensation with respect to
building. Learned trial court has held that admittedly, there were buildings of the awardees on the
acquired land under village Mosimpur Kurtha which have been acquired by the State of Bihar. Price
fixed in respect of the houses of the awardees by the State of Bihar, respective claimants of the
awardees ans estimate by the private consultant engineer is annexed:-
L.A. Case Price fixed by Claim of the Estimate made by the No. the Collector
awardees consultant engineer 7 of 1990 Rs.1,54,900/- 11,00,000/- 6,89,213/- 8 of
1990 Rs.99,255/- 8,11,414/- 4,70,000/-
Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025 10 of 1990 Rs.1,24,480/- 9,39,280/- 5,51,332/-
27. Learned trial court has held that the houses and its valuation prepared by Executive engineer on
behalf of the State of Bihar but neither the Executive engineer has come to support the valuation
entry as mentioned in Ext-B. Even Land Acquisition Officer has not come to substantiate it. The
basis on which the valuation of the house has been fixed by the Collector is lacking in this case and
the learned trial court has further opined that the valuation made by the Collector cannot be relied
on. As far as the case of the awardees is concerned, they have come before the court as a witness and
they have been given a specification of their case in their respective defence. It is also admitted that
the acquired building is situated within the notified area of Fatwah and was on roadside. This fact
has been supported by the independent witness AW-9, AW-12 and AW-18. It is also the case of the
awardees that they had business premises in their house. This fact has also been stated by the
witnesses. There is also evidence that most of the houses were mosaic and well maintained. Learned
counsel for the appellants/defendants has submitted that the awardees have been uprooted from
their houses and they are on road. It has been argued that the price of construction of the material is
going high day by day. As such, sufficient compensation amount was Patna High Court FA No.322 of
1994 dt.14-10-2025 demanded by them, so that they may settle or construct their houses in similar
area.
28. Learned trial court has examined the evidence of consultation engineer who has been examined
as AW-3 by the awardees and in his evidence he has stated that he has prepared the map of the
house and estimate as well as of the awardees. He has proved the map and estimate vide Ext-1 and 2
series. No doubt it has come in his evidence that no government official was present at the time of
measurement and verification made by him. This witness has also stated that he has submitted the
estimate of material of the house of year 1983 for the acquisition of the house in question was made
in year 1980. Age of different houses acquired has also not been assessed by this witness. Learned
trial court has further held that the depreciation as given in the case by the engineer does not fit with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150749980/ 16
Ram Chandra Sao vs The State Of Bihar on 25 September, 2025
the circumstances of the case.
29. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has argued that the learned trial court has opined
that 65% deduction as estimate submitted by the engineer in the cases of awardees will meet the
ends of justice and this will be proper valuation of the house of the awardees including the damages
for their business, if any. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendatns has submitted that in any
stretch of imagination it cannot be concluded that 65% Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994
dt.14-10-2025 of the depreciation is proper. Though the houses were acquired in the year 1980 and
the consultant engineer has given his report has stated that he has submitted the estimate of
materials of the house of year 1983. It means there is difference of three years in the rate of the
construction materials. Learned counsel for the appellants/defendants has also submitted that not
only they have been uprooted from the house but they have also lost their goodwill which they have
earned through their businesses from their house. So it has been submitted that the depreciation at
the rate of 65% is arbitrary.
30. Learned counsel for the respondents has argued that there are rules for depreciation which he
will brought before Court after obtaining it from Municipal Corporation but despite being given
sufficient opportunity, he was not able to produce the documents regarding rules of depreciation.
31. I am of the view that the depreciation of 65% is arbitrary. Normally the life of a house is
estimated at 50 years. In that circumstance, depreciation per year will be not more than 2%.
Since the estimation which was submitted by the consultant engineer was of 1983, so at most 6%
may be regarded as depreciation cost. It is also a case of the awardees that they had businesses in
their houses and it is the duty of the State to Patna High Court FA No.322 of 1994 dt.14-10-2025
adequately compensate the awardees so that they may be restored into their position which they had
before acquisition of their land and house.
32. As the awardees have been uprooted from their house, they have to construct their new houses
and they will have to spend more than the estimated cost of the materials of the house. So, in my
view the damages for their reconstruction and business, if any, should be at least 10% of the
estimated cost of the consultant engineer. As there is no other evidence on the record, this Court has
got no option than to accept the report of the consultant engineer.
33. As such, the compensation with respect to the houses of awardees will be calculated in view of
the discussions made hereinabove.
34. In view of aforesaid discussions, I am of the view that the learned trial court has arbitrarily
decided the compensation and his conclusion was not based on the materials available on the
record. The amount which he has determined for compensation was based merely on assumption
without any document.
35. As such, considering above facts and circumstances of the case, the judgment and decree of the
learned trial court is set aside and in result, these appeals are allowed.
