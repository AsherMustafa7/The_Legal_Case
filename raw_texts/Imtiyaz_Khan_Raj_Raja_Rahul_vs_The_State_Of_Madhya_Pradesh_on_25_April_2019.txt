Khan and Smt. Shobhna Sharma,
learned Amicus Curiae.
For Respondents: Shri H.S. Chhabra,
learned Government Advocate
Law laid down (1) Conviction under Section 395 of
I.P.C. is permissible only when
ingredients of Section 391 of I.P.C. are
fulfilled.
(2) Section 120-B of I.P.C.- Merely
because certain stolen articles were
recovered from the accused, they
cannot be held to be dacoits by
invoking presumption unless there is
recent recovery from them.
Possession of stolen property is an
evidence of stolen property and in
absence of any other evidence, it is
not safe to draw an inference that the
persons possessing the stolen
property were involved in the crime,
as the suspicion cannot take place of
proof.

found it open and there was darkness in the bank. On entering into the bank, he found two boys
sitting inside the bank and he did not find any of the bank employees except Cashier Ramavatar
Sharma (PW/4). Just then, Girish Mishra (PW/9) entered into the bank for depositing an amount of

employee of the bank namely Arjun Singh Badanga (PW/8) also reached there. The intruders while
putting Baka over the neck of Sharad Kumar Rakesh, compelled him to open the strong room and
on the same being done, took away a total amount of Rs.22,80,000/- in four plastic bags. They also
snatched an amount of Rs.1,21,000/- from Girish Mishra. Thus, total amount of Rs.24,01,000/- was
looted. Thereafter, they locked Sharad Kumar, Ramavatar Sharma, Arjun Singh and Girish Mishra
in the strong room itself. The two of the accused had cut the telephone as well as light connection of
the bank. The third accused kept the other bank employees quiet and motionless at gun point giving

witnesses Ramavatar, Arjun Singh, Ghanshyam and Girish Mishra identified the accused Sultan.
Two witnesses could not attend the Test Identification Parade on 29.11.2005, therefore, it was again
conducted on 02.12.2005 and they have also identified the accused Sultan. Again on 19.06.2006,
Test Identification Parade was conducted, in which Sharad Kumar (PW/1), Ramavatar Sharma
(PW/4) and Girish Mishra (PW/9) have identified Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 accused Naushad, but they did not identify Imtiyaz, whereas,
Prashant and Ram Kumar have identified Imtiyaz, but they did not identify Naushad. Three accused
were identified namely Sultan, Imtiyaz and Naushad. In the statement recorded under Section 313
of Cr.P.C., all the accused persons have simply denied the charges and pleaded their false
implication. The accused Rani Singh has also denied the seizure of gold articles seized from her
possession as they did not belong to her, but those were belonging to her mother. In support of her
contention, she got examined her mother Laxmi Devi (DW/1), who stated that her husband had
retired in the year 1996 who was serving in Raulkela Steel Plant and at the time of his retirement, he
received double of the amount of Rs.2,30,730/-. He also received funds under different heads
towards retiral dues and that some ancestral property was also sold and Rs.2,50,000/- were
received therefrom. She also stated that the seized ornaments were received in her marriage.
10. During trial, the prosecution examined as many as 41 witnesses whereas in defence, only one
witness namely Laxmi Devi (DW/1) was examined.
11. On the basis of statement of Anand Rai (PW/10), Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 Sultan alongwith his other four friends had stayed in the lodge till
22.11.2004 i.e. on the date when dacoity was committed, corroborating the entries shown in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 5
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
register of Nagaud Lodge, presence of five persons has been established.
12. The trial Court after appreciating the evidence and on the basis of statement of witnesses, seized
articles and other material, arrived at a conclusion that except Zamaluddin, all other accused
persons were also involved in the dacoity and accordingly convicted them. Sheikh Israil @ Gudda,
Mohd. Sadab, Afzal Ahmad Khan, Kailash Singh @ Guddu, Musammi @ Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit,
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj @ Raja @ Rahul and Sultan were convicted under Section 395/120-B,
sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default of payment of fine, further R.I.
for six months. Ku. Rani Singh and Mirza Irshad Beg were convicted under Section 412 of the I.P.C.
and sentenced to R.I. for five years and fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default, further R.I. for six months.
Sheikh Israil @ Gudda and Afzal Ahmad Khan have also been convicted under Section 25(1B)(a) of
the Arms Act and sentenced to R.I. for two years and fine of Rs.1,000/-and in default, further R.I.
for two months.
13. As per the arguments advanced by learned counsel Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 for the appellants it was stated that on the basis of the material
produced by the prosecution and evidence recorded, no case of dacoity is made out as the trial Court
although very specifically observed that the loot committed by Musammi @ Naushad @ Rinku @
Rohit, Imtiyaaz Khan @ Raj @ Raja @ Rahul and Sultan, further no evidence against the other
accused is available that they entered into the bank but on the basis of recovery of stolen articles,
presumption has been drawn that they were part of the conspiracy of dacoity and standing outside
the bank. Although, in paragraph-74 of the judgment, the trial Court itself has observed that there
was no direct evidence about the conspiracy. The learned counsel for the appellants submit that
merely because articles were seized from the appellants that too after 3 to 4 months, presumption
cannot be invoked that they were also dacoits. They submit that as per Section 114 of the Evidence
Act, suspicion cannot take place of strict proof unless there is evidence to connect the accused with
the incident directly but only on the basis of seizure of the stolen property, no inference about their
involvement in the crime could be drawn. It is further contended by them that in the statement
recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. giving no explanation Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007,
839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 about the stolen property, cannot be used against the
accused, unless specific circumstance put to them. It is further argued that Section 27 of the
Evidence Act is also not admissible. Instead it is a case of robbery and accordingly, the conviction
under Section 395 of the I.P.C. is not proper as the ingredients of Section 391 of the I.P.C. are
missing. As per their contention, punishment at the most could be given under Section 393 of the
I.P.C. They have also contended that the prosecution has failed to produce any material to make out
a case even under Section 120-B of the I.P.C. and as such, they assailed the conviction of the
appellants as the same is illegal, perverse and excessive. It is further contended by them that
considering the period of custody of the accused persons, they can also be considered to be released
taking cognizance of the undergone period. To bolster their contentions, they have relied upon
various decisions reported in AIR 1980 SC 1753 [Nagappa Dondiba Kalal Vs. State of Karnataka],
AIR 2012 SC 493 [Sherimon Vs. State of Kerala], AIR 1984 SC 1622 [Sharad Birdhi Chand Sarda Vs.
State of Maharashtra], AIR 1993 Cr. Law J. 3669 [Man Singh and another Vs. State of MP], AIR

14. Per contra, the learned Government Advocate appearing for the respondent/State submits that
there is no perversity and illegality in the impugned judgment. He submits that as per the evidence
produced by the prosecution and the memorandum and seizure made from the accused, it is rightly
presumed by the trial Court that they are connected with the crime and had committed dacoity. The
learned Government Advocate submits that in absence of sufficient explanation under the statement
of Section 313 of the Cr.P.C., presumption can be drawn against the accused regarding their
involvement in the crime.
15. The facts of the present case are analyzed in the light of the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and also taken note of the law laid-down by the Apex Court as well as by the
other Courts relied upon by the parties.
16. Admittedly, the appellants were arrested after 3 to 4 months of the incident and recovery of the
stolen currency and Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011
other articles have also been made from them on the basis of their memorandum. The incident
occurred on 22.11.2004 and the first arrest was made on 21.03.2005 of accused Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj
@ Raja @ Rahul and Kailash Singh @ Guddu only on the basis of information given by the Almoda
Police. Another incident took place on 15.01.2005 in Almoda, in which, the accused Musammi @
Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit was arrested and had disclosed regarding his involvement in a dacoity
committed in Dena Bank Branch, Adhartal, Jabalpur on 22.11.2004.
17. As per the statement of Sharad Kumar Rakesh (PW/1) who was the-then Bank Manager of Dena
Bank, Anand Nagar Branch, Adhartal, Jabalpur and identification of Sultan and Musammi @
Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit in Test Identification Parade, Prashant Kumar Vishwakarma (PW/2),
the bank employee, who was also present at the time of incident, also identified one i.e. Imtiyaz
Khan @ Raj @ Raja @ Rahul and Ramavatar Sharma (PW/4), who was the-then cashier of the bank
and was present at the time of incident and has also identified Sultan and Musammi @ Naushad @
Rinku @ Rohit, further stating about presence of two accused. Ghanshyam Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007,
824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 Vishwakarma (PW/6) who was also a bank
employee present at the time of incident, has also identified Sultan and stated in paragraph-2 of his
statement that there were three accused present in the bank and committed robbery. Similarly,
Girish Mishra (PW/9) who went to bank for depositing an amount of Rs.1,21,000/- was also looted,
who identified the accused Sultan and Musammi @ Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit. Apart from this,
there is no evidence brought on record to indicate that except these three persons, any other accused
was available on the spot or even standing outside the bank.
18. The learned counsel for the appellants submit that when there was specific observation made by
the trial Court that only three persons entered into the bank and committed dacoity and has further
observed that there is no direct evidence linking the other accused to be involved in the conspiracy
of dacoity, no case under Section 395 of the I.P.C. is made out as the ingredients of Section 391 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 7
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
the I.P.C. are not attracted which is as under:-
391. Dacoity.- When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a
robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting
to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission or attempt,
amount to five or more, every person so committing, Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007,
824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 attempting or aiding, is said
to commit "dacoity".
The learned counsel for the appellants further submit that in view of Section 391, in the present
case, the ingredients of dacoity are not fulfilled. As per their contention, there is no evidence
brought on record by the prosecution to show that the incident has been committed by five or more
persons. There was no incriminating material that other accused were involved in the conspiracy. So
far as the seizure is concerned, that is a subsequent stage of the crime and, therefore, only on the
basis of seizure, it cannot be said that the persons from whom seizure is made, conjointly committed
or attempted to commit a robbery.
19. From a perusal of the record and considering the evidence collected by the prosecution, there is
no material available on record to connect that there was any conspiracy between the accused who
entered into the bank and the other accused from whom the seizure was made. It is evident that the
trial Court, only on the basis of seizure and in absence of sufficient explanation under Section 313
presumed their involvement in the crime and as such, found that it is an offence under Section 395
of the I.P.C. All the seizure witnesses have Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007,
1140/2007 & 783/2011 turned hostile and Anand Rai (PW/10) identified only Sultan and no other
appellants.
20. Appreciating the law on which the appellants have placed reliance in the case of Nagappa
Dondiba Kalal (supra), the Supreme Court in paragraph Nos.3 and 4 has observed that recovery of
ornaments at the instance of the accused and drawing an inference that he must have been involved
in the crime especially when there is no other evidence available to connect him with such crime, he
is liable to be punished under Section 411 of the I.P.C., but not the offence committed i.e. murder.
The Supreme Court has further observed that in such circumstance, presumption under Section 114
of the Evidence Act cannot be invoked to hold the accused guilty of an offence except an offence of
Section 411. The relevant paragraphs 3 and 4 are being reproduced hereinbelow:-
3. We have gone through the judgment of the High Court and we find ourselves in
complete agreement with the holding that the identity of the ornaments recovered at
the instance of the appellant which belonged to the deceased Pashyabi had been fully
established. It was also proved that she had been wearing these ornaments when she
left the house on the night of 10-4-1973. The recoveries were made on 13-4-1973 that
is to say within three days of the occurrence. P. Ws.7, 8, 16 and 17 who are close
relations of the deceased and who had full opportunity to see her wearing these
ornaments and have identified the ornaments. Their Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007,
824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 evidence is further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 8
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
corroborated by two goldsmiths P .Ws. 9 and 10 who had prepared those ornaments.
In these circumstances, therefore, the High Court was fully justified in acting on the evidence of
these witnesses and in rejecting the argument of the accused that as no test identification parade
was held, the identity could not be established. Taking, however, the evidence as it stands, there is
nothing to connect the appellant with the murder of the deceased or even with any assault the
accused may have committed on the deceased or having robbed her of her ornaments. At the utmost
as the ornaments have been proved to be stolen property received by the appellant knowing that
they were stolen property, the accused can thus be convicted on the basis of presumption under
Section 114 of the Evidence Act and under Sec. 411 of the Indian Penal Code as a receiver of stolen
property knowing the same to be stolen.
4. Counsel appearing for the State submitted that as the accused had given no explanation,
therefore, the inference should be drawn that he must have murdered the deceased. We are,
however, unable to draw any such inference. It is for the prosecution to prove its case affirmatively
and it cannot gain any strength from the conduct of the accused in remaining silent. In these
circumstances, we do not find any evidence to support the conviction of the appellant under Section
302 or under Section 394 but having regard to the evidence led by the prosecution, a case under
Section 411 of I.P.C. has been clearly made out. We, therefore, allow this appeal to this extent that
the appellant is acquitted of the charges under Sections 302 and 394 but is convicted of the minor
offence of Section 411, I.P.C. and sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of
Rs.5,000 (Rupees five thousand only) in default one year's rigorous imprisonment.
21. The learned counsel for the appellants have also relied upon a case of Man Singh (supra) in
which, the Supreme Court in paragraph Nos.7 and 8 has observed that the presumption of dacoity
against the accused can be invoked only Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007,
1140/2007 & 783/2011 when the possession of the articles are recent. Accused arrested after 3 to 4
months cannot be held to be dacoits merely because certain stolen articles recovered from them,
they are liable to be convicted under Section 412 of the I.P.C. for receiving stolen property. The
relevant paragraph Nos.7 and 8 are being reproduced hereinbelow:-
7. However, the recoveries are duly effected and the Sub-Inspector as well as the
witnesses spoke about the same. Merely because certain stolen articles were
recovered from the accused they cannot be held to be dacoits by invoking the
presumption unless there is a recent possession. In this case admittedly, there is a
lapse of nearly three or four months. In these circumstances, we think it would be
safe particularly when they were acquitted by the trial Court to convict them only for
the offence of being in possession of the stolen property.
8. A serious dacoity took place and must be known to all the people in the village as
well as in the surrounding places. The accused who were found to be in possession of
the stolen property which are the subject matter of the dacoity would be held liable
under Section 412, I.P.C. In the result the convictions of Narayan Singh and Shiv
Ratan in Crl.

A. No.573/83 under Sections 395/397, 396, 449, I.P.C., and the sentence of ten years' rigorous
imprisonment under each count are set aside.
Instead they are convicted under Section 412, I.P.C. and each of them is sentenced to three years'
rigorous imprisonment. With regards the appellants Man Singh and Rati Ram in Criminal Appeal
No.623/84 their convictions under Sections 395/397, 396 and 449, I.P.C. and the sentence of ten
years' rigorous imprisonment awarded under each count are set aside. Instead they are convicted
under Section 412, I.P.C., and each of them is sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment. The
conviction of Rati Ram under Section 25 read with Section 27 of the Arms Act and the sentence
awarded thereunder are confirmed. The conviction of Mithlesh one of the appellants in Crl. A.
No.573/83 Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 under
Section 412, I.P.C. is confirmed and the sentence is reduced to three years' rigorous imprisonment.
His acquittal under Section 216, I.P.C. is confirmed. Sentences are directed to run concurrently.
22. In the case of Sherimon (supra), the Supreme Court has observed that for committing an offence
under Section 120- B, there must be meeting of minds resulting in a decision taken by conspirators
regarding commission of crime. In the present case, there is only one evidence produced by the
prosecution i.e. Anand Rai (PW/10) for substantiating that there were more than five persons stayed
in the Nagaud Lodge and as such, there were meeting of minds among the accused before
committing robbery, but that evidence is not sufficient to make out a case of Section 120-B
especially when Anand Rai (PW/10) had identified only one of the accused namely Sultan. Had
Anand Rai (PW/10) identified the other accused, situation would have been different and in that
circumstance, an offence under Section 120-B could have been made out.
23. The appellants have also relied upon a case of Reechho Hemraj (supra) in which, the Division
Bench of the High Court has observed that to bring home the charges under Sections 395 and 391,
the accused must be shown to have Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007,
1140/2007 & 783/2011 conjointly committed robbery. It is further observed that mere presence of
an accused amongst the robbers is not sufficient to hold him guilty of dacoity. He must be shown to
have conjointly committed robbery or aiding such commission.
24. The learned counsel for the appellants submit that in the present case, there is no evidence
brought on record to show that except three accused identified, any other accused/appellants have
aided by any means in commission of offence. They submit that Section 391 of the I.P.C. defines
"dacoity" and as per the definition "persons present and aiding such commission or attempting,
amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit
dacoity". The learned counsel for the appellants further submit that aiding must be prior to or at the
time of commission of offence. As per Section 107 of the I.P.C. which describes the word aiding in
the following manner:-
"Intentionally aids by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing and as per
explanation 2 who ever, either prior to or at the time of commission of an act does
anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act and thereby facilitate the
commission thereof, is said to doing of that act."

Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
It also makes it clear that for fulfilling the ingredient as contained in Section 391 of the I.P.C., a
person has to aid in such Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 &
783/2011 commission prior to or at the time of commission of an act. Here in this case, there is
nothing produced by the prosecution to show that except three identified persons who entered into
the bank, others have in any manner aided something in commission of an act of dacoity.
25. The appellants have also relied upon the case of Sheo Nath (supra) in which the Supreme Court
has observed that recovery of cloth, stolen in dacoity after three days of occurrence, other stolen
articles not recovered from an accused, his name not mentioned as one of the participants in
dacoity, either by any of witnesses, no evidence that the said accused knew about dacoity. The only
presumption that could have been drawn that the goods were stolen but not in dacoity and as such,
conviction is permissible only under Section 411 but not under Section 396. The learned counsel for
the appellants submit that in the present case also, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to
indicate that any of the appellants, from whom the articles have been seized, must have been aware
about the fact that the same related to the dacoity.
26. The learned counsel for the appellants further relied upon the case of Sanwat Khan (supra) in
which the Apex Court Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 &
783/2011 has observed that possession of the stolen property is an evidence of stolen property and
in absence of any other evidence, it is not safe to draw an inference that the person possessing the
stolen property was involved in the crime; suspicion cannot take place of proof. As per the law
laid-down by the Bombay High Court in case of Chavadappa Pujari (supra), wherein it is observed
by the Court that where a person is merely found in possession of property which is recently stolen
in dacoity, it does not necessarily lead to the presumption that he is guilty of offence under Section
412. At the most, presumption could be drawn for lower offence i.e. under Section 411.
27. The Learned counsel for the appellants further placing reliance upon the case of Sharad Birdhi
Chand Sarda (supra), have contended that if a specific circumstance is not put to the accused in his
statement of under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. then such circumstance cannot be used against him.
The learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that from a perusal of statement of the
accused/appellants, it is clear that there is no specific question put to them whether they were aware
of the fact that the seized articles recovered from them Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 were stolen property of dacoity or not and as such, in absence of
any specific question, no presumption can be drawn against the accused.
28. The Learned counsel for the appellants further submit that Section 27 of the Evidence Act deals
with discovered facts and only that information is required to be proved and any confession made by
an accused in custody if not related to the fact thereby discovered, is not admissible. The learned
counsel for the appellants further submitted that as far as the accused Mohd. Sadab is concerned, a
seizure i.e. Article 'S' was also made from him and the said Article 'S' contains description of the
amount which was to be deposited in the bank by Girish Mishra (PW/9), an employee of B.M.
Katthal Petrol-Pump having an account in Dena Bank and the trial Court found sufficient proof to
hold Mohd. Sadab guilty of dacoity. The learned counsel for the appellants submit that as per the
evidence, said Article 'S' was written by the Manager of B.M. Katthal Petrol-Pump and he was not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 11
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
examined and nobody has proved such slip i.e. Article 'S' containing details of amount, therefore,
drawing presumption against the accused Mohd. Sadab is also not proper.
29. The learned Government Advocate submits that the Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 trial Court has not committed any illegality in holding the
appellants guilty under Sections 395 and 120-B of the I.P.C. because the Supreme Court in series of
cases has held that in absence of sufficient explanation in the statement of 313 by the accused
regarding stolen articles, presumption of involvement of the accused in the crime can be drawn. He
further submitted that the accused, except adducing one witness i.e. Laxmi Devi (DW/1), the mother
of Ku. Rani Singh, have neither adduced any evidence to explain as to how they received the stolen
property nor they have given any explanation in the statement recorded under Section 313. As such,
the trial Court has rightly convicted them under Sections 395 and 120-B of the I.P.C. In support of
his contention, he has placed reliance upon the Supreme Court decision in case of Shivappa Vs.
State of Mysore reported in AIR 1971 SC 196 wherein the Apex Court has upheld the conviction of
accused under Section 395 of the I.P.C. with the aid of Section 114 of the Evidence Act when the sole
evidence against them was possession of the stolen property. The relevant paragraph of the said
judgment is reproduced hereinbelow:-
"In our opinion, the law advocated by Mr. Chari is not correct. If there is other
evidence, to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding Cr.
A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 of the
stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the
crime. There is then no question of presumption. The evidence strengthens the other
evidence already against him. It is only when the accused cannot be connected with
the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime that the presumption
may be drawn. In what circumstances the one presumption or the other may be
drawn, it is not necessary to state categorically in this case. It all depends upon the
circumstances under which the discovery of the fruits of crime are made with a
particular accused. It has been stated on more than one occasion that if the gap of
time is, too large, the presumption that the accused was concerned with the crime
itself gets weakened. The presumption is stronger when the discovery of the fruits of
crime is made immediately after the crime is. committed. The reason is obvious.
Disposal of the fruits of crime requires the finding of a person ready to receive them
and the shortness of time, the nature of the property which is disposed of, that is to
say, its quantity and its character determine whether the person who had the goods
in his possession received them from another or was himself the thief or the dacoit.
In some cases there may be other elements which may point to the way as to how the
presumption may be drawn."
Similarly, in case of Lachhman Ram Vs. State of Orissa reported in AIR 1985 SC 486, conviction was
upheld under Section 395 of the I.P.C. solely on the ground that the stolen articles were recovered
on the memorandum of the accused.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 12
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
30. Insofar as the above referred cases i.e. Shivappa (supra) and Lachhman Ram (supra) are
concerned, they are different on facts as the accused were arrested immediately after the incident
and the stolen currency notes have also been Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 recovered from the accused on their memorandum so they have
been convicted under Section 395.
31. In a case of Ganesh Lal Vs. State of Rajasthan, reported in 2002 (1) SCC 731, the Supreme Court
has also considered the importance of statement of Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. and has also observed
as to when presumption against the accused can be drawn under Section 114 of the Evidence Act.
The relevant paragraph is being reproduced hereinbelow:-
"12. "Section 114 of the Evidence Act provides that the court may presume the
existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the
common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in
their relation to facts of the particular case. Illustration (a) provides that a man who
is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft may be presumed by the court to
be either the thief or one who has received the goods knowing them to be stolen,
unless he can account for his possession. The presumption so raised is one of fact
rather than of law. In the facts and circumstances of a given case relying on the
strength of the presumption the court may dispense with direct proof of certain such
facts as can be safely presumed to be necessarily existing by applying the logic and
wisdom underlying Section 114. Where offences, more than one, have taken place as
part of one transaction, recent and unexplained possession of property belonging to
the deceased may enable a presumption being raised against the accused that he is
guilty not only of the offence of theft or dacoity but also of other offences forming
part of that transaction.
15. A review of several decisions of this Court, some of which we have cited
hereinabove, leads to the following statement of law. Recovery of stolen property
from the Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 &
783/2011 possession of the accused enables a presumption as to commission of
offence other than theft or dacoity being drawn against the accused so as to hold him
a perpetrator of such other offences on the following tests being satisfied: (i) the
offence of criminal misappropriation, theft or dacoity relating to the articles
recovered from the possession of the accused and such other offences can reasonably
be held to have been committed as an integral part of the same transaction;
(ii) the time-lag between the date of commission of the offence and the date of
recovery of articles from the accused is not so wide as to snap the link between
recovery and commission of the offence; (iii) availability of some piece of
incriminating evidence or circumstance, other than mere recovery of the articles,
connecting the accused with such other offence; (iv) caution on the part of the court
to see that suspicion, howsoever strong, does not take the place of proof. In such
cases the explanation offered by the accused for his possession of the stolen property
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 13
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
assumes significance. Ordinarily the purpose of Section 313 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure is to afford the accused an opportunity of offering an explanation of
incriminating circumstances appearing in prosecution evidence against him. It is not
necessary for the accused to speak and explain. However, when the case rests on
circumstantial evidence the failure of the accused to offer any satisfactory
explanation for his possession of the stolen property though not an incriminating
circumstance by itself would yet enable an inference being raised against him because
the fact being in the exclusive knowledge of the accused it was for him to have offered
an explanation which he failed to do."
Considering the legal position enumerated above and considering the facts of the present case, it is
clear that Hon'ble the Apex Court even in case of Shivappa (supra), Lachhman Ram (supra) and also
in Ganesh Lal (supra) has observed that presumption can be drawn against the accused if there is no
Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 sufficient
explanation given by them about the stolen property found in their possession. But in all these cases,
it is clear that the arrest was made soon after the incident and accordingly, seizures were made. As
per the case i.e. Man Singh (supra) relied upon by the appellants in which the Supreme Court has
observed that presumption that the accused are dacoits can be drawn against them on the basis of
stolen articles recovered from them, when arrest is made soon after the incident, however in case,
the accused were arrested after 3 to 4 months, the Supreme Court has said that such presumption
cannot be drawn.
32. Now considering the facts of the present case, admittedly as per the arrest memo, the arrest has
been made after almost 3 to 4 months of the incident and there is no other evidence available on
record as to show that the appellants other than three who have been identified had entered into the
bank and were involved in the crime or were involved in hatching the conspiracy and as such, we
find substance in the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellants.
33. The view taken by the Apex Court in the case of Shivappa (supra), gives strength to the
contention raised by the Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 &
783/2011 learned counsel for the appellants as the Supreme Court has observed as under:-
"If there is other evidence to connect an accused with the crime of dacoity itself,
however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence
which connects him further with the crime. There is then no question of
presumption. The evidence strengthens the other evidence already against him. It is
only when the accused cannot be connected with the crime except by reason of
possession of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn. In what
circumstances the one presumption or the other may be drawn depends upon the
circumstances under which the discovery of the fruits of crime are made with a
particular accused. If the gap of time is too large, the presumption that the accused
was concerned with the crime itself gets weakened. The presumption is stronger
when the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the crime is
committed. The reason is obvious. Disposal of the fruits of crime requires the finding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 14
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
of a person ready to receive them and the shortness of time, the nature of the
property which is disposed of, that is to say, its quantity and its character determine
whether the person who had the goods in his possession received them from another
or was himself the thief or the dacoit. In some cases there may be other elements
which may point to the way as to how the presumption may be drawn. They differ
from case to case.
The goods stolen were a large quantity of cloth taken for sale to the market. Those
goods were not sold and were being taken back to the dealers by the cartmen. A large
number of persons said to be 20 in number pelted stones at the cartmen and looted
the property. Immediately afterwards a number of searches were made and the goods
were found with various persons."
[Emphasis supplied]
34. In the cases in which presumption is drawn against the accused on the basis of the recovery of
stolen property, the arrest was made immediately after the incident, therefore, the facts of the
present case is similar to that of Man Singh (supra).
Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011
35. As per the observations made by the Apex Court in the case of Sheo Nath (supra), in absence of
any evidence that the accused knew about the dacoity and also about the stolen property relates to
the same, conviction only under Section 411 of the I.P.C. is permissible. In this case, the murder was
also committed while committing a robbery and stolen clothes were seized, after three days of the
occurrence, but there were no other evidence by any eye witness indicating involvement and
knowledge of dacoity to the persons from whom stolen articles were seized. In the present case also,
the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence showing that the accused persons were involved and
were also aware of the fact that the seized articles related to the dacoity.
36. In view of the above, the finding of the trial Court relating to three persons entering into the
bank is correct and undoubtedly, there were evidence against them as they have been identified by
the witnesses produced by the prosecution, but so far as the other accused are concerned, the
presumption invoked under Section 114 of the Evidence Act against them on the ground that the
recovery of stolen articles and other articles relating to the dacotiy have been seized from them and
further they failed to Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011
give sufficient explanation in the statement under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. is incorrect, as per the
settled position of law presumption cannot be invoked against the accused only on the basis of the
recovery made declaring them dacoits. In absence of any other incriminating circumstances, such
presumption should not be invoked. Here in this case, presumption has been invoked against the
accused/appellants regarding their conjoint attempt in committing crime on the basis of the
statement of Anand Rai (PW/10) and recovery made from them. Analyzing the reasoning assigned
by the trial Court, we find that in view of legal position discussed by the Apex Court and other
Courts mentioned in preceding paragraphs, the impugned judgment calls for interference. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 15
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
witness Anand Rai (PW/10) has identified only one accused i.e. Sultan meaning thereby no other
accused ever stayed in the lodge alongwith Sultan. The prosecution has not produced any other
evidence in this regard. Further, in the statement of accused under Section 313, they have denied
seizure made from them and all seizure witnesses have been turned hostile. The trial Court although
observed that merely because seizure witnesses have not supported the prosecution case, the
statement of the Investigating Officer cannot be ignored. However, Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007,
839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 in the facts and circumstances of the present case,
when the conviction is based upon recovery, not supporting the case of the prosecution by seizure
witnesses carries some value. Especially when no specific circumstance regarding knowledge of
dacoity put to the accused in Section 313 statement. The law laid down by the Apex Court in case of
Sharad Birdhi Chandra (supra) is applicable, which is as follows:-
"142. Apart from the aforesaid comments there is one vital defect in some of the
circumstances mentioned above and relied upon by the High Court, viz.,
circumstances Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17. As these circumstances were not
put to the appellant in his statement under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure
Code they must be completely excluded from consideration because the appellant did
not have any chance to explain them. This has been consistently held by this Court as
far back as 1953 where in the case of Hate Singh Bhagat Singh v. State of Madhya
Bharat AIR 1953 SC 468 this Court held that any circumstance in respect of which an
accused was not examined under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code cannot
be used against him."
In the present case, there is nothing on record to show that the accused from whom recovery of
stolen articles is made and presumption has been drawn against them were made aware of that the
seized articles related to the dacoity and no specific question has been put to them regarding the fact
that despite knowing the seized articles to be of the dacoity, the same have been enjoyed by them.
Thus, in absence of any specific circumstances put to the accused regarding their knowledge Cr. A.
Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 about seized articles
relating to the bank dacoity, such presumption cannot be drawn against them treating them dacoits.
Accordingly, even in absence of explanation as has been given in the present case, same cannot be
used against the accused for making them accused of dacoity. At the most, they can be punished for
an offence either under Section 411 or 412 of the I.P.C. The Apex Court in (2014) 9 SCC 299 [Raju @
Devendra Choubey Vs. State of Chhattisgarh] while dealing with case of conspiracy and Section
120-B of the I.P.C. has observed as follows:-
"It is settled law that common intention and conspiracy are matters of inference and
if while drawing an inference any benefit of doubt creeps in, it must go to the
accused."
37. Insofar as the appellant Kailash Singh is concerned, although as per the prosecution, he has
confessed that he was involved in the incident of dacoity but as contended by the learned counsel for
the appellants that such confession is not admissible as per Section 27 of the Evidence Act. We have
considered this aspect and it is relevant to refer the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in (2015) 11
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 16
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
SCC 31 [Indra Dalal Vs. State of Haryana] wherein it has been observed as under:-
16. The philosophy behind the aforesaid provision is acceptance of a harsh reality that
confessions are extorted Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007,
1140/2007 & 783/2011 by the police officers by practicing oppression and torture or
even inducement and, therefore, they are unworthy of any credence. The provision
absolutely excludes from evidence against the accused a confession made by him to a
police officer. This provision applies even to those confessions which are made to a
police officer who may not otherwise be acting as such. If he is a police officer and
confession was made in his presence, in whatever capacity, the same becomes
inadmissible in evidence. This is the substantive rule of law enshrined under this
provision and this strict rule has been reiterated countlessly by this Court as well as
the High Courts.
17. The word 'confession' has no where been defined.
However, the courts have resorted to the dictionary meaning and explained that incriminating
statements by the accused to the police suggesting the inference of the commission of the crime
would amount to confession and, therefore, inadmissible under this provision. It is also defined to
mean a direct acknowledgment of guilt and not the admission of any incriminating fact, however
grave or conclusive. Section 26 of the Evidence Act makes all those confessions inadmissible when
they are made by any person, whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless such a confession
is made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate. Therefore, when a person is in police custody,
the confession made by him even to a third person, that is other than a police officer, shall also
become inadmissible.
18. In the present case, as pointed out above, not only the confessions were made to a police officer,
such confessional statements were made by the appellants after their arrest while they were in police
custody. In Bullu Das v. State of Bihar[1], while dealing with the confessional statements made by
accused before a police officer, this Court held as under:
"7. The confessional statement, Ex.5, stated to have been made by the appellant was
before the police officer in charge of the Godda Town Police Station where the offence
was registered in respect of the murder of Kusum Devi. The FIR was registered at the
police station on 8-8-1995 at about 12.30 p.m. On 9-8-1995, it was after the appellant
was arrested and brought before Rakesh Kumar that he recorded the confessional
statement of the appellant. Surprisingly, no objection was taken by the defence for
admitting it in evidence. The trial court also did not consider whether such a
confessional Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 &
783/2011 statement is admissible in evidence or not. The High Court has also not
considered this aspect. The confessional statement was clearly inadmissible as it was
made by an accused before a police officer after the investigation had started."

19. Notwithstanding the same, the trial court as well as the High Court had relied upon these
confessions on the basis of these statements, coupled with 'other connected evidence available on
the record', particularly the recovery of the scooter from the old house of accused Indra Dalal and
the disclosure/confessional statement (Mark A) made by Jaibir in another case bearing FIR No. 718
dated November 30, 2001 registered under Sections 420/407/463/471/120-B IPC and Sections
25/54/59 of the Arms Act, 1959 registered at Police Station: Civil Lines, Hisar, which has been
proved by Inspector Ram Avatar (PW-15).
[Emphasis Supplied] furthermore, in Pulukuri Kottaya (supra) in paragraph-10 has observed as
under:-
[10] Section 27, which is not artistically worded, provides an exception to the
prohibition imposed by the preceding section, and enables certain statements made
by a person in police custody to be proved. The conditions necessary to bring the
section into operation is that discovery of a fact in consequence of information
received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a Police officer must
be deposed to, and thereupon so much of the information as relates distinctly to the
fact thereby discovered in consequence of information given, some guarantee is
afforded thereby that the information was true, and accordingly can be safely allowed
to be given in evidence; but clearly the extent of the information admissible must
depend on the exact nature of the fact discovered to which such information is
required to relate. Normally the section is brought into operation when a person in
police custody produces from some place of concealment some object, such as a dead
body, a weapon, or ornaments, said to be connected with the crime of which the
informant is accused. Mr. Megaw, for the Crown, has argues that in such a case the
"fact discovered is the physical object produced, and that any information which
relates distinctly to that object can be proved. Upon this view information given by a
person that the body Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007,
1140/2007 & 783/2011 produced is that of a person murdered by him, that the
weapon produced is the one used by him in the commission of a murder, or that the
ornaments produced were stolen in a dacoity would all be admissible. If this be the
effect of section 27, little substance would remain in the ban imposed by the two
preceding sections on confessions made to the police, or by persons in police custody.
That ban was presumably inspired by the fear of the Legislature that a person under
police influence must be induced to confess by the exercise of undue pressure. But if
all that is required to lift the ban be the inclusion in the confession of information
relating to an object subsequently produced, it seems reasonable to suppose that the
persuasive powers of the police will prove equal to the occasino, and that in practice
the ban will lost its effect. On normalprinciples of construction their Lordships think
that the proviso to S.26, added by S.27, should not be held to nullify the substance of
the section. In their Lordships' view it is fallacious to treat the "fact discovered"
within the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered embraces
the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to
this, and the information given must relate distinctly to this fact. Information as to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 18
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
past user, or the past history, of the object produced is nor related to its discovery in
the setting in which it is discovered. Information supplied by a person in custody that
"I will produce a knifeconcealed in the roof of my house" does not lead to the
discovery of knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the discovery of
the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his knowledge, and
if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission of offence, the fact
discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement the wordsbe added "with which I
stabbed A" these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to the discovery of
the knife in the house of the informant."
38. In view of the above, the accused Kailash Singh cannot be said to be involved in
committing dacoity alongwith Sultan, Naushad and Imtiyaz and as such, he should
also be convicted for the offence committed under Section 411 of the I.P.C. and also
under Section 25 (1B)(a) of the Arms Act.
Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011
39. The Division Bench of Delhi High Court in one of the cases i.e. Crl. A. No.231/2017 [Deepak
Yadav Vs. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)], Crl. A. No.317/2017 & Crl. M. (Bail) No.545/2017 [Ravi @
Munna Vs. State] and Crl. A. No.493/2017 & Crl. M.(Bail) No.871/2017 [Babu Musahid @ Ali @
Akram Vs. State NCT of Delhi] while dealing with the offence of Sections 302/34, 392/34 and
Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959 has dealt with the similar circumstance as involved in the present
case in which the conviction is also based upon the presumption of recovery that too of mobile
phone from one of the accused and there was no sufficient explanation given in the statement under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. The Division Bench has dealt with the issue of recovery in the following
manner:-
Recovery
53. The other piece of evidence sought to be relied upon by the prosecution is the
recovery of mobile phone of the deceased from Appellant No.1.
54. The circumstances of the present case indicate that robbery and murder were part
of the same transaction. However, mere recovery of stolen property from the accused,
in the absence of any other evidence, would not be a safe ground to draw an inference
that Appellant No.1 committed the murder.
Furthermore, in such a circumstance, conviction would be also be dependent upon the nature of the
property recovered, and whether it was likely to pass readily from hand to hand. Suspicion would
not take the place of proof. [Ref: State of Rajasthan v. Talevar, reported as (2011) 11 SCC 666].
55. In the present case, the property recovered from Appellant No.1 is the mobile phone of the
deceased. The mobile phone was was likely to be passed readily from hand to hand. It would also Cr.
A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 be relevant to note that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 19
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
the recovery was made two months after the date of the incident.
56. Therefore, recovery of the mobile phone of the deceased from Appellant No.1 two months after
the incident would not be sufficient to convict Appellant No.1 for the underlying offences and, at
most, he can be convicted for the offence punishable under the provision of section 411 IPC, for
being in possession of stolen property. [Ref: Nagappa Dondiba Kalal v. State of Karnataka reported
as 1980 (Supp) SCC 336].
57. Even though a contention was sought to be raised on behalf of Appellant No.1 that the recovery
of mobile phone from Appellant No.1 is tainted since, inter alia, there is no mention either in the
PCR form [Ex.PW- 13/A] or the crime team report [Ex.PW-2/A] about the mobile phone being
taken away by the assailants; the said contention is liable to be rejected, inasmuch as, relevant
witnesses were not examined even in this behalf. No explanation.
58. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rajkumar v. State of Madhya Pradesh reported as (2014) 5 SCC
353, observed in relation to duty of the accused to furnish an explanation under Section 313 CrPC
regarding any incriminating material produced against him, as follows:
" 21. Admittedly, the appellant did not take any defence while making his statement
under Section 313 CrPC, rather boldly alleged that the family of the deceased had
roped him falsely at the instance of the police. However, the appellant could not
reveal as to for what reasons the police was by any means inimical to him.
22. The accused has a duty to furnish an explanation in his statement under Section
313 CrPC regarding any incriminating material that has been produced against him.
If the accused has been given the freedom to remain silent during the investigation as
well as before the court, then the accused may choose to maintain silence or even
remain in complete denial when his statement under Section 313 CrPC is being
recorded. However, in such an event, the court would be entitled to draw an
inference, including such adverse inference against the accused as may be
permissible in accordance with law. (Vide Ramnaresh v. State of Chhattisgarh
[(2012) 4 SCC 257 : (2012) 2 SCC (Cri) 382] , Munish Mubar v. State of Haryana
[(2012) 10 SCC 464 : (2013) 1 SCC (Cri) 52 : AIR 2013 SC 912] and Raj Kumar
Singhv. State of Rajasthan [(2013) 5 SCC 722 : (2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 812].) Cr. A. Nos.
725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011
23. In the instant case, as the appellant did not take any defence or furnish any
explanation as to any of the incriminating material placed by the trial court, the
courts below have rightly drawn an adverse inference against him. The appellant has
not denied his presence in the house on that night. When the children were left in the
custody of the appellant, he was bound to explain as under what circumstances
Gounjhi died."

Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
59. No doubt that failure of accused to furnish an explanation with respect to any incriminating
material put to him would entitle the court to draw an adverse inference against him, however, we
should not be oblivious of the fact that the initial burden is on the prosecution to prove all the
charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The guilt of the accused must be conclusively
proved by direct or circumstantial substantive piece of evidence.
60. Further, the prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot derive any strength
from the weakness of the defence. Although, where all the links in the chain of events are complete,
a false plea or a defence may be called into aid but only to lend assurance to the court. In other
words, before using the additional link it must be proved that all the links in the chain are complete
and do not suffer from any infirmity. It is not the law that any infirmity or lacuna in the prosecution
case could be cured or supplied by a false defence or a plea which is not accepted by the court.
[Ref:Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra reported as (1984) 4 SCC 116].
61. The evidence available on record has either been discredited or held to be not sufficient to render
a conviction thereupon. The prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused. Now the
prosecution cannot seek to fall back on the statement of the Appellants recorded without oath
under.
62. Therefore, in light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, failure on the part of the
Appellants to furnish an explanation with respect to the incriminating material put to them, would
not come to the aid of the prosecution. Conclusion
63. A Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay in Geeta Keshav Shankar v. The State of
Maharashtra reported as 2009 (111) BomLR 1163 observed as follows:
"62. The standard of proof in criminal case has to be beyond reasonable doubt. This
expression is of higher standard, of course, there cannot be absolute standard stating
degree of proof. This could depend Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 upon the facts of a given case. Doubts would be
called reasonable if they are free from zest for abstract speculation. To constitute
reasonable doubt, it must be free from an over emotional response. Doubts must be
actual and substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused person arising from the
evidence."
(Emphasis supplied)
64. In the given factual background, the possibility of persons other than the Appellants having
committed the underlying offence cannot be ruled out with a fair degree of certainty. Convicting the
appellants on the scanty evidence available on record would amount to conviction on mere
suspicion and supposition. In our considered view, the offence has not been proved against the
Appellants beyond reasonable doubt and lacks the certainty required and mandated by law.

40. The Division Bench relying upon the several decisions of the Apex Court has observed that the
prosecution must stand or fall on its legs and it cannot derive any strength from the weakness of the
defence and has also observed that merely because sufficient explanation is not given, but any
lacuna would not come to aid the prosecution.
41. As has already been discussed hereinabove that the accused were arrested after almost four
months from the incident and then seizure, no other person was identified except three accused,
presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Act has been invoked against the other accused
treating them part of the incident of dacoity, as recovery of stolen articles Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007,
824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 made therefrom and no other
incriminating material available on record treating appellant Kailash Singh @ Guddu involved in the
dacoity. The ingredients of Section 391 of the I.P.C. are not proved to be fulfilled. It is also clarified,
as to why inference cannot be drawn against the accused merely because they failed to give sufficient
explanation.
42. Accordingly, we are of the view that in the light of various decisions of Hon'ble Apex Court and
also the High Courts as discussed above, we have no hesitation to say that the trial Court has
committed material illegality in convicting the appellants under Section 395/120-B of the I.P.C. as
the reasoning given by the Court below on the basis of foundation regarding dacoity whereas in view
of the discussion made above, no case of dacoity is made out, it is a case of robbery and accordingly,
sentence given by the Court below is modified in the following manner:-
(1) Appellants Musammi @ Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit and Imtiyaaz Khan @ Raj @
Raja @ Rahul are being convicted under Section 393/120-B of I.P.C. and sentenced
to undergo 7 years R.I. with fine as awarded by the trial Court.
(2) Appellants Sheikh Israil @ Gudda, Mohd. Sadab, Afzal Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007,
824/2007, 839/2007, 924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 Ahmad Khan and Kailash
Singh @ Guddu are convicted under Section 411 of I.P.C and sentenced to suffer 3
years R.I. with fine as awarded by the Trial Court.
(3) So far as the conviction and sentence under Section 25(1B)(a) of the Arms Act
awarded to the appellants Sheikh Israil @ Gudda and Afzal Ahmad Khan by the trial
Court is concerned, the same is hereby maintained/affirmed.
(4) As regards the conviction under Section 412 of I.P.C., the same was made against
appellant Rani Singh and accused Mirza Irshad Beg by the trial Court and looking to
the reasons discussed in preceding paragraphs, the conviction of Rani Singh and
Mirza Irshad Beg is altered to Section 411 of I.P.C. and thus, they are convicted under
Section 411 of I.P.C. and sentenced to suffer 3 years R.I. with fine as awarded by the
trial Court.
43. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the appellants are party allowed to the extent indicated
hereinabove. Appellants Kailash, Musammi @ Naushad @ Rinku @ Rohit and Imtiyaaz Khan @ Raj
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/134306556/ 22
Imtiyaz Khan @ Raj@ Raja @Rahul vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 25 April, 2019
@ Raja @ Rahul are already in jail whereas appellants Rani Singh, Mirza Irshad Beg, Sheikh Israil
alias Gudda, Mohd. Sadab and Afzal Ahmand Khan are on bail. Their bail-bonds stand cancelled
and they are directed to be taken into custody Cr. A. Nos. 725/2007, 824/2007, 839/2007,
924/2007, 1140/2007 & 783/2011 forthwith and to surrender before the trial Court for serving their
respective remaining part of jail sentence.
