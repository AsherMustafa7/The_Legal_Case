Mr.C.Kathiravan, learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents 1 to 4 and
Mr.S.Madhusudhanan, learned Standing Counsel appearing for the fifth respondent.
3. The case of the petitioners is that they purchased their respective properties comprised in various
survey numbers in Mathur Village, after acquisition proceedings. The Government of Tamil Nadu,
in order to establish an aromatic complex, under G.O.Ms.No.648, Industries dated 16.09.1989,
accorded sanction for the acquisition and transfer of 1655.92 acres in patta land and poramboke
lands in Mathur and five other villages for the location of the Aromatics Complex of National
Aromatics and Petrochemical Corporation and other downstream projects by invoking urgency
clause under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The lands to be acquired included the
lands to the souther side of the 200 feet road also called the MMRD road in Mathur Village, that
were used for agricultural purposes as well as residential purposes.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56978875/ 2
Shiv Rattan Khanna vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
4. The Official Committee appointed under the aforesaid Government order identified and found
suitable lands of an extent of 63.60.5 hectares of patta lands and 50.89.8 hectares of poramboke
lands in No.31, Mathur Village.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014 Pursuant to the proposal for the
acquisition of lands under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act under the urgency clause was
notified under G.O.Ms.No.1440, Industries (MID-1) Department dated 04.12.1990.
Thereafter, the declaration under Section 6 was published in G.O.Ms.No.319, Industries (MID-1)
Department, dated 27.07.1992. In pursuant to the same, an award was passed on 26.08.1994 in
Award No.11 of 1994.
5. While being so, the general public in Mathur Village had sent representations to drop the
acquisition proceedings. Thereafter, the Government, passed G.O.Ms.No.2 (D) No.56/MDRJ dated
01.03.1994, ordered for exclusion of 132.13 acres form acquisition and 65.72 acres for acquisition
falling on the south of MMRD road in Mathur Village. The Special Commissioner (Land
Acquisition), by a letter dated 07.03.1997, requested the Government to consider the request on
getting the technical opinion from all concerned. In the light of the said recommendations, the
proposal for the exclusion of certain lands to an extent of 131.92 acres falling on the southern side of
the MMRD road and by the Government letter dated 11.03.2004 made partial amendments to the
aforesaid Government order dated 01.03.1994 and directed to transfer 13.17.5 hectares to CPCL
exclusively for accommodating the families which were displaced due to acquisition of land for
Aromatic https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014 Complex and transfer
the remaining extent of 65.72 acres of lands to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and to the
Highways Department on collection of the cost of lands and cost of acquisition.
6. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board need space only to put up towers and to take over the lands
paying land value and other charges. They also decided to put up a 400 KV power station in the said
area. The land value has been paid through Cheque dated 28.11.2013. The second respondent issued
notice to the encrochers under the Land Encroachment Act. There were illegal sales of the acquired
land. The reason for this is that post award action could not be completed due to grant of stay by this
Court. After disposal of the writ petition, symbolic possession of the lands were taken and also
handed over to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited.
7. The Highways Department entered into the lands and completed the MMRD Road (I.R.R) on the
realigned area close to Manjambakkam border in survey No.167 and 168 pt etc. The lands in survey
No.83pt, 88pt, 89, 90pt, 94 are in the rehabilitation layout and the plots were alloted already and
occupied by the allottees by constructing house. Therefore, all the petitioners had purchased the
land already acquired and symbolic possession is already taken https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014 after depositing the compensation amount under Revenue
Deposit in Government Treasury as the land owner has not chosen to receive the compensation.
8. The lands were acquired on 26.08.1994 and the petitioners had purchased the land in the year
2013. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board had paid the land value on 28.11.2013 and proposed to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56978875/ 3
Shiv Rattan Khanna vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
utilize the land to put up 400 KV sub-station. All the petitioners have filed the present writ petitions
after eviction proceedings initiated by the fourth respondent herein. All the petitioners are being the
subsequent purchasers, they have no locus to challenge the acquisition proceedings. Even proviso to
Section 24(2) of the Act, does not recognise such purchasers and does not give any right to
subsequent purchasers to invoke provisions of Section 24(2) of the Act.
9. In this regard, it is relevant to rely upon the judgment reported in (2019) 10 SCC 229 in the case
of Shiv Kumar and anr Vs Union of India and ors, in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India held
as follows :-
“13. The definition of 'landowner' is in Section 3(r), the same is extracted hereunder:
3. Definition.-In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,-- .....
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014
(r) "landowner" includes any person,-- (i) whose name is recorded as the owner of the land or
building or part thereof, in the records of the authority concerned; or
(ii) any person who is granted forest rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest
Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (2 of 2007) or under any other law for the time
being in force; or
(iii) who is entitled to be granted Patta rights on the land under any law of the State including
assigned lands; or (iv) any person who has been declared as such by an order of the court or
Authority;
Landowner is a person who is recorded as the owner of land or building. The record of date of
issuance of preliminary notification Under Section 11 is relevant. A purchaser after Section 11 cannot
be said to be a landowner within the purview of Section 3(r).
............................
21. Thus, under the provisions of Section 24 of the Act of 2013, challenge to acquisition proceeding
of the taking over of possession under the Act of 1894 cannot be made, based on a void transaction
nor declaration can be sought Under https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of
2014 Section 24(2) by such incumbents to obtain the land. The declaration that acquisition has
lapsed under the Act of 2013 is to get the property back whereas, the transaction once void, is always
a void transaction, as no title can be acquired in the land as such no such declaration can be sought.
It would not be legal, just and equitable to give the land back to purchaser as land was not capable of
being sold which was in process of acquisition under the Act of 1894. The Act of 2013 does not
confer any right on purchaser whose sale is ab initio void. Such void transactions are not validated
under the Act of 2013. No rights are conferred by the provisions contained in the 2013 Act on such a
purchaser as against the State.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56978875/ 4
Shiv Rattan Khanna vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
22. 'Void is, ab initio,' a nullity, is inoperative, and a person cannot claim the land or declaration
once no title has been conferred upon him to claim that the land should be given back to him. A
person cannot enforce and ripe fruits based on a void transaction to start claiming title and
possession of the land by seeking a declaration Under Section 24 of the Act of 2013; it will amount to
conferment of benefit never contemplated by the law. The question is, who can claim
declaration/rights Under Section 24(2) for the restoration of land or lapse of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014 acquisition. It cannot be by a
person with no title in the land. The provision of the Act of 2013 cannot be said to be enabling or
authorizing a purchaser after Section 4 to question proceeding taken under the Act of 1894 of taking
possession as held in U.P. Jal Nigam (supra) which is followed in M. Venkatesh (supra) and other
decisions and consequently claim declaration Under Section 24 of the Act of 2013. What cannot be
done directly cannot be permitted in an indirect method.
23. The provisions of the Act of 2013 aimed at the acquisition of land with least disturbance to the
landowners and other affected families and to provide just and fair compensation to affected
families whose land has been acquired or proposed to be acquired or are affected and to make
adequate provisions for such affected persons for their rehabilitation and resettlement. The
provisions of Act of 2013 aim at ousting all inter-meddlers from the fray by ensuring payment in the
bank account of landholders Under Section 77 of the Act.
24. The intendment of Act of 2013 is to benefit farmers etc. Subsequent purchasers cannot be said to
be landowners entitled to restoration of land and cannot be termed to be affected persons within the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014 provisions of Act of 2013. It is
not open to them to claim that the proceedings have lapsed Under Section 24(2).”
10. That apart, the only ground raised by the petitioners that they have not received any
compensation and their possession has not been taken over even today. Admittedly, all the
petitioners are subsequent purchasers and symbolic possession of the properties have been taken
over and the compensation amount has been deposited under the revenue deposit.
11. That apart, the grounds raised by the petitioners in these Writ Petitions have already been settled
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the judgment reported in (2020) 8 SCC 129 in the case of
Indore Development Authority Vs. Manoharlal and ors etc., which held as follows :-
“366. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we answer the questions as under:
1. Under the provisions of Section 24(1)(a) in case the award is not made as on
1.1.2014 the date of commencement of Act of 2013, there is no lapse of proceedings.
Compensation has to be determined under the provisions of Act of 2013.
2. In case the award has been passed within the window period of five years excluding
the period covered https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of
2014 by an interim order of the court, then proceedings shall continue as provided
under Section 24(1)(b) of the Act of 2013 under the Act of 1894 as if it has not been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56978875/ 5
Shiv Rattan Khanna vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
repealed.
3. The word or used in Section 24(2) between possession and compensation has to be
read as nor or as and. The deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 takes place where due to inaction of authorities for
five years or more prior to commencement of the said Act, the possession of land has
not been taken nor compensation has been paid. In other words, in case possession
has been taken, compensation has not been paid then there is no lapse.
Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has not been taken then there is no lapse.
4. The expression 'paid' in the main part of Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not include a
deposit of compensation in court. The consequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to Section
24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings then all
beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the
Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.
In case the obligation under Section 31 of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled,
interest under Section 34 of the said Act can be granted. Non-deposit of compensation (in court)
does not result in the lapse of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014
land acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five
years or more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the "landowners" as on the date
of notification for land acquisition under Section 4 of the Act of 1894.
5. In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under Section 31(1) of the Act
of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under Section 24(2) due to
non-payment or non- deposit of compensation in court. The obligation to pay is complete by
tendering the amount under Section 31(1). Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or
who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had
lapsed under Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013.
6. The proviso to Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 is to be treated as part of Section 24(2) not part of
Section 24(1)(b).
7. The mode of taking possession under the Act of 1894 and as contemplated under Section 24(2) is
by drawing of inquest report/ memorandum. Once award has been passed on taking possession
under Section 16 of the Act of 1894, the land vests in State there is no divesting provided under
Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013, as once possession has been taken there is no lapse under Section
24(2).
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014
8. The provisions of Section 24(2) providing for a deemed lapse of proceedings are applicable in case
authorities have failed due to their inaction to take possession and pay compensation for five years
or more before the Act of 2013 came into force, in a proceeding for land acquisition pending with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56978875/ 6
Shiv Rattan Khanna vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 13 December, 2021
concerned authority as on 1.1.2014. The period of subsistence of interim orders passed by court has
to be excluded in the computation of five years.
9. Section 24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of
concluded proceedings of land acquisition. Section 24 applies to a proceeding pending on the date of
enforcement of the Act of 2013, i.e., 1.1.2014. It does not revive stale and time-barred claims and
does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of
taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead
of court to invalidate acquisition.”
12. In view of the settled position of law, this Court is of the considered view that the writ petition is
liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits.
However, the petitioners are at liberty to approach the authority concerned for re-conveyance of the
land in the manner know to law.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.Nos. 28329 to 28336 of 2014
13. In the result, the Writ Petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected miscellaneous
petitions are closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
