Chunni Lal vs State Of U.P. And 4 Others on 1 May, 2025
Contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that the aforesaid order dated 21.10.2024 is
nothing, but repetition of the earlier order dated 9.6.2021.
It has been very emphatically argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the above
mentioned order order dated 21.10.2024 has been passed by the respondent No.4 without taking
into consideration the legal and bona fide objections raised by the petitioner and as such, the same
is not sustainable in law.
Learned Standing Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent raised a preliminary objection
regarding the entertainability of present writ petitioner. He submits that under Section 67(5) of the
U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 the petitioner is having an efficacious statutory remedy of appeal, to
challenge the order dated 21.10.2024 passed under Section 67 of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2016.
Since the availability of an efficacious statutory remedy of appeal under Section 67(5) of the U.P.
Revenue Code, 2006 could not be disputed by the learned counsel for the petitioner, this Court is of
the view that no useful purpose would be served to keep the present writ petition pending, in view of
the availability of statutory remedy of appeal as provided under Section 67(5) of the U.P. Revenue
Code, 2006.
Accordingly, the present writ petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to file appeal under
Section 67(5) of the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 against the order dated 21.10.2024 before the
Collector concerned. It is provided that in case the petitioner files an appeal under Section 67(5) of
the U.P. Revenue Code, 2006 against the aforesaid order dated 21.10.2024 within a period of thirty
days from today, the same shall be entertained by the Collector concerned on its' merit and the same
shall be decided within a period of six months as provided under Rule 183(4) of the U.P. Revenue
Code Rules, 2016.
