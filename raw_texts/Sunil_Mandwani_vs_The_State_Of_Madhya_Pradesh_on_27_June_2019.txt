(2). Brief facts of the case are that complainant Deepak Kumar Mandwani has given a written

Tech Private Limited.The said company is owned 44 square feet diverted land situated at survey No.
193, 203, 204 of Village Tejpur Gadwadi, Tehsil and District Indore. The rate of the aforesaid land

the said provisions of Act, 2013. The Union of India through Ministry of Company Affairs have
issued a notification dated 18.05.2016 thereby the Court of IX Additional Sessions Judge,Gwalior is
constituted as a Special Court for State of M.P., therefore, the aforesaid court is competent to try the
case registered against the applicants. Hence, they may be discharged for the offence registered
against them.
(4). After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the trial court rejected the application filed by the
applicants holding that under the provisions of Companies Act cognizance of matter can only be
taken if complaint is made by Registrar of Companies or shareholders, therefore, the provisions of
Companies Act, 2013 are not applicable in the present case and this court is having jurisdiction to
try the case registered by the police against the applicants for the offence punishable under Indian
Penal Code,.
(5). Learned counsel for the applicants has submitted that according to the Section 436 (2) of the
Act, 2013, a special court can try offence other than offence under the provisions of Companies Act
with which the accused may under the Cr.P.C. be charged. The trial court failed to appreciate that
the complainant Deepak Mandwani was Ex- director and shareholder of the company hence he was
competent to make complaint as per provisions of Section 439 (2) of Companies Act. The trial court
has also not considered the fact that non calling of meeting, preparation of forged resignation are
offences under the provisions of Act, 2013 and are covered by fraud under Section 447 of Act, 2013
and is punishable for an imprisonment which may extend to 10 years, therefore, according to the
Section 439 as well as notification dated 18.05.2016 only the special court have competent to take
cognizance of offence, therefore, the impugned order may be set aside and applicants be discharged
from the charges under Section 420,467,468,471/34 of I.P.C. (6). On the other hand, learned
counsel for the complainant has submitted that applicant No.1 with the sole objective to deceive the
complainant and throw them out from the company, fraudulently superimposed their signatures on
the resignation letters and removed him from the Board of Directors of the company. He also
committed fraud and cheating against the complainant by manipulating and fabricating the records
of the company and filing of false return with the Registrar of Companies. The sole objective of the
applicant No.1 was to gain the control over the assets of the company and to deceive betray and
cheat the complainant, which is clearly offences punishable under sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468,
471 and 201 read with Section 120-B of the I.P.C. After removing the complainant on the basis of
false, forged and fabricated resignation letter, the applicant No.1 also appointed his brother
applicant No.2 Ashok Mandwani as one of the directors in the company to fulfill the requirement of
minimum two directors in the company however, no such decision can be taken by the company
unless the Board of Directors in their meeting has taken such decision and no board meeting can
pass any resolution unless quorum is present. Thus, applicants committed fraud and cheating with
the complainant for the purpose of financial gain, therefore, the FIR was registered by the police
against the applicants for the offence under Section 420,467,468,471/34 read with Section 120-B of
I.P.C. and after detailed investigation as well as obtaining the report of the hand writing expert
charge sheet has been filed by the police. It is further submitted that Section 435 of the Companies
Act 2013 provides for establishment of Special Court to try offences punishable under the
Companies Act with imprisonment of 2 years or more. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the Special
Court is limited to the offences punishable under the Companies Act, 2013 and not under the Indian
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/145439054/ 2

Penal Code or any offences committed under any other law. Thus, the trial court has not committed
any error in rejecting the application filed by the applicant under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. Hence,
learned counsel for the respondent prays for dismissal of the revision petition.
(7). Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
(8). According to the notification dated 18.05.2016 in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub
Section 1 of section 435 of Companies Act 2013 the Central Government after obtaining the
concurrence of the respective of Chief Justices of the High Court designates the courts mentioned in
the table as special court for the purpose of trial of offence punishable under the Companies Act,
2013 with imprisonment of 2 years or more in terms of section 435 of the Companies Act, 2013. As
per Serial No.6 of the table IX Additional Sessions Judge Gwalior has been designated as Special
Judge for the State of Madhya Pradesh to try the offences punishable under the Companies Act,
2013. Provision of Section 436 (2) also provide that while trying an offence under the Companies
Act, a Special Court may also try an offence other than an offence under this Act with which the
accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 be charged at the same trial. This
provisions reads more scope of doubt that for special court who have jurisdiction, its a precondition
that an offence punishable under the Companies Act, 2013 must be alleged or committed . However,
in the present case, no offence under the Companies Act has been registered by the police. The
police has registered the offence against the applicants punishable under Section under Section
420,467,468,471/34 of I.P.C.therefore, after completion of the investigation, police filed
charge-sheet against the applicants before the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class Indore who
committed the case to the Sessions Court, which was transferred to the 12 th Additional Sessions
Judge, Indore for the trial. During the course of argument, learned counsel for the applicant unable
to point out that what act of the applicants alleged in the complaint violated the provisions of
Companies Act and punishable under the said Act. In these circumstances the trial court has rightly
held that applicants have fabricated and manipulated the records of the company to commit fraud
and cheating against the complainant by showing resignation from the Board of Directors by forging
the signatures by way of superimposing their signatures in the resignation letter and this fact is also
substantiated by the report of the hand writing expert. Therefore, the police registered the offence
against the applicants for the offence punishable under Section under Section 420,467,468,471/34
of I.P.C. and no criminal trial has been initiated against the applicants for any of the offence which
are punishable under the provision of Companies Act, therefore, in absence of the any offence
punishable under the Companies Act, Special Court is not having jurisdiction to try the case which is
punishable under the Indian Penal Code and court of Indore has territorial jurisdiction to try the
case for the commission of offence punishable under Section under Section 420,467,468,471/34 of
I.P.C. Therefore, this court is of the view that the trial court has not committed any error in rejecting
the application under Section 227 of Cr.P.C. filed by the applicants.
(9). Accordingly, this petition is dismissed.
