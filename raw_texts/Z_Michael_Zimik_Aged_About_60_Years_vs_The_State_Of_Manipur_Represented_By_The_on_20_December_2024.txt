BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE A. GUNESHWAR SHARMA For the Petitioners : Mr. Debdutta,
Advocate in WP(C) No. 264 of Mr. N. Mahendra, Advocate in WP(C) No. 868 of For the
Respondents : Mr. Th. Sukumar, G.A for State Mr. Kh. Tarunkumar, Sr. Adv. with Ms. K. Mercy,
Advocate for R-5&10 in WP(C) No. 868 of 2022 & R-3&4 in WP(C) No. 264 of 2022; Mr. Sh.
Athoi, Advocate for R-6 in WP(C) No. 868 of Date of Hearing : 18-10-2024 Date of Order :
20-12-2024 JUDGEMENT& ORDER [CAV] [1] The instant writ petitions are filed praying for
setting aside the impugned order dated 21-3-2022 passed by the Department CAF & PD, Govt. of
Manipur for appointment of respondents as Members of the Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commissions (District & State) as violative of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019
and Rules of 2020. Since these two writ petitions concern with the same notification and order, they
are being considered and disposed of by this common order.
[2] Brief facts in WP(C) No. 264 of 2022 are that the present petitioner joined as Asst. Public
Prosecutor cum Asst. Govt. Advocate (District) under the Government of Manipur in the year 2008
on contract basis. Thereafter his service was regularized by the authority in the year 2016. The
petitioner after completing his term of appointment as APP cum AGA (District) got retired from
service on attaining superannuation in the year 2021.
[3] Government of Manipur through department CAF & PD issued a Notification dated 8-11-2021
inviting applications from the intending candidates for appointment of President and Members of
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (State Commission) and District Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission (District Commission) of Manipur respectively. The aforesaid Notification
was issued in terms of the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter
referred to as the Act in short) enforced wef 20-7-2020. The eligibility and qualification for
appointment to the post of President and Members of the State Commission are enumerated in
Section 43 of the Act and Rule No. 3 of the Consumer Protection (Qualification for appointment,
method of recruitment, procedure of appointment, term of office, resignation and removal of the
President and Member of the State Commission and District Commission) Rules, 2020 (hereinafter
referred to as the Rules in short).
[4] The relevant portion of the above mentioned Rules are reproduced below for kind perusal:
"3. Qualifications for appointment of President and members of the State
Commission--- (1) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as President,
unless he is, or has been, a Judge of the High Court:
(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a member unless he is of not
less than forty years of age and possesses--

Z. Michael Zimik Aged About 60 Years vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 20 December, 2024
(a) an experience of at least ten years as presiding officer of a district court or of any
tribunal at equivalent level or combined service as such in the district court and
tribunal;
(b) a bachelor's degree from a recognized university and is a person of ability,
integrity and standing, and has special knowledge and professional experience of not
less than twenty years in consumer affairs, law, public affairs, administration,
economics, Commerce, industry, finance, management, engineering, technology,
public health or medicine:
(3) At least one member or the President of the State Commission shall be a Woman.
[5] It is stated that from the reading of the above provisions of Rules and wordings incorporated, the
number of post earmarked for candidate in respect of the President or Member in the State
Commission is 1(one). This condition is made absolutely clear in both Rules as well as in the
notice/advertisement dated 8-11-202 1 for appointment of President and Members in the State
Commission. In the said Notification so far as the female member is concerned, only one post of
member has been prescribed in the Notification, however, while issuing the appointment orders
altogether 2 (two) female candidates have been appointed as Members of the State Commission
which is not in conformity with the Scheme of the appointment of deserving candidates for the posts
of Members in the State Commission.
[6] The petitioner having fulfilled the requisite qualifications for the candidature of the same and
also having high expectation of being appointed to the post of Member, has applied by submitting
his qualification and eligibility certificates formally to the authority. The personal interview and viva
voce test was conducted on 30-12-2021 by a selection committee before which the humble petitioner
also appeared. The result of the aforesaid interview conducted by the duly constituted Selection
Committee was notified on 21-3-2022 and appointments were accorded to incumbents (respondent
Nos. 3,4, 5, 6, 7 and
8) in the manner as under:
(A) Members of State Commission:-
1. Smt. M. Premila
2. Smt. A. Nibedita Devi
3. Shri N. Banikumar Singh (B) Presidents of District Commissions:-
1. Shri K. Rabei Singh
2. Smt. R.K. Sunitra Devi

Z. Michael Zimik Aged About 60 Years vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 20 December, 2024
3. Shri Y. Lokendro Singh [7] To the utter shock and surprise of the humble
petitioner, two females were appointed as Members of the State Commission against
the mandate of the Act and also not in conformity with the condition prescribed in
the advertisement, wherein it has been clearly and categorically mentioned for 1
(one) post of Member (Female).
[8] It is submitted that the established principle of law that in the public employment a standard
yardstick of selection procedure is always expected to be followed in a fair manner which is free
from any arbitrariness and favouritism. In the instant case, the procedure adopted by the Selection
Committee appears to be quite irregular and hence subjected to the deprivation of the legitimate
right of the humble petitioner to be considered in terms of the quota (vacancy) earmarked for the
male candidate. The 1 (one) number of post of Member of State Commission meant for male
candidate have been usurped by appointing two numbers of female candidates by exceeding the
advertised number of post in the Notice. The petitioner came to know about the said appointment
order dated 21-3-2022 and soon thereafter he submitted a representation dated 28- 3-2022 to the
Hon'ble Chief Minister of Manipur with copies being circulated to the competent authorities for
redressing the irregularity and also to ventilate his grievance. However, the same is still pending.
[9] The recommendation of the Selection Committee is tainted with non action of mind and suffers
from unreasonableness so far as the selection of female candidate and male candidates are
concerned. Being aggrieved by the inaction, illegality, arbitrariness and unjustifiable actions on the
part of the respondents, the present petition is being filed bonafide before the Hon'ble High Court
for setting aside the impugned order dated 21-3-2022 in respect of appointment of the Members of
the State Commission as illegal and void ab- initio and to direct the respondents to hold the fresh
selection process.
[10] The State respondents filed counter affidavit stating that the mistake in the Notification dated
08-11-2021 was later on rectified in terms of Rule 3(3) of the Rules of 2020 by issuing a
Corrigendum dated 11-11-2021, whereby the number of vacancies of the Members of the State
Commission be read as "Members- 3 (three) vacancies and at least one Member or the President
shall be a woman" in place of "Member (Male)- 2(two) and Member Female- 1 (one)"
as occurred at Sl. No. 2 & 3 of Notification dated 08-11-2021. It is pointed out that the
only ground taken in the writ petition is appointing excess number of female
Members as advertised in the Notification dated 08-11-2021. It is stated that after the
issuance of the Corrigendum dated 11-11-2021, the cause of the writ petition does not
exist from the very inception and the petitioner has concealed this vital document
from this Court. It is submitted that appointment of more than one female Member is
not barred by Rule. The petitioner has also failed to challenge the Corrigendum dated
11-11-2021. It is urged that the writ petition be dismissed being devoid of merit and
for concealment of vital document.
[11] Respondent Nos. 3, 4 & 5 have also adopted the stand of the State respondents to
the point that the initial defect has already been rectified and the Rules permit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76061136/ 5
Z. Michael Zimik Aged About 60 Years vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 20 December, 2024
appointment of more than one female Member in the State Commission.
[12] The petitioner did not file any rejoinder affidavit specifically to counter the
issuance of Corrigendum dated 11-11-2021.
[13] Mr. Th. Sukumar, learned GA as well Mr. Kh. Tarunkumar, learned senior
counsel for the respondent Nos. 3&4 urge that with the issuance the Corrigendum
dated 11-11-2021, the cause in the writ petition does not exist from the very
beginning. The petitioner has also concealed this vital fact from this Court with
malafide intention of harassing the respondents. It is also highlighted that the
petitioner despite having a clear knowledge of the corrigendum, he appeared before
the Selection Board without any protest and only as and when he was not selected, he
filed the aforesaid writ petition by challenging the legality of the appointment order
dated 21-03-2022. Such action of the petitioner is barred by the principle of estoppel
as well as doctrine of approbate and reprobate. Reliance is placed on the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Anupal Singh and Ors. Versus the
State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. reported in (2020) 2 SCC 173 where it has been held
that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around
and challenge the selection process (relevant para 55). Similar view was taken by the
Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Madan Lal Versus State of J&K reported in (1995) 3
SCC 486 (relevant para 9).
[14] It is submitted that as the petitioner has failed at the interview after participating
without any protest, he cannot turn around and challenge the appointment order of
the private respondents dated 21-03-2022, Moreover, the appointment of the private
respondents as Member (Female) is also permissible in view of the aforesaid Rule 3
sub rule 3 of the Consumer Protection (Qualification for Appointment, Method of
Recruitment, Procedure of Appointment, Term of Office, Resignation and Removal of
the President and Members of the State Commission and District Commission)
Rules, 2020. The writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable as the same
is barred by the principles of estoppel and devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed.
[15] Brief facts in WP(C) No. 686 of 2022 are that Respondent No.1 issued a Govt.
Notice dated 08-11-2021 inviting applications from the intending candidates for
appointment of President and Members of Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (State Commission) and District Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (District Commission) of Manipur. The petitioner, respondents no. 4 to
9, among other candidates, applied for the notified vacant posts. Petitioner applied
for the post of President of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(District Commission) in response to the said Govt. Notice dated 08-11-2021 by
submitting application dated 17-11-2021 with necessary enclosures. The respondent
nos. 7 to 9 applied for the post of Members of Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission (State Commission) and as well as for the posts of President of District
Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District Commission) of Manipur.

the respondent no.5 to return the wrongful monetary benefits, by way of salary, etc., obtained by her
during the tenure of illegal appointment.
GROUNDS
i) Because there is violation of the petitioner's right to be considered fairly and properly for the
appointment to the post of President of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District
Commission) of Manipur;
ii) Because a bachelor's degree from a recognized university and then to be a person of ability,
integrity and standing, and has special knowledge and professional experience of not less than
twenty years in consumer affairs, law, public affairs, administration, economics, Commerce,
industry, finance, management, engineering, technology, public health or medicine is mandatory in
terms of Rule 3(2)(b) of the Consumer Protection (Qualification for appointrnent, Method of
Recruitment, Procedure of Appointment, Terms of Office, Resignation and Removal of the President
and Members of the State Commission and District Commission) Rules, 2020;
iii) Because respondent no. 5 did not have the requisite and mandatory requirement of being a
graduate and then having special knowledge and professional experience of not less than twenty
years in consumer affairs, law, etc., is lacking and as such ineligible for consideration for
appointment as member, State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission;
iv) Because wrongful decision and recommendation for appointment qua the respondent no.5 has
been made by the Selection Committee for the post of member, State Commission despite knowing
well that respondent no.5 is ineligible for the post of member of State Commission in as much as
respondent no.5 did not have the requisite special knowledge and professional experience of not less
than twenty years in consumer affairs, law, public affairs, administration, economics, commerce,
industry, finance, management, engineering, technology, public health or medicine;
v) Because this experience of 'not less than twenty years' of the person shall mean experience of 'not
less than twenty years' of the person after attainment of the bachelors degree from a recognized
university and not the experience prior to obtainment/attainment of the bachelor's degree from a
recognized university;
vi) Because respondent no.5 is unqualified person for the post for which she was appointed to as
member, State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission;
vii) Because the two Experience Certificates dated 02.08.2003 and 08.04.2015, concerning the

East under the Ministry of Social Justice And Empowerment, Government of India run by
respondent no. 10 since 03.06.2005 to 06.04.2015, have been issued by respondent no. 10 falsely;
viii) Because besides there are other good grounds for filing the present petition.
[25] In the counter affidavit of the State respondents, it is stated that the Petitioner has admitted
that she applied for the post of President of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission
(District Commission). On the other hand the Private Respondent No. 5 namely, Smt. Athokpam
Nibedita Devi, applied for the post of Member of the State Commission and was selected for the said
post by the Selection Committee. As such, the Petitioner has no locus standi to challenge the
appointment of the Private Respondent No. 5 since she is not an aggrieved person and that no
fundamental or other legal rights have been infringed by appointing the Private Respondent No. 5.
On this ground alone, the present Writ Petition deserves outright dismissal.
[26] It is the submission of the learned GA that the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Calcutta Gas Company (Proprietary) Ltd.
-versus- The State of West Bengal and others [1962 AIR (SC) 1044] has held as follows:-
"..5. The legal right that can be enforced under Art. 32 must ordinarily be the right of
the petitioner himself who complains of infraction of Such right and approaches the
Court for relief. We do not see any reason why a different principle should apply in
the case of a petitioner under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The right that can be
enforced under Art. 226 also shall ordinarily be the personal or individual right of the
petitioner himself, though in the case of some of the writs like habeas corpus or quo
warrant this rule may have to be relaxed or modified. The question, therefore, İs
whether in the present case the petitioner has a legal right and whether it has been
infringed by the contesting respondents."
[27] It is also humbly submitted that the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the above referred case has been consistently followed in subsequent judgments.
That, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in N. Kannadasan -versus- Ajoy Khose & others [(2009) 7 SCC 1]
has also held that in Writ of Certiorari, a third party has no locus to canvass the legality or
correctness of the action. It is also further humbly submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in K.
Kumar Gupta -versus- Sri Marken da ya & Sri Omkareswara Swamy Temple & others [2022 5 SCC
710] has again reaffirmed that in order to have locus standi to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 226, an applicant should ordinarily be one who has a personal or individual right in
the subject-matter of the application.
[28] In view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above referred cases, the
Petitioner in the present Writ Petition has no locus to pray for issuance of a Writ in the nature of
Certiorari since the authority has not infringed any fundamental or other legal rights of the
petitioner by appointing the private respondent no. 5.

[29] It is stated in the preliminary objection vide MC(WP(C) 402 of 2023 of the respondent Nos. 5 &
10 that the petitioner has filed the above said writ petition before this Hon'ble Court praying for
issuance of the a writ of certiorari to quash/set aside the appointment order dated 21-03-2022 for
appointment of 3 Members of Manipur State Consumer Redressal Commission (State Commission)
and Presidents of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District Commission) Imphal,
Thoubal and Bishnupur. The main ground taken by the petitioner against the respondent No. 5 who
was appointed as a Member of the Manipur State Consumer Redressal Commission was that she did
not possess the requisite experience for appointment as a Member of the Manipur State Consumer
Redressal Commission. The State respondents have filed their affidavit-in-opposition to the said
writ petition wherein it was clearly stated that the experience certificate and documents of the
respondent No. 5 were duly verified and found to be correct and genuine and prayed for dismissal of
the said writ petition. The respondent Nos. 5 & 10 have filed their preliminary objection to the
abovesaid writ petition by raising the question of maintainability of the said writ petition and also
sought a leave to file an exhaustive affidavit-in-opposition if the said writ petition is found to be
maintainable.
[30] It is stated that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable for the reason that
she is not a candidate for the post of Members of the Manipur State Consumer Redressal
Commission (State Commission) and she did not apply for the said post. This factual position is
admitted by the petitioner herself in her writ petition. Therefore, in view of the judgment and order
of this Hon'ble Court dated 20-03-2014 passed in W.P(C) No. 695 of 2016 (L. Jayananda Singh
Versus The Secretary, Manipur Legislative Âssembly & 2 Ors.) (para No. 13 & 16), holding that the
writ petitioner does not have locus standi to challenge the appointment of the respondent No. 5. In
Para 16 of the said judgment, this Court has clearly held that as the petitioner of the said writ
petition has not applied for the post in pursuance to the related notification, he has no locus to
challenge the appointment of the respondent. The same ratio laid down in the said case by this
Hon'ble Court is applicable in the present case also. This Court has also relied the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of B. Srinivasa Reddy V. Karnataka Urban Water Supply
& Drainage Board Employees Association: (2006) 11 SCC 731 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has
clearly held that certiorari jurisdiction can be exercised only at the instance of a person who is
qualified to the post and who is a candidate for the post.
[31] It is the contention of Mr. Kh. Tarunkumar, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.5 that
as the petitioner is not qualified for the post of Member of the Manipur State Consumer Redressal
Commission and also she is not a candidate for the said post, she cannot seek for a relief under the
writ of certiorari to quash and set aside the appointment of the respondent No. 5. The writ petition
filed by the petitioner is not maintainable in view of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India and the order of this Court and as such, the same is liable to be dismissed
without entering into the merit of the case.
[32] Further, it is pointed out that if the issue of maintainability is raised in a writ petition, the same
must be decided first before entering into the merit of the case. This settled position of law has been
laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Security Exchange Board of India
versus Mangalore Stock Exchange reported in (2005)10 SCC 274. In the said case, the Hon'ble Apex
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76061136/ 12
Z. Michael Zimik Aged About 60 Years vs The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... on 20 December, 2024
Court has clearly held that once a case has been challenged as not maintainable, it should dispose of
the issue of maintainability first before passing any further order. A similar view was also taken by
the Hon' ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Union of India Versus Ranbir Singh Rathaur &
Ors. reported in (2006) 11 696 relevant para 42. In the said case also, the Hon'ble Apex Court held
that if the issue of maintainability is raised in the writ petition, the same should be decided first
before going into merit.
[33] In view of the aforesaid settled position of law, the maintainability issue raised by the
respondent No. 5 & 10 may kindly be decided first. And, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is
not at all maintainable as she is not a candidate for the post of Member of the Manipur State
Consumer Redressal Commission and she is also not eligible for the said post. Hence, the writ
petition filed by the petitioner is liable to be dismissed with exemplary cost for filing a frivolous
petition.
[34] In the counter affidavit of the respondent No.6, it is stated that the writ petition is not
maintainable as the petitioner has applied for the post of President of District Commission only and
she cannot challenge the appointment of the respondents as Members of State Commission. It is
pointed out that she lacks locus standi to file the present writ petition, as the petitioner is not an
aggrieved person.
[35] This Court considers the materials on record, the submissions made at bar and relevant law in
this regard including case law relied by the parties.
[36] In WP(C) No. 264 of 2022, the only ground for challenge is appointment of two female
Members in the State Commission in excess of one post advertised in the Notification dated
08-11-2021. However, with the admitted fact of issuance of Corrigendum dated 11-11-2021 of
making at least one female Member, the cause in the writ petition does not exists as more than one
female Member can be appointed. Accordingly, writ petition is dismissed.
[37] In WP(C) No. 686 of 2022, the petitioner is an applicant for the post of the President in District
Commission and she has challenged the appointment of the respondent No.5 as Member of the
State Commission. In fact, she is not an aggrieved party, as she is not an applicant and has no locus
to challenge the appointment of the respondent No.5 in view of the settled proposition of law as
referred herein above. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed as not maintainable. Misc.
application is disposed of. Since the writ petition is not maintainable, the question of eligibility of
the respondent No.5 is not gone into in the present case.
[38] In terms of the discussions in para 36 and 27, the writ petitions are dismissed.
