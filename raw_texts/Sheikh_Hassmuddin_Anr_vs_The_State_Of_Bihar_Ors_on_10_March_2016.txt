Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
CORAM: HONOURABLE THE ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE
and
2
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN SINGH
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN SINGH) Date: 10-03-2016 An
order, dated 30.06.2013, passed by a learned single Judge in a proceeding under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, whereby he has dismissed the writ application registered as CWJC No. 6871 of
2015, is being assailed in the present appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of this High
Court. The appellant Nos.1 and 2, herein, who were the writ petitioners before learned single Judge,
were elected to the posts of Up-pramukh/Pramukh of Panchayat Samiti, Ramnagar in the District of
West Champaran (hereinafter referred to as "Panchayat Samiti"). Consequent upon motion of no
confidence brought against them, having been passed by operation of Section 44(3) (i) of the Bihar
Gram Panchayat Raj Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the â€žAct of 2006(cid:129)), they have been
deemed to have vacated their offices. The appellants had, in the writ proceeding before learned
single Judge, questioned the legality of the very requisition, presented by the members of the
Panchayat Samiti, calling for a special meeting, to move no confidence motion. The plea of the
appellants did not find favour with the learned single Judge and accordingly the writ application
filed by the appellants came to be dismissed, by the order under appeal.
2. The cardinal point which is required to be addressed to in the present case is as to whether before
calling special meeting for moving no confidence against the appellants, there has been proper
compliance of statutory requirements of Section 44(3) (i) of the Act or not. Before coming to the
main issue, the facts of the case are essentially required to be taken note of which are as under:-
As it emerges from the materials on record over which there is no dispute, the
Members of the Panchayat Samiti had earlier presented a requisition to the Block
Development Officer-cum-Executive Officer of Panchayat Samiti (hereinafter
referred to as the Executive Officer) on 10.07.2014, calling for special meeting in
order to move no confidence motion against the appellants. The Executive Officer
had sent the said requisition to the appellants on 11.07.2014 and since the Pramukh
(Appellant No.2), did not convene the meeting, he fixed 14.08.2014 as the date of
special meeting, for moving no confidence motion. In the meeting held on
14.08.2014, the Panchayat Samiti passed no confidence motion against the
appellants. The passing of the motion of no confidence against the appellants was
thereafter, questioned by the appellants by filing an application under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India, which had given rise to CWJC No. 14526 of 2014. The
challenge was based mainly on three grounds. The main ground of challenge was that
requisition was not presented to the Pramukh in the manner prescribed under
Section 44(3) (i) of the Act. They also asserted that the charges for moving no
confidence motion against them were vague and there was no discussion on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38218679/ 2
Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
allegation. By an order, dated 10.02.2015, a learned single Judge of this Court had
dismissed the writ application. The appellants thereafter, had preferred an appeal
under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of this Court against the said order, dated
10.02.2015, passed by the learned single Judge, which had given rise to LPA No. 484
of 2015. A Division Bench of this Court upheld the contention on behalf of the
appellants that requisition for convening special meeting or introducing no
confidence motion was not presented in the manner prescribed under the Act. The
Division Bench, accordingly, by an order, dated 01.04.2015, set aside the judgment
and order of learned single Judge and left it open for the requisitionists, to take fresh
steps for convening meeting in this regard, in accordance with law.
3. The Members of the Panchayat Samiti are again said to have presented requisition for convening
special meeting, a copy of which was attempted to be served upon the appellant No.2, in his capacity
as Pramukh of the Panchayat Samiti as required under Section 44(3) (i) of the Act. It is the case of
the contesting respondents that the Pramukh was not found present in the office, right from the date
when a Division Bench of this Court by an order, dated 01.04.2015 had set aside no confidence
motion passed against him. A copy of the said requisition was sent to the Executive Officer, as per
the mandate of Section 44(3) (i) of the Act.
4. On the other hand, it is the case of the appellants that they received certified copy of the Division
Bench order, dated 01.04.2015, only on 10.05.2015 and in the meanwhile, despite their repeated
requests, the Executive Officer of the Panchayat Samiti did not allow them to join their respective
posts. It is their further case that the appellant No.2 joined the office of Pramukh on 16.04.2015 and
that none of the requisitionists had ever visited the office of Pramukh for presenting the requisition
for no confidence motion to the Pramukh as required under Section 44(3) (i) of the Act.
5. It has come on record, that in the absence of the Pramukh (Appellant No.2), the requisition was
filed in her office, a copy of which was duly received by an employee, in the office of the Pramukh.
6. As the Pramukh did not fix a date of special meeting on the request of the Members of the
Panchayat Samiti, the Executive Officer-cum-Block Development Officer notified 13.05.2015 as the
date of special meeting, through a communication, dated 02.05.2015.
7. As has been noted above, the requisition of Members of the Panchayat Samiti, for convening a
special meeting, a copy of which was forwarded to the Executive Officer, was sent by the Executive
Officer to the Pramukh. The appellant no.2, i.e., the Pramukh, again, despite the fact that she was in
receipt of the requisition on 16.04.2015, when she is said to have joined the office after the Division
Bench decision of this Court had setting aside the passing of no confidence motion against the
appellants, had not convened meeting.
8. Before the Executive Officer issued the said letter, dated 02.05.2015, convening special meeting
on 13.05.2015, the appellants approached this Court by filing an application under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, on 30.04.2015, seeking quashing of the requisition, dated 13.05.2015 itself,
sent by the Executive Officer, on the request of the Members of the Panchayat Samiti. They asserted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38218679/ 3
Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
that earlier also the requisition of the Panchayat Samiti was presented directly to the Executive
Officer which was acted upon by the Executive Officer by convening a special meeting in which no
confidence motion was illegally passed against the appellants; which was set aside by a Division
Bench of this Court, vide order, dated 01.04.2015. With a case that oblivious of the reasons assigned
by the Division Bench of this Court for holding no confidence motion passed against the appellants
to be illegal, the requisitionists/Members of the Panchayat Samiti again directly presented their
requisition to the Block Development Officer without presenting it to the appellant No.2 ( Pramukh)
in writing.
9. On the date fixed for special meeting vide notice, dated 02.05.2015, i.e., 13.05.2015; the motion of
no confidence was again passed against the appellants No. 1 and 2 unseating them from the post of
Up-pramukh/Pramukh respectively. It would be suitable to mention here that during the pendency
of the writ application, i.e., CWJC No. 6871 of 2015, fresh election for the post of Pramukh and
Up-pramukh was held. Smt. Jonia Devi and Smt. Nirmala Devi came to be elected as
Pramukh/Up-pramukh of the concerned Panchayat Samiti. By way of seeking amendment of relief,
the appellants questioned their election through I. A. No. 4915 of 2015 filed in CWJC No. 6871 of
2015.
10. The appellants questioned the legality of the process adopted by the Members of the Panchayat
Samiti requisitioning a special meeting mainly on the ground that since it was not presented to the
Pramukh as required under Section 44(3) (i) of the Act, the entire process stood vitiated which
included convening of the special meeting, on 13.05.2015, passing of no confidence motion in the
said meeting and subsequent election of Smit Jonia Devi and Smt. Nirmala Devi as
Pramukh/Up-pramukh respectively. The other plea which was taken on behalf of the appellants in
the writ proceeding was to the effect that the Executive Officer interfered with the proceedings of the
special meeting held on 13.05.2015.
11. Learned single Judge by order, dated 30.06.2015, under appeal, negatived both the pleas and
accordingly dismissed the writ application.
12. In this background, the present appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the High Court
has been preferred by the appellants against the said judgment and order of learned single Judge.
13. We have heard Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan and Mr. Harun Quareshi, learned Counsel, appearing
on behalf of the appellants, and Mr. Ravindra Kumar and Dr. Anshuman, learned Counsel,
appearing on behalf of the contesting respondents.
14. Before we come to the grounds taken on behalf of the appellants to assail the judgment and order
under appeal, we consider it proper to reproduce Section 44(3) (i) of the Act, which reads thus:-
"44. Resignation and Removal of Pramukh and Up-
Pramukh.- (1) xxxx xxxx xxxx
(2) xxxx xxxx xxxx
(3) (i) A Pramukh/Up-Pramukh of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38218679/ 4
Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
Panchayat Samiti shall be deemed to have vacated his office forthwith if a resolution
expressing want of confidence in him is passed by a majority of the total number of
elected members of the Panchayat Samiti at a meeting specially convened for the
purpose. The requisition for such a special meeting shall be presented to the
Pramukh in writing with a copy to the Executive Officer of the Panchayat Samiti, by
not less than one third of the total number of members elected directly from the
territorial constituencies of the Panchayat Samiti. The Executive Officer shall
immediately bring the requisition to the notice of the Pramukh. The Pramukh shall
convene such meeting on a date falling within 15 days of such requisition. If the
Pramukh fails to call the special meeting, the Up-pramukh or one third of the total
number of directly elected members may fix a date for such meeting and require the
Executive Officer to give notice to the members and to take such action as may be
necessary to convene the meeting. The Executive Officer shall necessarily issue such
notice in time and convene the meeting. No such meeting shall be postponed once the
notice for the same has been issued. No quorum shall be required for the special
meeting convened to discuss no confidence motion."
15. It can be easily culled out from careful reading of the aforesaid provision as embodied under
Section 44(3(i) of the Act that first part of it prescribes deemed vacation of the office of
Pramukh/Up-pramukh in the event a resolution expressing want of confidence is passed by a
majority of the total number of elected members of the Panchayat Samiti, at a meeting specially
convened for the said purpose. The second part of the said provision deals with the manner in which
requisition is to be presented by at least one third of the total number of members elected directly
from the territorial constituencies of the Panchayat Samiti and the manner in which the special
meeting is required to be convened by the Pramukh or the Executive Officer. Following are the steps
and requirements which are prescribed in the second part of Section 44(3) (i) of the Act which need
be taken and fulfilled:-
(i) The requisition has to be presented to the Pramukh in writing with a copy to the
Executive Officer of the Panchayat Samiti by not less than one third of the total
number of members elected directly from the territorial constituencies of the
Panchayat Samiti.
(ii) A copy of such requisition is to be sent to the Executive Officer of the Panchayat
Samiti.
(iii) The Executive Officer is required to immediately bring the requisition to the
notice of the Pramukh.
(iv) The Pramukh is to convene such meeting on a date falling within fifteen days of
such representation.
(v) In the event of failure on the part of the Pramukh to call the special meeting, the
Up-pramukh or one third of the total number of directly elected members may fix
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38218679/ 5
Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
date for such meeting and require the Executive Officer to give notice to the members
and take such action as may be necessary to convene the meeting.
(vi) It is obligatory on the Executive Officer to issue such notice in time and convene
the meeting.
(vii) No such meeting can be postponed once the notice for it has been issued.
16. Having noticed the statutory requirement as enshrined under Section 44(3) (i) of the Act, we
find that the sole ground on which the appellants have questioned convening of special meeting and
the resolution expressing want of confidence in them passed by majority of members of Panchayat
Samiti is that whereas, presentation of requisition to the Pramukh for convening special meeting for
the said purpose is mandatory, in the present case the requisition was directly presented to the
Executive Officer, thus, vitiating the entire process.
17. Mr. Abdul Mannan Khan, learned Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellants, has
vehemently argued that similar was the situation when earlier resolution expressing want of
confidence in the appellants was passed by a majority of the elected members of the Panchayat
Samiti and that was the ground why a Division Bench of this Court by the judgment and order,
dated 01.04.2015, had declared passing of the said resolution, contrary to the provisions of Section
44(3) (i) of the Act. He submits that the requisitionists and Executive Officer, this time also
committed the same illegality. He has argued, accordingly, that the resolution passed in the special
meeting held on 13.05.2015 expressing want of confidence against the appellants and, thus,
unseating them from the post of Pramukh and Up-pramukh suffers from the same illegality and
ought to have been interfered with by learned single Judge.
18. We notice from the judgment under appeal that learned single Judge has considered and noticed
the order of the Division Bench, dated 01.04.2015, wherein the Division Bench dealt with the facts
and circumstances of that case and arrived at a conclusion that service of presentation of notice to
the Pramukh was a mandatory requirement under Section 44(3)
(i) of the Act, which was not adhered to, rendering all consequential acts to be illegal.
19. Considering the rival pleadings and materials on record, learned single Judge arrived at a
definite conclusion that unquestionably, the requisition was presented on 13.04.2015 in the office of
Pramukh as the Pramukh (Appellant No.1) had remained continuously absent right from the date of
Division Bench judgment and order, dated 01.04.2015, of this Court. Distinguishing the situation
which had existed in previous no confidence motion passed against the appellants, referring to the
Division Bench decision of this Court, dated 01.04.2015, learned single Judge recorded that since
the appellant No.2 (Pramukh) remained absent from his office for a period of fortnight, in the light
of liberty granted by Division Bench of this Court, the requisitionists had no other choice but to file
the requisition in the office of the Pramukh which was done on 13.04.2015 and which was received
by the Peon in the office of the Pramukh. Conforming to the requirement of Section 44(3) (i) of the
Act, the requisitionists endorsed a copy of the said requisition to the Executive Officer also, who in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38218679/ 6
Sheikh Hassmuddin & Anr vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 10 March, 2016
turn brought it to the notice of the Pramukh through letter, dated 13.04.2015. We find that the
Pramukh refused to take notice of the said requisition as is apparent from the Peon(cid:129)s report which
was brought on record by way of Annexure-H to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent
Nos. 6 to 18 in CWJC No. 6871 of 2015. When second attempt of service of notice was made, on
16.04.2015, she again raised an objection that requisition/notice was not in accordance with the
order passed in LPA No. 484 of 2015. Learned single Judge, accordingly recorded that this time
there was enough evidence to establish that the requisition was attempted to be served on Pramukh
and as he was not personally available, it was served in the office of the Pramukh with a copy of the
Executive Officer. Learned single Judge, with these reasonings dismissed the writ application.
20. Upon perusal of the materials on record, we have noticed that the appellants, in order to defeat
the very purpose of statutory prescriptions embodied under Section 44(3) (i) of the Act, firstly
attempted to avoid service of notice/requisition for the sole purpose of raising a technical plea that
without presentation of requisition to the Pramukh, no resolution expressing want of no confidence
motion could be passed.
21. We find in the present case that there are materials to indicate that attempts were taken to
present the requisition to the Pramukh and when he was not found present personally in her office,
a copy of it was presented in his office. Even if, it is accepted that the appellants got a certified copy
of the order, dated 01.04.2015 on 10.04.2015, there is no explanation as to why they did not resume
their office immediately thereafter. In any event, plea on their behalf that requisitionists did not
meet the Pramukh to present the requisition to her and, therefore, the entire exercise of passing of
resolution against the appellants is illegal, cannot be accepted. There are evidence on record that at
least on 13.04.2015, the requisition was presented in the office of the Pramukh. It was a legal duty
cast upon the Pramukh to convene a meeting within fifteen days of such requisition. When he joined
on 16.04.2015, he could have convened a meeting within the statutory time prescribed under the Act
as has been noted above which could have shown his bona fide. He failed to do so.
22. We do not find any illegality in the action of the Executive Officer by issuing notice on
02.05.2015, convening the meeting in accordance with the provisions contained in Section 44(3) (i)
of the Act. We, therefore, find no substance in the submissions advanced on behalf of the appellants
in the present case.
23. We do not find any error in the findings recorded by the learned single Judge, nor any legal
infirmity in the judgment and order under appeal.
24. This appeal stands, accordingly, dismissed.
25. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.
