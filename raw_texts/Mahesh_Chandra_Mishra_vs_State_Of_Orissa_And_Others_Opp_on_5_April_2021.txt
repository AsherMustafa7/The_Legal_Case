Mahesh Chandra Mishra .... Petitioner

-versus-
State of Orissa and Others .... Opp. Parties
CORAM:
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
JUSTICE B. P. ROUTRAY
ORDER
Order No. 5.04.2021
13. 1. This matter is taken up by video conferencing mode.
2. This petition is restored vide order passed today in CMAPL No.65 of 2021.
3. The prayers in the present petition by the Petitioner who borrowed the loan from the Orissa State
Financial Corporation (OSFC) but admittedly who was unable to repay, is that the letter dated 26th
November, 2009 issued by the OSFC calling upon him to clear the outstanding amount of Rs.47.69
lakhs, of which Rs.10.36 lakhs was towards principal, Rs.33.96 lakhs towards interest and Rs.3.37
lakhs towards other charges, should be quashed.
4. As the impugned notice itself states, despite several demand notices and loan recall notices, no
payment was made by the Petitioner. As a result, the OSFC on 21st November, 2002 was
constrained to take over the possession of Petitioner's unit, which had been mortgaged in its favour
under Section 29 of the // 2 // State Financial Corporation Act, 1951 ('SFC Act'). The impugned
notice states that if the outstanding is not paid then an auction would be held on 4th December,
2009 to dispose of the unit.
5. It appears that in the auction which was conducted, Opposite Party No.3 was the successful
bidder. Even before the present petition was filed the successful bidder was handed over possession
of the property in question. After the auction was concluded, the Petitioner made a representation

on 28th December, 2009 which obviously could not be entertained. Almost a year after the said
auction, the present petition was filed on 1st November, 2010 in which no interim order was passed
although notice was directed to be issued on 15th November, 2010.
6. When the case was listed on 22nd April, 2018 the following order was passed by this Court:
"Officer of the OSFC is present.
None appears on behalf of the Petitioner.
It is stated that the outstanding dues against the Petitioner is Rs.15,31,000/- and the
Petitioner has not approached the OSFC authorities for settlement of the outstanding
dues.
Registry is directed to give a copy of today's order to the learned counsel who is
appearing for the Petitioner in order to take instruction from the Petitioner regarding
the settlement of the outstanding dues."
7. The matter was placed thrice before the Lok Adalat, i.e. on 12th May, 2018, 28th July, 2018 and
18th August, 2018. On none // 3 // of the dates the Petitioner appeared. On 18th August 2018, the
Officer on Special Duty (Law) of the OSFC informed the Lok Adalat that in spite of communications
being sent to the Petitioner to come forward for negotiations, there was no response.
8. When the matter was listed on 23rd March, 2021 this Court passed the following orders:
"Learned counsel for the Petitioner seeks time to take instructions from the
Petitioner on whether in order to demonstrate his bona fide the Petitioner is
prepared to deposit Rs.15,31,000/-, which is the amount claimed by the Opposite
Party No.2, in this Court within the time granted by this Court for entertaining the
writ petition.
List on 24th march, 2021."
9. On the next date the Petitioner did not appear and the petition was dismissed for
non-prosecution.
10. However, today, an application was filed by the learned counsel for the Petitioner stating that he
did not expect that the petition would be taken up and therefore was not able to appear.
11. By a separate order passed today in CMAPL No.65 of 2021 the petition was restored to file.
12. When a pointed question was asked to Mr. Pattanaik whether the Petitioner was willing to
deposit a sum of Rs.15,31,000/- in order to demonstrate his bonafides. Mr. Pattanaik stated that the
Petitioner is not in a position to make any payment. He sought to urge that the OSFC had acted

illegally in putting the unit to auction in 2009.
// 4 //
13. Having examined the petition carefully and considered the submissions of Mr. Pattaniak the
Court is not persuaded that any illegality has been committed by OSFC in seeking repayment of dues
and taking over possession of the Petitioner's unit by invoking Section 29 of OFC Act, 1951.
14. The Court is unable to find any merit in the petition and accordingly the petition is dismissed.
15. The prayer of the Petitioner for return of his collateral property is also rejected.
16. The I.A. is dismissed.
17. As the restrictions due to the COVID-19 situation are continuing, learned counsel for the parties
may utilize a soft copy of this order available in the High Court's website or print out thereof at par
with certified copy in the manner prescribed, vide Court's Notice No.4587, dated 25th March, 2020.
