THESE PETITIONS, COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY,
ORDER WAS MADE THEREIN AS UNDER:
CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.NAGAPRASANNA
ORAL ORDER
The petitioners in all these cases, inter alia, call in question the notice issued by the jurisdictional
Assessing Officer contending that it is without jurisdiction as the notice had to emerge in a faceless
manner. Since the issue of jurisdiction being common in all these cases, they are taken up together
and considered by this common order.
2. Facts, in brief, germane are as follows:
IN WRIT PETITION NO.28182 OF 2024:
The petitioner is an individual. He files his return of income for the assessment year
2017-18 on 02-11-2017 declaring total income of (cid:128)1,24,22,910/-. The 1st respondent
issued notice under Section 148A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to
as 'the Act' for short) on NC: 2025:KHC:33738 HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER 16-02-2024
holding that a search and seizure operation under Section 132 of the Act was
conducted in the case of M/s AMR India Private Limited and others on 02-05-2018,
and as a part of the search operation M/s.YHR Infra Projects was surveyed under
Section 133A of the Act. During the course of assessment proceedings of Sri
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 6
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
Yedugundla H.Reddy, it is noticed that he had purchased property from the
petitioner and paid an amount of (cid:128)2,19,00,000/- out of which, (cid:128)44,99,850 was paid
in cash. Therefore, in terms of Section 148A(a) of the Act, the petitioner was required
to furnish information and documents concerning the assessment year 2017-18. The
petitioner submits his reply contending that the information available through
insight portal is regarding sale of immovable property. The petitioner has sold his
undivided share in the immovable property for a sale consideration as explained by
the petitioner. The respondent issues a show cause notice under Section 148A(b) of
the Act on 28-02-2024 in accordance with Risk Management Strategy formulated by
the Board. The information was received by the petitioner through insight portal
wherein, search and seizure operation conducted in the year 2018, comes to the
knowledge of the petitioner. The NC: 2025:KHC:33738 HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
petitioner in response to the notice filed a reply in the income tax portal on
08.03.2024, urging several contentions. The contentions were all touching upon the
jurisdiction. One notice issued with regard to jurisdiction was when the notice had to
be issued on escaped assessment. The notice could not be issued in a physical manner
by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer after the notification of the Government of
India dated 29-03-2022, which mandated that the notice should be through faceless
regime. This is not the only contention in the case at hand. The petitioner has urged
several other contentions to buttress his submissions towards quashment of
proceedings.
In WRIT PETITION NO.17352 OF 2022:
3. The petitioner calls in question certain instructions issued on 11-05-2022 by the 1st
respondent/Central Board of Direct Taxes and a notice issued under Section 148 of the Act.
The petitioner is a Company engaged in the business of providing services for design support and
development of application solutions for semiconductor products and providing marketing support
services to the group companies. The petition challenges the notice issued by the 2nd respondent
- 10 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
against a non-existing entity AMD India Private Limited seeking to reopen the assessment for the
assessment year 2017-18.
Here again, the petitioner has projected plethora of grounds in challenge to the notice so issued and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 7
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
further proceedings taken by the respondent - one such ground is the notice suffering lack of
jurisdiction inasmuch as, after faceless regime, the proceedings could not have been initiated by the
jurisdictional Assessing Officer.
In WRIT PETITION NO.26203 OF 2024:
4. The subject petition is by an individual. The petitioner is at the doors of this Court calling in
question a notice so issued by the 1st respondent/Income Tax Officer under Section 148A(b) of the
Act on the contention that it is without jurisdiction. In the subject petition no other ground is urged
except the jurisdictional aspect qua faceless regime.
5. Thus, in all these cases, one common stream of challenge that runs through is, challenge to the
jurisdictional
- 11 -

issue qua the notice issued on initiation of proceedings under Section 148A (a) & (b) of the Act.
6. Heard Sri A.Shankar, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.No.28182 of
2024; Sri K.K. Chythanya, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.No.17352 of
2022; Sri T. Suryanarayana, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in W.P.No.26203 of

and 26203 of 2024 and Sri Y.V.Ravi Raj, learned counsel appearing for respondents in Writ Petition
No.17352 of 2022.
7. Sri K.K.Chythanya, learned senior counsel and Sri A. Shankar, learned senior counsel heading the
submissions would contend that the Government of India notifies faceless regime in terms of the
Notification dated 29-03-2022. On and from 29-03-2022, if proceedings are to be initiated under
Section 148 of the Act it should be e-assessment of the income escaping assessment under

Assessment Scheme, 2022 (for short ' the Scheme'). Learned senior counsel representing the
petitioners in all the petitions, would submit that several High Courts have considered this issue and
the division benches of several High Courts have held that faceless regime has to prevail. But, the
matters are pending before the Apex Court. In the light of the matter being pending before the Apex
Court, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners in all the petitions would submit that this Court
should follow two division bench judgments - one of High Court of Madras and the other of High
Court of Telangana, which have quashed the proceedings, reserving liberty to the revenue to re-open
the proceedings, in the event, the Apex Court would hold in favour of the revenue. They would
submit that all other contentions other than the issue relating to faceless regime be kept open on
revival of those proceedings, which the division benches have held so. They would seek similar order
to be passed at the hands of this Court.
8. Learned counsel appearing for the revenue in all the petitions, would though refute the
submissions contending that
- 13 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
there are High Courts which have held in favour of the revenue.
They place reliance upon the judgment of the High Court of Delhi, wherein, interpreting the very
provision holds that it need not be by faceless regime alone, it can be by both. They would however,
contend that all the other contentions be left open to be urged after the Apex Court decides the
issue.
9. In the light of the aforesaid submissions, it becomes necessary to leave open all other contentions
and consider the purport and impact of Notification dated 29-03-2022. For consideration of the said
issue, it becomes necessary to notice Sections 147 to 151A of the Act. They read as follows:
"147. Income escaping assessment.--If any income chargeable to tax, in the case of an
assessee, has escaped assessment for any assessment year, the Assessing Officer may,
subject to the provisions of Sections 148 to 153, assess or reassess such income or

Section 147 of the Act deals with assessment, re-
assessment and re-computation and on any escaped assessment for any assessment year, a notice
under Section 148 of the Act must be handed over to the assessee. Section 148A of the Act deals with
the procedure to be followed before issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act. Section 151A of
the Act confers power to the Central Government to formulate a scheme for the faceless assessment
of the income, which escape the assessment. It is here the Scheme is to be noticed. The Scheme was
then formulated in exercise of powers conferred under Section 151A of the Act at the hands of the
Government of India. It came into effect from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette,
which happens on 29-03-2022. The Scheme is as follows:

"Thus, the new provisions substituted by the Finance Act, 2021 being remedial and
benevolent in nature and substituted with a specific aim and object to protect the
rights and interest of the assessee as well as and the same being in public interest, the
respective High Courts have rightly held that the benefit of new provisions shall be
made available even in respect of the proceedings relating to past assessment years,
provided section 148 notice has been issued on or after April 1, 2021. We are in
complete agreement with the view taken by the various High Courts in holding so.
However, at the same time, the judgments of the several High Courts would result in
no reassessment proceedings at all, even if the same are permissible under the
Finance Act, 2021 and as per substituted sections 147 to 151 of the Income- tax Act.
The Revenue cannot be made remediless and the object and purpose of reassessment
proceedings cannot be frustrated. It is true that due to a bona fide mistake and in
view of subsequent extension of time vide various notifications, the Revenue issued
the impugned notices under section 148 after the amendment was enforced with
effect from April 1, 2021, under the unamended section 148. In our view the same
ought not to have been issued under the unamended Act and ought to have been
issued under the substituted provisions of sections 147 to 151 of the Income-tax Act as
per the Finance Act, 2021. There appears to be genuine non-application of the
amendments as the officers of the Revenue may have been under a bona fide belief
that the amendments may not yet have been enforced. Therefore, we are of the
opinion that some leeway must be shown in that regard which the High Courts could
have done so. Therefore, instead of quashing and setting aside the reassessment
notices issued under the unamended provisions of the Income-tax Act, the High
Courts ought to have passed an order construing the notices issued under the
unamended Act/unamended provisions of the Income-tax Act as those deemed to
have been issued under section 148A of the Income-tax Act as per the new provisions
of section 148A and the Revenue ought to have been permitted to proceed further
with the reassessment proceedings as per the substituted

151 of the Income-tax Act and which may be available under the Finance Act, 2021

respective High Courts as under:
(i) The respective impugned section 148 notices issued to the respective assessees
shall be deemed to have been issued under section 148A of the Income-tax Act as
substituted by the Finance Act, 2021 and treated to be show-cause notices in terms of
section 148A(b). The respective Assessing Officers shall within thirty days from today
provide to the assessees the information and material relied upon by the Revenue so

Courts;
(iii) The Assessing Officers shall thereafter pass an order in terms of section 148A(d)
after following the due procedure as required under section 148A(b) in respect of
each of the concerned assessees;"
The Hon'ble Supreme Court further, in order to strike a balance between the rights of the Revenue
as well as the respective assessees ordered that the notices issued under section 148 of the
unamended Act to be deemed to have been issued under section 148A of the Income-tax Act as
substituted by the Finance Act, 2021, and also ordered for construing or treating the notices to be

20. Keeping the aforesaid view of the hon'ble Supreme Court, it would be relevant at this juncture to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 20
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
take note certain provisions of the Income-tax Act which stood amended with effect from 1-4-2021
by virtue of the Finance Act, 2021. Section 144B inserted by virtue of the Finance Act, 2021, with
effect from 1-4-2021 provides for faceless assessment and sub- section (1) of the said newly inserted
section 144B is an non-obstante clause. The relevant portion of sub-section (1) of section 144B
necessary for adjudication of the preliminary issue under consideration is reproduced herein under:
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provisions of this
Act, the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under sub- section (3) of section
143 or under section 144 or under section 147 as the case may be, with respect to the
cases referred to in sub-section (2), shall be made in a faceless manner as per the
following procedure, namely:--
(i) the National Faceless Assessment Centre shall assign the case selected for the
purposes of faceless assessment under this section to a specific assessment unit
through an automated allocation system;
(ii) the National Faceless Assessment Centre shall intimate the assessee that
assessment in his case shall be completed in accordance with the procedure laid
down under this section;
(iii) a notice shall be served on the assessee, through the National Faceless
Assessment Centre, under sub-section (2) of section 143 or under sub-section (1) of
section 142 and the assessee may file his response to such notice within the date
specified therein, to the National Faceless Assessment Centre which shall forward the
same to the assessment unit;"
21. In continuation to the aforesaid provisions, it would be relevant to take note of yet another
provision of law, i.e., sub-section (1) of section 151A which was inserted with effect from 1-11-2020.
It refers to faceless assessment of income escaping assessment which would
- 28 -

be relevant for better understanding of the issue being decided in the present batch of writ petitions,
which again for ready reference is being reproduced herein under:
"151A. (1) The Central Government may make a scheme, by notification in the Official
Gazette, for the purposes of assessment, reassessment or recomputation under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 21
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
section 147 or issuance of notice under section 148 or conducting of enquiries or
issuance of show- cause notice or passing of order under section 148A or sanction for
issue of such notice under section 151, so as to impart greater efficiency, transparency
and accountability by--
(a) eliminating the interface between the Income-
tax authority and the assessee or any other person to the extent technologically feasible;
(b) optimising utilisation of the resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation;
(c) introducing a team-based assessment, reassessment, recomputation or issuance or sanction of
notice with dynamic jurisdiction."
22. Similarly, the Central Board of Direct Taxes had also amended section 130 of the Income-tax Act
so far as conferring jurisdiction on the income- tax authorities in the light of the faceless assessment
procedure being adopted. The amended section 130 and sub-section (1) which is relevant for the
present issue under consideration again for ready reference is being reproduced herein under:
"(1) The Central Government may make a scheme, by notification in the Official
Gazette, for the purpose of--
(a) exercise of all or any of the powers and performance of all or any of the functions
conferred on, or, as the case may be, assigned to Income-tax authorities by or under
this Act as referred to in section 120; or
(b) vesting the jurisdiction with the Assessing Officer as referred to in section 124; or
- 29 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738 HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
(c) exercise of power to transfer cases under section 127; or
(d) exercise of jurisdiction in case of change of incumbency as referred to in section 129, so as to
impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability by--
(i) eliminating the interface between the Income- tax authority and the assessee or any other person,
to the extent technologically feasible;
(ii) optimising utilisation of the resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation;
(iii) introducing a team-based exercise of powers and performance of functions by two or more
Income- tax authorities, concurrently, in respect of any area or persons or classes of persons or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 22
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
incomes or classes of income or cases or classes of cases, with dynamic jurisdiction."
23. In furtherance to the powers conferred under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 130 of the
aforesaid Income-tax Act, the Central Board of Direct Taxes framed a scheme called as the "Faceless
Jurisdiction of Income- tax Authorities Scheme, 2022" ((2022) 442 ITR (St) 197 ). A plain reading of
the aforesaid notification would clearly reflect that as has been amended under section
130. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has framed a scheme which defines the Act to be the
Income-tax Act and it specifically defines automated allocation which is defined under section
2(1)(b), which again for ready reference is being re-produced herein under (page 197 of 442 ITR
(St)):
"In this Scheme, unless the context otherwise requires,--
(a) 'Act' means the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961);
(b) 'automated allocation' means an algorithm for randomised allocation of cases, by using suitable
technological tools, including
- 30 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a view to optimise the use of resources;"
Further section 3 of the said scheme deals with vesting of the jurisdiction with the
Assessing Officer, which again for ready reference is being reproduced herein under:
"(b) vesting the jurisdiction with the Assessing Officer as referred to in section 124 of
the Act, shall be in a faceless manner, through automated allocation, in accordance
with and to the extent provided in--
(i) section 144B of the Act with reference to making faceless assessment of total
income or loss of assessee;"
24. In furtherance to the aforesaid notification, the Central Board of Direct Taxes again in exercise
of its powers conferred under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 151A framed another scheme called
as the e- Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022 which defines automated
allocation is reproduced herein under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 23
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
"In this Scheme, unless the context otherwise requires,--
(a) 'Act' means the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961);
(b) 'automated allocation' means an algorithm for randomised allocation of cases, by
using suitable technological tools, including artificial intelligence and machine
learning, with a view to optimise the use of resources."
And the scope of the scheme again has been envisaged in section 3 of the said scheme, which again
for ready reference is being reproduced herein under:
"For the purpose of this Scheme,--
(a) assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147 of the Act,
- 31 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738 HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
(b) issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act, shall be through automated allocation, in
accordance with risk management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in section 148 of
the Act for issuance of notice, and in a faceless manner, to the extent provided in section 144B of the
Act with reference to making assessment or reassessment of total income or loss of assessee."
25. A plain reading of the aforesaid two notifications issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes
dated March 28, 2022 and March 29, 2022, it would clearly indicate that the Central Board of Direct
Taxes was very clear in its mind when it framed the aforesaid two schemes with respect to the
proceedings to be drawn under section 148A, that is to have it in a faceless manner. There were two
mandatory conditions which were required to be adhered to by the Department, firstly, the
allocation being made through the automated allocation system in accordance with the risk
management strategy formulated by the Board under section 148 of the Act. Secondly, the
reassessment has to be done in a faceless manner to the extent provided under section 144B of the
Act.
26. After the introduction of the above two schemes, it becomes mandatory for the Revenue to
conduct/initiate proceedings pertaining to reassessment under sections 147, 148 and 148A of the Act
in a faceless manner. Proceedings under section 147 and section 148 of the Act would now have to be
taken as per the procedure legislated by Parliament in respect of reopening/reassessment, i.e.,
proceedings under section 148A of the Act.
27. In the present case, both the proceedings, i.e., the impugned proceedings under section 148A of
the Act, as well as the consequential notices under section 148 of the Act were issued by the local
jurisdictional officer and not in the prescribed faceless manner. The order under section 148A(d) of
the Act and the notices under section

148 of the Act are issued on April 29, 2022, i.e., after the "Faceless Jurisdiction of the Income-tax
Authorities Scheme, 2022" and the "e-Assessment of Income Escaping Assessment Scheme, 2022"
were introduced.
28. From the aforegiven factual matrix, firstly the statutory provisions enumerated in the preceding
paragraphs and secondly, the subsequent direction given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case
of Ashish Agarwal, supra, what is clearly reflected is the fact that when the hon'ble Supreme Court
had partly allowed the petitions which were filed by the Union of India challenging the judgments of
various High Courts whereby the notices under section 148 of the unamended Act were set aside by
the High Courts, the hon'ble Supreme Court has only permitted the Union of India to proceed
further with the reassessment proceedings under the amended provisions of law, more particularly,
as amended by the Finance Act, 2021. It never intended the authorities concerned to continue with
the proceedings from the stage of the issuance of notices under section 148, nor is the direction to
that effect. And there cannot be any confusion, ambiguity or misconception for the
respondent-Department to have in this regard.
29. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has in paragraph 7 specifically held that the High Courts have
rightly held that the benefit of new provisions shall be made available in respect of the proceedings
relating to past assessment years. Further, the hon'ble Supreme Court again in paragraph 8 very
emphatically had said that the proceedings ought not to have been issued under the unamended Act.
Rather ought to have been issued under the substituted provisions as per the Finance Act, 2021.
Further, in the same paragraph clearly directed the Income-tax Department to proceed further as
per the Finance Act, 2021, subject to compliance of all the procedural requirements and defences
available to the assessee under the substituted provisions under the Finance Act, 2021. The fact that
the hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the notice earlier issued under section 148 be treated as notice
one under section 148A and further it was also to be treated

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 25
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
as the show-cause notice issued under section 148A(b) by itself establishes the fact the directions
given by the hon'ble Supreme Court for the respondent- Department was to proceed further in
accordance with the substituted provisions which stood introduced by the Finance Act, 2021.
30. In the instant case, undisputedly the respondent-Department has not proceeded against the
petitioner under the substituted provisions of the Finance Act, 2021. Rather, it proceeded with the
unamended provisions of law. This in other words takes the position back to the stage as it stood
when the initial notices under section 148 under the unamended provisions of law were issued. This
in other words also takes us to a position or a stage prior to the large number of writ petitions being
allowed across the country, approximately 9,000 in number and confirmed by the hon'ble Supreme
Court also vide the judgment of Ashish Agarwal, supra.
31. It is well settled principle of law that where the power is given to do certain things in certain way,
the thing has to be done in that way alone and not in any other manner which is otherwise not
provided under the law.
32. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahavir Prasad, (1999) 8 SCC
266 in paragraph 17 laying down the aforesaid principle held as under "it is well settled solitary
principle that if statute provides for a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it has to be done
in that manner and in no other manner. The said principle of law was further reiterated in the case
of Cherukuri Mani v. Chief Secretary, Government of Andhra Pradesh, (2015) 13 SCC 722, wherein,
again in paragraph 14, the aforesaid principle has been reinforced by the hon'ble Supreme Court
holding that "where law prescribe a thing to be done in a particular manner following a particular
procedure, it shall have to be done in the same manner following the provisions of law without
deviating from the prescribed procedure".The said principle

eyes of law. In paragraph 18 of the said judgment, the hon'ble Supreme Court held as under:

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
"The Tribunal's judgment has proceeded on the basis that even though the samples
were drawn contrary to law, the appellants would be estopped because their
representative was present when the samples were drawn and they did not object
immediately. This is a completely perverse finding both on fact and law. On fact, it
has been more than amply proved that no representative of the appellant was, in fact,
present at the time the customs inspector took the samples. Shri K.M. Jani who was
allegedly present not only stated that he did not represent the clearing agent of the
appellants in that he was not their employee but also stated that he was not present
when the samples were taken. In fact, therefore, there was no representative of the
appellants when the samples were taken. In law equally the Tribunal ought to have
realized that there can be no estoppel against law. If the law requires that something
be done in a particular manner, it must be done in that manner, and if not done in
that manner has no existence in the eye of law at all. The Customs Authorities are not
absolved from following the law depending upon the acts of a particular assessee.
Something that is illegal cannot convert itself into something legal by the act of a
third person."
33. If we look into the principle of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as enumerated in
the preceding paragraphs and when we look into the facts of the present case, it would clearly reflect
that Parliament had by virtue of the Finance Act,

2021, brought certain amendments to the
provisions of the Income-tax Act, more particularly, in respect of the manner in which the
reassessment and the procedure to be adopted by the Income-tax Department. The amendment was
brought with an intention to make the law more transparent and effective. The hon'ble Supreme
Court also while deciding the case of Ashish Agarwal, supra, as is discussed in the preceding
paragraph had specifically directed the Union of India to proceed further in terms of the substituted
provisions brought in by way of the Finance Act, 2021.
34. What is also relevant to take note of is the fact that the Hon'ble Supreme Court while exercising
its power under article 142 of the Constitution of India has also not relaxed the applicability of the
Finance Act, 2021. Rather, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in very clear and unambiguous terms had
held that the notices issued under the unamended provisions, which were struck down by the High
Court, shall be treated as a notice under new amended provisions and the Union of India was
directed to proceed further from that stage in terms of the amended provisions of law. In spite of
such specific clear directions by the hon'ble Supreme Court, the Union of India for reasons best

known again proceeded with the procedure as it stood prior to the amended provisions which came
into force from April 1, 2021.
35. In view of the aforesaid discussions, it is by now very clear that the procedure to be followed by
the respondent-Department upon treating the notices issued for reassessment being under section
148A, the subsequent proceedings were mandatorily required to be undertaken under the
substituted provisions as laid down under the Finance Act, 2021. In the absence of which, we are
constrained to hold that the procedure adopted by the respondent-Department is in contravention
to the statute, i.e., the Finance Act, 2021, at the first instance. Secondly, it is also in direct
contravention to the directives issued by the hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ashish Agarwal
supra.

36. For all the aforesaid reasons, the impugned notices issued and the proceedings drawn by the
respondent-Department is neither tenable, nor sustainable. The notices so issued and the procedure
adopted being per se illegal, deserves to be and are accordingly set aside/quashed. As a
consequence, all the impugned orders getting quashed, the consequential orders passed by the
respondent-Department pursuant to the notices issued under sections 147 and 148 would also get
quashed and it is ordered accordingly. The reason we are quashing the consequential order is on the
principles that when the initiation of the proceedings itself was procedurally wrong, the subsequent
orders also gets nullified automatically.
37. The preliminary objection raised by the petitioner is sustained and all these writ petitions stands
allowed on this very jurisdictional issue. Since the impugned notices and orders are getting quashed
on the point of jurisdiction, we are not inclined to proceed further and decide the other issues raised
by the petitioner which stands reserved to be raised and contended in an appropriate proceedings.
38. Since the hon'ble Supreme Court had, in the case of Ashish Agarwal supra, as a one-time
measure exercising the powers under article 142 of the Constitution of India, permitted the Revenue
to proceed under the substituted provisions, and this court allowing the petitions only on the
procedural flaw, the right conferred on the Revenue would remain reserved to proceed further if
they so want from the stage of the order of the Supreme Court in the case of Ashish Agarwal supra."

The High Court of Punjab and Haryana in JATINDER SINGH BHANGU v. UNION OF INDIA3 has
held as follows:
"12. The issue involved came up for consideration before a single judge Bench of the
Gauhati High Court in Ram Narayan Sah v. Union of India [(2024) 471 ITR 228
(Gauhati); (2024) 163 taxmann.com 478 (Gauhati).] . The court expressed the same
opinion as was formed by Telangana and Bombay High Courts. As per 1961 Act, every
assessee has to file annual return disclosing its total income, taxable income and tax
liability. In case the Assessing Officer disagrees with the disclosed income, he has
right to reassess the tax liability of the assessee. Reassessment cannot be made
without granting opportunity to the assessee. The opportunity is granted by way of
issuing notice followed by personal hearing. Sections 147, 148 and 148A contemplate
procedure of reassessment. Section 144B prescribes procedure of self assessment.
Section 151A provides that assessment of escaped income shall be made faceless. The
concept of self assessment has been introduced with effect from April 1, 2021. The
object of faceless assessment is to eliminate interface between the Income-tax
authority and assessee to the extent feasible. There are further objects as enshrined in
section 151A. Section 148 provides for issuance of notice where income has escaped
assessment. For ready reference, sections 148 and 151A of the 1961 Act are
reproduced as below:
"148. Issue of notice where income has escaped assessment.--
Before making the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147,
and subject to the provisions of section 148A, the Assessing Officer shall serve on the
assessee a notice, along with a copy of the order passed, if required, under clause (d)
of section 148A, requiring him to furnish within such period, as may be specified in

section 148 can be issued by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer. In support of his contention, they
heavily relied upon Office Memorandum dated February 20, 2023 and letter dated January 19, 2024
issued by the Directorate of Income-tax (System).
15. From the perusal of section 151A, it is quite evident that the scheme of faceless assessment is
applicable from the stage of show- cause notice under section 148 as well as section 148A. Clause
3(b) of notification dated March 29, 2022 issued under section 151A clearly provides that scheme
would be applicable to notice under section 148. Even otherwise, it is a settled proposition of law
that assessment proceedings commence from the stage of issuance of show- cause notice. The object
of introduction of faceless assessment would be defeated if show-cause notice under section 148 is
issued by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer. The respondents are heavily placing reliance upon the
office memorandum and letter issued by the Departmental authorities. It is axiomatic in tax
jurisprudence that circulars, instructions and letters issued by the Board or any other authority
cannot override statutory provisions. The circulars are binding upon the authorities and the courts
are not bound by such circulars. The mandate of sections 144B, 151A read with notification dated
March 29, 2022 issued thereunder is quite lucid. There is no ambiguity in the language of statutory
provisions, thus, the office memorandum or any other instruction issued by the Board or any other
authority cannot be relied upon. Instructions/circulars can supplement but cannot supplant
statutory provisions."

Section 151A of the Act gives the power to the Central Board of Direct Taxes ("CBDT") to notify the
Scheme for :
(i) the purpose of assessment, reassessment or recomputation under Section 147;
(ii) issuance of notice under Section 148; or
(iii) conducting of inquiry or issuance of show cause notice or passing of order under Section 148A;
or
(iv) sanction for issuance of notice under Section 151;
so as to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability by inter alia eliminating the
interface between the Income Tax Authorities and assessee. Sub- section 3 of Section 151A of the Act
also provides that every notification issued under sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 151A of the Act
shall be laid before each House of Parliament.
In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 151A of the Act, CBDT
issued a notification dated 29th March, 2022 [Notification No.18/2022/F. No.370142/16/2022-TPL

(a) the assessment, reassessment or recomputation under Section 147 of the Act,

accordance with risk management strategy formulated by the Board as referred to in Section 148 of

respondent no.1 (JAO) and not by the Gauri Gaekwad 64/87 904.WP-1778-2023.doc NFAC, which
is not in accordance with the aforesaid Scheme.
33.The guideline dated 1st August 2022 relied upon by the Revenue is not applicable because these
guidelines are internal guidelines as is clear from the endorsement on the first page of the guideline
- "Confidential For Departmental Circulation Only". The said guidelines are not issued under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 35
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
Section 119 of the Act. Any such guideline issued by the CBDT is not binding on petitioner. Further
the said guideline is also not binding on respondent no.1 as they are contrary to the provisions of the
Act and the Scheme framed under Section 151A of the Act. The effect of a guideline came up for
discussion in Sofitel Realty LLP vs. Income Tax Officer (TDS)13 wherein this Court has held that the
guidelines which are contrary to the provisions of the Act cannot be relied upon by the Revenue to
reject an application for compounding filed by an assessee. The Court held that guidelines are
subordinate to the principal Act or Rules, it cannot restrict or override the application of specific
provisions enacted by legislature. The guidelines cannot travel beyond the scope of the powers
conferred by the Act or the Rules.
The guidelines do not deal with or even refer to the Scheme dated 29th March 2022 framed by the
Government under Section 151A of the Act. Section 151A(3) of the Act provides that the Scheme so
framed is required to be laid before each House of the Parliament. Therefore, the Scheme dated 29th
March 2022 under Section 151A of the Act, which has also been laid before the Parliament, would be
binding on the Revenue and the guideline dated 1st August 2022 cannot supersede the Scheme and
if it provides anything to the contrary to the said Scheme, then the same is required to be treated as
invalid and bad in law.

34. As regards ITBA step-by-step Document No.2 regarding issuance of notice under Section 148 of
the Act, relied upon by Revenue, an internal document cannot depart from the explicit statutory
provisions of, or supersede the Scheme framed by the Government under Section 151A of the Act
which Scheme is also placed before both the Houses of Parliament as per Section 151A(3) of the Act.
This is specially the case when the document does not even consider or even refer to the Scheme.
Further the said document is clearly intended to be a manual/guide as to how to use the Income Tax
Department's portal, and does not even claim to be a statement of the Revenue's position/stand on
the issue in question. Our observations with respect to the guidelines dated 1st August 2022 relied
upon by the Revenue will equally be applicable here.
35. Further, in our view, there is no question of concurrent jurisdiction of the JAO and the FAO for
issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act or even for passing assessment or reassessment
order. When specific jurisdiction has been assigned to either the JAO or the FAO in the Scheme
dated 29th March, 2022, then it is to the exclusion of the other. To take any other view in the
matter, would not only result in chaos but also render the whole faceless proceedings redundant. If
the argument of Revenue is to be accepted, then even when notices are issued by the FAO, it would
be open to an assessee to make submission before the JAO and vice versa, which is clearly not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 36
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
contemplated in the Act. Therefore, there is no question of concurrent jurisdiction of both FAO or
the JAO with respect to the issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act. The Scheme dated 29th
March 2022 in paragraph 3 clearly provides that the issuance of notice "shall be through automated
allocation " which means that the same is mandatory and is required to be followed by the
Department and does not give any discretion to the Department to choose whether to follow it or
not. That automated allocation is defined in paragraph 2(b) of the Scheme to mean an algorithm for
randomised allocation of cases by using suitable technological tools including artificial

intelligence and machine learning with a view to optimise the use of resources. Therefore, it means
that the case can be allocated randomly to any officer who would then have jurisdiction to issue the
notice under Section 148 of the Act. It is not the case of respondent no.1 that respondent no.1 was
the random officer who had been allocated jurisdiction.
36. With respect to the arguments of the Revenue, i.e., the notification dated 29th March 2022
provides that the Scheme so framed is applicable only 'to the extent' provided in Section 144B of the
Act and Section 144B of the Act does not refer to issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act and
hence, the notice cannot be issued by the FAO as per the said Scheme, we express our view as
follows:-
Section 151A of the Act itself contemplates formulation of Scheme for both
assessment, reassessment or recomputation under Section 147 as well as for issuance
of notice under Section 148 of the Act. Therefore, the Scheme framed by the CBDT,
which covers both the aforesaid aspect of the provisions of Section 151A of the Act
cannot be said to be applicable only for one aspect, i.e., proceedings post the issue of
notice under Section 148 of the Act being assessment, reassessment or recomputation
under Section 147 of the Act and inapplicable to the issuance of notice under Section
148 of the Act. The Scheme is clearly applicable for issuance of notice under Section
148 of the Act and accordingly, it is only the FAO which can issue the notice under
Section 148 of the Act and not the JAO.
The argument advanced by respondent would render clause 3(b) of the Scheme otiose and to be
ignored or contravened, as according to respondent, even though the Scheme specifically provides
for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act in a faceless manner, no notice is required to be
issued under Section 148 of the Act in a faceless manner.

In such a situation, not only clause 3(b) but also the first two lines below clause 3(b) would be
otiose, as it deals with the aspect of issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act. Respondents,
being an authority subordinate to the CBDT, cannot argue that the Scheme framed by the CBDT,
and which has been laid before both House of Parliament is partly otiose and inapplicable. The
argument advanced by respondent expressly makes clause 3(b) otiose and impliedly makes the
whole Scheme otiose. If clause 3(b) of the Scheme is not applicable, then only clause 3(a) of the
Scheme remains. What is covered in clause 3(a) of the Scheme is already provided in Section
144B(1) of the Act, which Section provides for faceless assessment, and covers assessment,
reassessment or recomputation under Section 147 of the Act. Therefore, if Revenue's arguments are
to be accepted, there is no purpose of framing a Scheme only for clause 3(a) which is in any event
already covered under faceless assessment regime in Section 144B of the Act. The argument of
respondent, therefore, renders the whole Scheme redundant. An argument which renders the whole
Scheme otiose cannot be accepted as correct interpretation of the Scheme. The phrase "to the extent
provided in Section 144B of the Act" in the Scheme is with reference to only making assessment or
reassessment or total income or loss of assessee. Therefore, for the purposes of making assessment
or reassessment, the provisions of Section 144B of the Act would be applicable as no such manner
for reassessment is separately provided in the Scheme. For issuing notice, the term "to the extent
provided in Section 144B of the Act"
is not relevant. The Scheme provides that the notice under Section 148 of the Act,
shall be issued through automated allocation, in accordance with risk management
strategy formulated by the Board

as referred to in Section 148 of the Act and in a faceless manner. Therefore, "to the
extent provided in Section 144B of the Act" does not go with issuance of notice and is
applicable only with reference to assessment or reassessment. The phrase "to the
extent provided in Section 144B of the Act" would mean that the restriction provided

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
in Section 144B of the Act, such as keeping the International Tax Jurisdiction or
Central Circle Jurisdiction out of the ambit of Section 144B of the Act would also
apply under the Scheme. Further the exceptions provided in sub-section (7) and (8)
of Section 144B of the Act would also be applicable to the Scheme.
37. When an authority acts contrary to law, the said act of the Authority is required to
be quashed and set aside as invalid and bad in law and the person seeking to quash
such an action is not required to establish prejudice from the said Act. An act which is
done by an authority contrary to the provisions of the statue, itself causes prejudice to
assessee. All assessees are entitled to be assessed as per law and by following the
procedure prescribed by law. Therefore, when the Income Tax Authority proposes to
take action against an assessee without following the due process of law, the said
action itself results in a prejudice to assessee. Therefore, there is no question of
petitioner having to prove further prejudice before arguing the invalidity of the
notice.
38. With respect to the Office Memorandum dated 20th February 2023, the said
Office Memorandum merely contains the comments of the Revenue issued with the
approval of Member (L&S) CBDT and the said Office Memorandum is not in the
nature of a guideline or instruction issued under Section 119 of the Act so as to have
any binding effect on the Revenue. Moreover, the arguments advanced by the
Revenue on the said Office
- 50 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
Memorandum dated 20th February 2023 is clearly contrary to the provisions of the
Act as well as the Scheme dated 29 th March 2022 and the same are dealt with as
under -
(i) It is erroneously stated in paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum that "The
scheme clearly lays down that the issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act has
to be through automation in accordance with the risk management strategy referred
to in section 148 of the Act." The issuance of notice is not through automation but
through "automated allocation". The term "automated allocation" is defined in clause
2(1)(b) of the said Scheme to mean random allocation of cases to Assessing Officers.
Therefore, it is clear that the Assessing Officer are randomly selected to handle a case
and it is not merely a case where notice is sought to be issued through automation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 39
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
(ii) It is further erroneously stated in paragraph 3 of the Office Memorandum that
"To this end, as provided in the section 148 of the Act, the Directorate of Systems
randomly selects a number of cases based on the criteria of Risk Management
Strategy ." The term 'randomly' is further used at numerous other places in the Office
Memorandum with respect to selection of cases for consideration/issuance of notice
under Section 148 of the Act. Respondent is clearly incorrect in its understanding of
the said Scheme as the reference to random in the said Scheme is reference to
selection of Assessing Officer at random and not selection of Section 148 cases as
random. If the cases for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act are selected
based on criteria of the risk management strategy, then, obviously, the same are not
randomly selected. The term 'randomly' by definition mean something which is
chosen by chance rather than according to a plan.
Therefore, if the cases are chosen based on risk management strategy, they certainly
- 51 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
cannot be said to be random. The
Computer/System cannot select cases on random but selection can be based on certain well- defined
criteria. Hence, the argument of respondents is clearly unsustainable. If the case of respondent is
that the applicability of Section 148 of the Act is on random basis, then the provision of Section 148
itself would become contrary to Article 14 of the Constitution of India as being arbitrary and
unreasonable. Randomly selecting cases for reopening without there being any basis or criteria
would mean that the section is applied by the Revenue in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner.
The word 'random' is used in clause 2(1)(b) of the said Scheme in the definition of "automated
allocation".
"Automated allocation" is defined in the said clause to mean "an algorithm for
randomised allocation of cases..... ". The term 'random', in our view, has been used in
the context of assigning the case to a random Assessing Officer, i.e., an Assessing
Officer would be randomly chosen by the system to handle a particular case. The
term 'random' is not used for selection of case for issuance of notice under Section
148 as has been alleged by the Revenue in the Office Memorandum. Further, in
paragraph 3.2 of the Office Memorandum, with respect to the reassessment
proceedings, the reference to 'random allocation' has correctly been made as random
allocation of cases to the Assessment Units by the National Faceless Assessment
Centre. When random allocation is with reference to officer for reassessment then the
same would equally apply for issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act.

(iii) The conclusion at the bottom of page 2 in paragraph 3 of the Office
Memorandum that "Therefore, as provided in the scheme the notice under section
148 of the Act is issued on automated allocation of cases to the Assessing Officer
based on the risk management criteria " is also factually
- 52 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738 HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER incorrect and on the basis of incorrect interpretation
of the Scheme. Clause 2(1)(b) of the Scheme defined 'automated allocation' to mean 'an algorithm
for randomised allocation of cases by using suitable technological tools, including artificial
intelligence and machine learning, with a view to optimise the use of resources '. The said definition
does not provide that the automated allocation of case to the Assessing Officer is based on the risk
management criteria. The reference to risk management criteria in clause 3 of the Scheme is to the
effect that the notice under Section 148 of the Act should be in accordance with the risk
management strategy formulated by the board which is in accordance with Explanation 1 to Section
148 of the Act. In our view, the Revenue is misinterpreting the Scheme, perhaps to cover its
deficiency of not following the Scheme for issuing notice under Section 148 of the Act.
(iv) In paragraph 3.1 of the Office Memorandum, it is stated that the case is selected prior to
issuance of notice are decided on the basis of an algorithm as per risk management strategy and are,
therefore, randomly selected. It is further stated that these cases are 'flagged' to the JAO by the
Directorate of Systems and the JAO does not have any control over the process. It is further stated
that the JAO has no way of predicting or determining beforehand whether the case will be 'flagged'
by the system. The contention of the Revenue is that only cases which are 'flagged' by the system as
per the risk management strategy formulated by CBDT can be considered by the Assessing Officer
for reopening, however, in clause (i) in the Explanation 1 to Section 148 of the Act, the term
"flagged" has been deleted by the Finance Act, 2022, with effect from 1 st April 2022. In any case,
whether only cases which are flagged can be reopened or not is not relevant to decide the scope of
the Scheme framed under Section 151A of the Act, which required the notice under Section 148 of
the Act to be issued on
- 53 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
the basis of random allocation and in a faceless manner.
(v) The Revenue has wrongly contended in paragraph 3.1 of the Office Memorandum that
"Therefore, whether JAO or NFAC should issue such notice is decided by administration keeping in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 41
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
mind the end result of natural justice to the assessees as well as completion of required procedure in
a reasonable time. " In our opinion, there is no such power given to the administration under either
Section 151A of the Act or under the said Scheme. The Scheme is clear and categorical that notice
under Section 148 of the Act shall be issued through automated allocation and in a faceless manner.
Therefore, the argument of the Revenue is clearly contrary to the provisions of the Scheme.
(vi) In paragraph 3.3 of the Office Memorandum, it is again erroneously stated that "Here it is
pertinent to note that the said notification does not state whether the notices to be issued by the
NFAC or the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer ("JAO")......It states that issuance of notice under
section 148 of the Act shall be through automated allocation in accordance with the risk
management strategy and that the assessment shall be in faceless manner to the extent provided in
section 144B of the Act." The Scheme is categoric as stated aforesaid that the notice under Section
148 of the Act shall be issued through automated allocation and in a faceless manner. The Scheme
clearly provides that the notice under Section 148 of the Act is required to be issued by NFAC and
not the JAO. Further, unlike as canvassed by Revenue that only the assessment shall be in faceless
manner, the Scheme is very clear that both the issuance of notice and assessment shall be in faceless
manner.
(vii) In paragraph 5 of the Office Memorandum, a completely unsustainable and illogical submission
has been made that Section 151A of the Act takes
- 54 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
into account that procedures may be modified under the Act or laid out taking into account the
technological feasibility at the time. Reading the said Scheme along with Section 151A of the Act
makes it clear that neither the Section or the Scheme speak about the detailed specifics of the
procedure to be followed therein. This argument of the Revenue is clearly contrary to the Scheme as
the Scheme is very specific to provide, inter alia, that the issuance of notice under Section 148 of the
Act shall be through automated location and in a faceless manner. Therefore, the Scheme is
mandatory and provides the specification as to how the notice has to be issued. Further the
argument of the Revenue that Section 151A of the Act takes into account that the procedure may be
modified under the Act is without appreciating that if the procedure is required to be modified then
the same would require modification of the notified Scheme. It is not open to the Revenue to refuse
to follow the Scheme as the Scheme is clearly mandatory and is required to be followed by all
Assessing Officers.
(viii) The argument of the Revenue in paragraph 5.1 of the Office Memorandum that the Section and

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025

remaining confined to the principles laid down in the said Section and Scheme, is without
appreciating that one of the main principles laid down in the Scheme is that the notice under
Section 148 of the Act is required to be issued through automated allocation and in a faceless
manner. There is no leeway given on the said aspect and, therefore, there is no question of the
administration to device and modify procedures with respect to the issuance of notice.
39. With reference to the decision of the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Triton Overseas Private
Limited (Supra), the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court has passed the order without considering the
Scheme dated 29th March 2022 as the
- 55 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
said Scheme is not referred to in the order. Therefore, the said judgment cannot be treated as a
precedent or relied upon to decide the jurisdiction of the Assessing Officer to issue notice under
Section 148 of the Act. The Hon'ble Calcutta High Court has referred to an Office Memorandum
dated 20th February 2023 being F No.370153/7/2023 TPL which has been dealt with above.
Therefore, no reliance can be placed on the said Office Memorandum to justify that the JAO has
jurisdiction to issue notice under Section 148 of the Act. Further the Hon'ble Telangana High Court
in the case of Kankanala Ravindra Reddy vs. Income Tax Officer [(2023) 156 taxmann.com 178
(Telangana)/295 Taxman 652 (Telangana)] has held that in view of the provisions of Section 151A of
the Act 14 read with the Scheme dated 29th March 2022 the notices issued by the JAOs are invalid
and bad in law. We are also of the same view. "
(Emphasis supplied) The High Court of Bombay in PARAS MAHENDRA SHAH v.
UNION OF INDIA5 has held as follows:
"5. Therefore, it is apparent that the Respondent- Revenue is not in compliance with
the Scheme notified by the Central Government pursuant to Section 151A(2) of the
Act. The Scheme has also been tabled in Parliament and is in the character of
subordinate legislation, which governs the conduct of proceedings under Section
148A as well as Section 148 of the Act. In view of the explicit declaration of the law in
Hexaware, the grievance of the Petitioner-Assessee insofar as it relates to an invalid
issuance of a notice is sustainable and consequently, the very manner in which the
proceedings have been initiated, vitiates the proceedings.

7. In the light of the above discussion, and as there is no dispute that the JAO had no jurisdiction to
issue the impugned notice, the Writ Petition is accordingly allowed and the impugned notice as well
as order are hereby quashed and set aside.
8. We make it clear that having disposed of this petition on the ground of non-compliance with
Section 151A of the Act, we have not expressed any opinion on the other issues raised in the Writ

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
10. On a plain reading of paragraph 3, it is clear to us that the provisions of section 148A would also
fall within the ambit/scope of the scheme. All aspects pertaining to "assessment","reassessment" or
"recomputation" under section 147 of the Act and issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act, are
to be undertaken through automated allocation, in accordance with risk management strategy
formulated by the Board, as provided for in section 148 of the Act for issuance of notice, and in a
faceless manner, to the extent provided under section 144B of the Act, in making assessment or
reassessment of total income or loss of assessee.
11. Having noted the scope of the scheme under the aforesaid notification, the basic provision under
which such notification is issued, namely, section 151A would also be required to be noted, which
reads thus:
"151A. Faceless assessment of income escaping assessment.--
(1) The Central Government may make a scheme, by notification in the Official
Gazette, for the purposes of assessment, reassessment or re-computation under
section 147 or issuance of notice under section 148 or conducting of enquiries or

to the extent technologically feasible;
(b) optimising utilisation of the resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation;
(c) introducing a team-based assessment, reassessment, recomputation or issuance or sanction of

(2) The Central Government may, for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under
sub-section (1), by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that any of the provisions of this Act
shall not apply or shall apply with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations as may be
specified in the notification:
Provided that no direction shall be issued after the 31st day of March, 2022.
(3) Every notification issued under sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) shall, as soon
as may be after the notification is issued, be laid before each House of Parliament."

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
12. On a plain reading of sub-section (1) of section 151A, it is seen that it clearly provides that the
Central Government may make a scheme by notification in the Official Gazette for the purposes of
assessment, reassessment or recomputation under section 147 or issuance of notice under section
148 or conducting of enquiries, etc., or sanction for issue of such notice under section 151, so as to
impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability which could be in terms of clauses
(a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of section 151A, namely, eliminating the interface between the
Income-tax authority and the assessee or any other person, to the extent technologically feasible;
optimising utilisation of resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation; and
introducing a team-based assessment,
- 59 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
reassessment, recomputation or issuance or sanction of notice with dynamic jurisdiction. Sub-
section (2) makes it explicit that for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under
sub-section (1), by notification in the Official Gazette, the Central Government can also direct that
any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall apply with such exceptions, modifications
and adaptations as may be specified in the notification and further under sub-section (3), every
notification issued under sub-section (1) and sub- section (2) shall be laid before each House of
Parliament.
13. It is thus clear from the implications as brought about by the provisions of section 151A that the
notification dated March 29, 2022 ((2022) 442 ITR (Stat) 198) is issued in terms of what has been
provided under section 151A. It has been issued after the amendments were incorporated in sub-
section (1) by Finance Act, 2021 ((2021) 432 ITR (Stat) 52) with effect from April 1, 2022. It would
be thus difficult to accept a proposition when in paragraph 3(a) of the scheme defining the scope of
the scheme when the words "assessment","reassessment" or "recomputation" under section 147 of
the Act are explicitly provided, and further when clause (b) in paragraph 3 of the scheme provides
for issuance of notice under section 148 of the Act, it would not take within its ambit the provisions
of section 148A which are the initial steps, which in a given case are required to be taken in issuance
of notice under section 148 of the Act. Section 148A provides for "Conducting inquiry, providing
opportunity before issue of notice under section 148".Thus, this provision postulates a procedure
inextricably linked to section 148 which would apply to all cases of reassessment with a proviso
stipulating exceptions to the rule. In other words, section 148A in its object, intent and purpose is
inextricably connected with the assessment, reassessment or recomputation, for which a notice
under section 148 may be issued. Any other view would mean that the requirement to adopt the
faceless procedure under the scheme is a

HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
mere ministerial requirement for issuance of the notice. Such a reading would not be in conformity
with the objectives spelt out in clauses (a), (b) and
(c) of section 151A(1).
14. Thus, to accept a contention that merely because the notification does not explicitly refer to the
provisions of section 148A, the scope of the scheme as defined in paragraph 3 would exclude the
applicability of section 148A, would lead to an absolute absurdity, and more particularly,
considering the express provisions of sub-section (1) of section 151A. Also it is not possible to accept
reading of the provisions of section 144B dehors section 151A(1). Sub-section (2) of section 151A is
specifically incorporated to empower the Central Government to exclude the applicability of any of
the provisions of the Act and/or to make such provisions applicable with exceptions, modifications
and adaptations. Nothing of this nature is found in the notification to infer any exclusion of section
148A, and when it clearly concerns the entire assessment, reassessment or recomputation under
section 147 and issuance of notice in that regard under section 148 of the Act.
15. Thus, the Central Government has not applied the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 151A to
specifically exclude the application of section 148A from the scope of the scheme in paragraph 3 of
the notification dated March 29, 2022 ((2022) 442 ITR (Stat) 198), it would hence not be possible to
accept the Revenue's contention that the provisions of section 148A stands excluded from the
applicability of the faceless mechanism.
16. For the aforesaid reasons, we would not accept Mr. Mohanty's submission that the scope of the
scheme would exclude the applicability of section 148A and if steps are taken by the jurisdictional
Assessing Officer under section 148A culminating into issuance of a notice under section 148 of the
Act, the entire exercise being undertaken outside the faceless mechanism would be required to be
quashed and set aside. There cannot be any other

reading of these provisions along with the
notification.
17. In the light of the above discussion, and as there is no dispute that the jurisdictional Assessing
Officer had no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notice, the writ petition is accordingly allowed in
terms of prayer clause (a) which reads thus:
"(a) that this hon'ble court be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari or any other writ,
order or direction under article 226 of the Constitution of India calling for the
records of the case leading to the issue of the impugned initial notice (exhibit L)
dated March 30, 2024, passing of the impugned order (exhibit P) dated April 25,

going through the same and examining the question of legality thereof quash, cancel

impugned order (exhibit P) dated April 25, 2024 and the impugned notice (exhibit Q)
dated April 25, 2024;"
(Emphasis supplied) Therefore, the division benches of the High Courts as afore-
quoted in one voice held that any notice issued outside faceless regime would be contrary to law and
without jurisdiction.

"I) Scope of Assessment:
5.3.1. The High Courts of Delhi and Madras appear on proceed on the premise that
re-
assessment would commence only on issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act and
proceedings under Section 148A is atleast a step removed from commencement of proceedings
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 48
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
relating to re- assessment. This, I would think involves dissection of proceeding relating to
assessment of escaped income/ reassessment into two parts. The first part relating to assessment
being until orders are passed under Section 148A and corresponding issuance of notice under
Section 148 of the Act. The second part being post issuance of notice under Section 148 of the Act,
commencing with issuance of notice under Section 143(2) or Section 142(1) of the Act. While, the
first part is to be carried out/performed by JAO, second part of assessment must be by FAO. This
dissection appears to be artificial.
5.3.2. The above view also appears to be in conflict with the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court wherein assessment has been held to be comprehensive and would encompass the entire
gamut of proceedings starting with filing of returns or issue of notice and ending with the
determination of tax payable by assessee. Importantly, in Auto and metal Engineers case, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court had also rejected the contention suggesting splitting/ dissecting the
assessment into various stages, the relevant portions of the judgment are extracted hereunder:
(i) S. Sankarappa v. Income Tax Officer, reported in 1967 SCC OnLine SC 25:
"3. ..... The word assessment is used in a comprehensive sense and includes all
proceedings, starting with the filing of the return or issue of notice and ending with
the determination of the tax payable by assessee."

HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
(ii) J.K. Iron & Steel Co. v. L.T. Officer, reported in 1965 SCC OnLine ALL 423:
"9. ..... The word 'assessment' includes not only computation of income but also the
entire machinery and procedure for imposing and enforcing the tax liability."
(iii) Auto & Metal Engineers v. Union of India, reported in (1997) 7 SCC 734:
"7. ..... the expression "assessment proceeding" in the explanation must be construed
to comprehend the entire process of assessment starting from the stage of filing of
the return under Section 139 or issuance of notice under Section 142(1) till the
making of the order of assessment under Section 143(3) or Section 144. Since the
making of the order of assessment under Section 143(3) or Section 144 of the Act is
an integral part of the assessment proceeding, it is not possible to split the
assessment proceeding and confine it up to the stage of inquiry under Sections 142
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 49
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
and 143 and exclude the making of the order of assessment from its ambit."
5.3.3. It thus appears that proceedings for reassessment would commence with initiation of
proceedings under Section 148A of the Act inasmuch as the notice is preceded by an enquiry with
respect to information, which suggests that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. In
other words, proceedings under Section 148 A of the Act itself could be invoked only when there is
information which suggests that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment. It is thus an
integral part of re-assessment/ assessment of escaped income and any attempt to treat it as distinct
or removed from re-assessment would only result in distorting the scheme relating to reassessment/
assessment of escaped income. This would be clear if we bear in mind that Section 148A of the Act,
was inserted with a view to legislatively incorporate the procedure laid down in GKN Driveshafts.
The dissection of reassessment proceedings into two parts appear to be in conflict

with the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on assessment being comprehensive and
expansive to take within its fold all proceedings relating thereto referred supra.
5.3.4. It may also be relevant to note that Apex Court in the case of Union of India v. Ashish Agarwal
reported in (2023) 1 SCC 617, while dealing with validity of reassessment notices issued post
01.04.2021 under the erst while provisions governing re-assessment viz., Sections 148 to Section 151
of the Act and not in terms of the amended Sections 147 to 149 and Section 151 of the Act which
would govern re-assessment with effect from 01.04.2021, observed as under:
"10. Parliament introduced reformative changes to Sections 147 to 151 of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 governing reassessment proceedings by way of the Finance Act, 2021,
which was passed on 28-3-2021. The substituted Sections 147 to 149 and Section 151
applicable w.e.f. 1-4-2021 .....
11. In sub-section (1) of Section 151-A of the Income Tax Act, in the opening portion,
after the words and figures "issuance of notice under Section 148", the words, figures
and letter "or conducting of enquiries or issuance of show-cause notice or passing of
order under Section 148-A" are inserted.
12. Despite the substituted Sections 147 to 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 by the
Finance Act, 2021 coming into force on 1-4-2021, according to learned ASG, the
Revenue issued approximately 90,000 reassessment notices to the respective

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
assessees under the erstwhile Sections 148 to 151 thereof by relying on explanations
in the Notifications dated 31-3-2021 and 27-4-2021. The said reassessment notices
were the subject-matter of writ petitions before the various High Courts. The
respective High Courts have held that all the respective reassessment notices issued
under the erstwhile Sections 148 to 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, are bad in law as
the reassessment notices issued after 1-4- 2021 are governed by the substituted
Sections 147 to 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, substituted by the Finance Act, 2021.
Consequently, the respective High Courts have set aside all the reassessment notices

issued under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 wherever assailed.
13. The common judgment and order [Ashok Kumar Agarwal v.Union of India, 2021
SCC OnLine All 799] passed by the High Court of Allahabad is the subject- matter of
the present appeals. However, the High Court of Delhi in its common judgment and
order dated 15-12- 2021 [Mon Mohan Kohli v. CIT, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 5250] while
quashing the respective reassessment notices has also observed that if the law
permits the Revenue to take further steps in the matter they shall be at liberty to do
so.
14. We have heard Shri N. Venkataraman, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the
Revenue and Shri C.A. Sundaram and Shri S. Ganesh, learned Senior Advocates and
other learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective assessee.
15. It cannot be disputed that by substitution of Sections 147 to 151 of the Income Tax
Act ("the IT Act") by the Finance Act, 2021, radical and reformative changes are made
governing the procedure for reassessment proceedings. Amended Sections 147 to 149
and Section 151 of the IT Act prescribe the procedure governing initiation of
reassessment proceedings. However, for several reasons, the same gave rise to
numerous litigations and the reopening were challenged inter alia, on the grounds
such as:
(1) no valid "reason to believe".
(2) no tangible/reliable material/information in possession of the assessing officer leading to
formation of belief that income has escaped assessment, (3) no enquiry being conducted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 51
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
assessing officer prior to the issuance of notice; and reopening is based on change of opinion of the
assessing officer and (4) lastly the mandatory procedure laid down by this Court in GKN Driveshafts
(India) Ltd. v. ITO [GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO, (2003) 1 SCC 72] , has not been followed.
.....
17. Under the substituted provisions of the IT Act vide the Finance Act, 2021, no notice under
Section 148 of the IT Act can be issued without following the procedure prescribed under Section
148-A of the IT Act.
- 66 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
Along with the notice under Section 148 of the IT Act, the assessing officer ("AO") is required to
serve the order passed under Section 148-A of the IT Act. Section 148-A of the IT Act is a new
provision which is in the nature of a condition precedent. Introduction of Section 148-A of the IT Act
can thus be said to be a game changer with an aim to achieve the ultimate object of simplifying the
tax administration, ease compliance and reduce litigation.
18. But prior to pre-Finance Act, 2021, while reopening an assessment, the procedure of giving the
reasons for reopening and an opportunity to the assessee and the decision of the objectives were
required to be followed as per the judgment of this Court in GKN Driveshafts (India) [GKN
Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO, (2003) 1 SCC 72] .
19. However, by way of Section 148-A, the procedure has now been streamlined and simplified. It
provides that before issuing any notice under Section 148, the assessing officer shall:
(i) conduct any enquiry, if required, with the approval of specified authority, with
respect to the information which suggests that the income chargeable to tax has
escaped assessment;
(ii) provide an opportunity of being heard to the assessee, with the prior approval of
specified authority;
(iii) consider the reply of the assessee furnished, if any, in response to the show-cause
notice referred to in clause
(b); and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 52
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
(iv) decide, on the basis of material available on record including reply of the
assessee, as to whether or not it is a fit case to issue a notice under Section 148 of the
IT Act; and
(v) the AO is required to pass a specific order within the time stipulated.
.....
24. There appears to be genuine non-application of the amendments as the officers of the Revenue
may have been under a bona fide belief that the amendments may not yet have been
enforced.Therefore, we are of the opinion that some leeway must be shown in that regard which the
High Courts could have done so. Therefore, instead of quashing and setting aside the reassessment
notices issued under the unamended provision of the IT Act, the High Courts ought to have passed
an order construing the notices issued under the unamended Act/unamended provision of
- 67 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
the IT Act as those deemed to have been issued under Section 148-A of the IT Act as per the new
provision Section 148-A and the Revenue ought to have been permitted to proceed further with the
reassessment proceedings as per the substituted provisions of Sections 147 to 151 of the IT Act as per
the Finance Act, 2021, subject to compliance of all the procedural requirements and the defences,
which may be available to the assessee under the substituted provisions of Sections 147 to 151 of the
IT Act and which may be available under the Finance Act, 2021 and in law.
.....
25.1. The respective impugned Section 148 notices issued to the respective assessees shall be
deemed to have been issued under Section 148-A of the IT Act as substituted by the Finance Act,
2021 and treated to be show-cause notices in terms of Section 148-A(b). The respective assessing
officers shall within thirty days from today provide to the assessees the information and material
relied upon by the Revenue so that the assessees can reply to the notices within two weeks
thereafter.
25.2. The requirement of conducting any enquiry with the prior approval of the specified authority
under Section 148-A(a) be dispensed with as a one-time measure vis-à-vis those notices which have
been issued under Section 148 of the unamended Act from 1-4-2021 till date, including those which
have been quashed by the High Courts."

(emphasis supplied) 5.3.5. The above observations would suggest the following:
a) Proceedings under Section 148A of the Act is an integral part of re- assessment.
b) Proceedings under Section 148 A of the Act is a condition precedent and thus to
say that re-
assessment would commence only after issuance of a notice under Section 142(1) or Section 143(2)
of the Act, after completion of proceedings under Section 148A of the Act, results in bringing about
an
- 68 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
artificial dissection of an integrated re-assessment proceeding.
c) It cannot be disputed that the changes to Sections 147 to 151 of the Act, introduced vide Finance
Act, 2021, are made governing the procedure relating to reassessment. In other words, Section 148A
of the Act is also part of the procedure governing reassessment.
d) If Section 148A of the Act is distinct from re-assessment/ assessment of escaped income, the need
to deem notice issued under Section 148 of the Act, post introduction of Section 148 A of the Act as
one under Section 148A of the Act, would not have arisen. The deeming was necessary, else
reassessment would be rendered vulnerable to challenge on the ground of want of jurisdiction.
5.3.6. In view of the above, I am unable to concur with the decision of this Court dissecting the
integrated reassessment proceeding into two parts.
II) Scheme not in confirmity with Parent Act:
5.3.7. Considering the legislative and judicial history leading up to insertion of
Section 148A and Section 151A of the Act, it appears that omission of Section 148A in
the Scheme framed by the Central Government in exercise of powers under Section
151A is an omission by the delegate and may well constrict the scope and policy
behind Section 151A of the Act. Thus, the scheme may have to be understood as also
covering the procedure contemplated under Section 148A of the Act. While this Court
is conscious that a matter which should have been, but has not been provided for in a
statute cannot be supplied by Courts, as to do so will be legislation and not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 54
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
costruction. However, the same is not without exception and the following
observations of Denning, L.J. cited with approval by the Supreme Court would make
it clear:
"When a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the
draftsman. He must set to
- 69 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament and then he must
supplement the written words so as to give 'force and life' to the intention of the
Legislature. A judge should ask himself the question how, if the makers of the Act had
themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, they would have straightened it
out? He must then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter the material of
which the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out the creases."
5.3.8. Yet another reason why I am inclined to depart from the restraint which Courts are normally
required to exercise while examining a case of omission by legislature or its delegate, is in view of
the fact that Section 151A of the Income Tax Act (Parent Act) provides and contemplates a scheme
being framed for assessment, re-assessment, re computation under Section 147, 148A and 148 of the
Act.
5.3.9. It is trite law that legislature shall enunciate the policy before entrusting the power to make
subordinate/subsidiary legislation to another body of its choice. The delegate must necessarily work
within the scope of its authority and cannot widen or constrict the scope of the Act or the policy laid
down thereunder. The relevant portion is extracted hereunder:
(i) Agricultural Market Committee v. Shalimar Chemical Works Ltd., reported in
(1997) 5 SCC 516:
"26. The principle which, therefore, emerges out is that the essential legislative
function consists of the determination of the legislative policy and the legislature
cannot abdicate essential legislative function in favour of another. Power to make
subsidiary legislation may be entrusted by the legislature to another body of its choice
but the legislature should, before delegating, enunciate either expressly or by
implication, the policy and the principles for the guidance of the delegates. These
principles also apply to taxing statutes. The effect of these principles is that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 55
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
delegate which has been authorised to make subsidiary rules and regulations has to
work within the scope of its authority and cannot widen or constrict the
- 70 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
scope of the Act or the policy laid down thereunder. It cannot, in the garb of making
rules, legislate on the field covered by the Act and has to restrict itself to the mode of
implementation of the policy and purpose of the Act."
(ii) Gaurav Kumar v. Union of India, reported in (2025) 1 SCC 641:
"67. A two-Judge Bench of this Court identified the following relevant principles in
matters of delegated legislation : (Shalimar Chemical Works case [Agricultural
Market Committee v. Shalimar Chemical Works Ltd., (1997) 5 SCC 516] , SCC p. 525,
para 26) "26. ... the delegate which has been authorised to make subsidiary rules and
regulations has to work within the scope of its authority and cannot widen or
constrict the scope of the Act or the policy laid down thereunder.
It cannot, in the garb of making rules, legislate on the field covered by the Act and has to restrict
itself to the mode of implementation of the policy and purpose of the Act."
Given the above principle, it was observed that Section 12 is a fiscal provision and had to be
construed strictly. It was further observed that any circumstance, situation, factor, or condition
which was not contemplated by the Act could not be taken into consideration to raise the
presumption regarding sale or purchase of the notified agricultural produce. It was held that the
bye-law introduced additional factors such as "weighed", "measured", and "counted" which were not
contemplated under Section 12. Therefore, the bye-laws were held to be ultra vires for widening the
scope of the presumption under Section 12.
.....
72.2. A delegate cannot widen or constrict the scope of the parent legislation or the legislative policy
prescribed under it; and ......"
5.3.10. Section 151A being an Act of parliament reflects the legislative policy. Importantly, Section
151A of the Act expressly includes within the scope of faceless assessment, conducting of enquiries,
issuance of notice, passing order under Section 148A and issuance of notice

under Section 148 of the Act. Section 151A confers power on the Central Government to make a
scheme by notification in the official gazettee for the purpose of effectuating the above legislative
policy. The Central Government has in exercise of its powers conferred under Section 151A of the
Act framed a scheme wherein Section 148A of the Act, has been omitted while including other
provisions mentioned in Section 151A of the Act including Section 148 of the Act, which is
consequential to a proceeding under Section 148A of the Act. It appears doubtful if it is even open to
the Central Government to frame a scheme leaving out one of the elements enumerated in the
parent Act viz., Section 148A of the Act, while exercising its powers conferred under Section 151A of
the Act, more so when the enabling provision i.e., Section 151 A of the Act expressly includes Section
148A of the Act. It appears unless Section 148 A of the Act is read into the scheme framed under
Section 151A of the Act, it would result in constricting the scope of Section 151A of the Act, which is a
plenary legislation, by a delegated legislation i.e., scheme, which is impermissible. It thus appears to
me that any attempt to suggest that Section 148A of the Act is outside the Scheme framed by the
Central Government in exercise of its power conferred under Section 151A of the Act, would be
overlooking the legislative policy enunciated in Section 151A of the Act. It may result in giving
primacy to the scheme which is a subordinate legislation over Section 151A of the Act, which as
stated above is the parent Act enabling the Central Government to frame a scheme. A consequence/
construction which ought to be avoided."

Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
"This petition got listed in view of a difference of opinion between two learned Single
Judges.
2. Learned Single Judge in order dated 20.12.2024 in WP Nos.25223 of 2024 held
that it does not matter if the Jurisdictional Assessing Officer (JAO) issues the notice
and it is not mandatory that it should be issued by the Faceless Assessment Officer
(FAO). Another learned Single Judge in order dated 21.04.2025 in WP No.22402 of
2024 and batch cases, followed what was held by the Bombay High Court in
Hexaware Technologies Ltd vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax; and opined
that it was mandatory for the FAO to issue notice and issuance of notice by JAO
would make the notice invalid.
3. Learned Single Judge thereafter directed the matter to be placed before the Chief
Justice for constituting a Division Bench to consider the divergent views. It is,
therefore, this matter was listed before us today.
4. Learned Senior Counsel, Mr.Jayakumar, submits that the law as laid in BMC
Software India (P) Ltd vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax will apply. This
judgment followed Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra) and Kairos Properties (P) Ltd
vs. Assistant CIT.
5. Mr.Srinivas states that Special Leave Petitions are pending against the judgment in
BMC Software India (P) Ltd (supra), Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra) as also
Kairos Properties (P) Ltd (supra) and that the petitions are expected to be taken up
after the Supreme Court reopens.
6. We follow the law as laid down in Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra), the said
judgment was W.P.No.35385 of 2024 decided on 24-06-2025

7. Admittedly, Mr.Srinivas, in fairness, states that there is no stay. Therefore, the law as laid down
by Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra) applies.
8. It is clarified that if the Apex Court reverses the judgment of Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra),
parties will be governed by the decision of the Apex Court.
9. Keeping open all rights and contentions of parties, including liberty to apply to this Court, in case
the Revenue succeeds before the Apex Court, for revival of this petition, the notice issued in this
petition is quashed and set aside.

10. In this petition, apart from the issue of notice issued by JAO instead of FAO, all or many of the
issues which were considered in Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra) are involved.
11. To the extent the issues raised in Hexaware Technologies Ltd (supra) are not covered, those are
kept open to be raised at the appropriate stage.
12. With the liberty as noted above, this petition stand disposed of holding in favour of assessee.
There will be no order as to costs. Consequently, the interim applications also stand disposed of."

Noticing that the proceedings therein are quashed with a clarification that in the event, the Apex
Court reverses the judgment against the HEXAWARE TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, the parties
would be covered by the decision of the Apex Court.
Keeping open all the contentions, the notice challenged was set aside. The High Court of Telangana
in the case of KANAKANALA RAVINDRA REDDY (supra) has held in favour of the assessee,
holding that once faceless regime is in place, the jurisdictional Assessing Officer could not have
acted outside the notification by issuing a notice invoking his jurisdiction. A subsequent judgment
rendered by the division bench of the High Court of Telangana in the case of SOUTHERN POWER
DISTRIBUTION COMPANY OF TELANGANA LIMITED v.

either challenged to the notices which were issued under Section 148A and 148 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 (for short 'the Act') or the assessment orders those have been passed under Section 147 of
the Act which have been assailed.
3. This writ petition is being taken up today only on one of the grounds, that the notices issued
under Section 148A of the Act and the subsequent initiation of proceedings under Section 148 of the
Act by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer, whereas in terms of the amendment that was brought to
the Income Tax Act by way of Finance Act, 2021 w.e.f., 01.04.2021 onwards, proceedings under
Section 148A of the Act as also under Section 148 of the Act ought to have also been issued and
proceeded in a faceless manner.
4. The contention of the petitioner is that the issue of proceedings being in violation of the Finance

confronted with large filing of identical matters on daily basis ranging between 5 to 10 writ petitions.

ground that the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Hexaware Technologies Ltd., (2

addition, there are about 1200 SLPs also filed arising out of the same issue being decided by various

the Income Tax Department to take appropriate steps to either hold back issuance of notice under
Section 148A and under Section 148 of the Act by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer, rather the
authorities concerned in the teeth of series of decisions by all the major High Courts in India are

9. Upon a query being put as to why can't this writ petition be disposed of in the teeth of the decision
rendered by this Court in the case of Kanakala Ravindra Reddy (1 supra), learned Standing Counsel
for the Income Tax Department contends that those would unnecessarily burden the Income Tax
Department where they would be required to file equal number of SLPs before the Hon'ble Supreme
Court and it would be further burdening the exchequer of the Union of India. It was also the
contention of the learned Standing Counsel that no prejudice would be caused to the interest of the
petitioners in case if this writ petition is kept pending till the finalization of the SLPs pending before
the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the fact that the petitioner is already enjoying the benefit of interim
protection. Nonetheless, on the earlier query of this Court as to why the Income Tax Department
have not come out with a mechanism to issue appropriate instructions or to take appropriate steps
in ensuring that proceedings under Section 148A of the Act as also the assessment orders under
Section 148 of the Act are kept in a hold in the light of the decisions dedcided by the various High
Courts, it was submitted by the learned Standing Counsel that the said steps can only be taken at the
level of CBDT as any such steps would

have to be taken Pan India and cannot be limited to any of these jurisdictional High Courts.
10. As a result of which, what we are facing is steep increase of litigation day in and day out even
though various orders have been passed by this High Court allowing writ petitions on the very same
issue. The Income Tax authorities concerned are still even now in 2025 also initiating proceedings
in contravention to the provisions of Section 151A of the Act and as a result by now, more than 600
to 700 petitions have been already got piled up before this High Court on an issue which otherwise
stands squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in the case of Kanakala Ravindra Reddy (1
supra). What is also surprising is the fact that though while allowing the writ petitions in the case of
Kanakala Ravindra Reddy (1 supra), the Division Bench while reserving the right of the Revenue,
has also protected the interest of the petitioners insofar as the liberty which was granted to the
Revenue for initiating fresh proceedings strictly in accordance with the amended provisions of the
Act, as amended by the Finance Act, 2020 and the Finance Act, 2021. The petitioner assessee would
be entitled to challenge or raise the other legal objections if the Revenue initiates fresh proceedings.
The Department has made no endeavour in availing the said liberty that was reserved for the
Revenue. On the contrary, they have been still sticking on to the stand, which this High Court as well
as many other High Courts already held to be bad.

11. It appears that because of the aforesaid liberty that this High Court had granted permitting the
Revenue for initiating fresh proceedings as a one-time measure in a faceless manner, the Income
Tax Department wants to take advantage of the same by protracting these proceedings which would
enable them to meet the limitation that would otherwise come in the way. Likewise, if the writ
petition is kept pending for a considerable long period of time and finally at a later stage if the
Hon'ble Supreme Court confirms the decision taken by this High Court as also by the other High
Courts in which the SLPs are still pending, the Income Tax Department would get the advantage of
the liberty that is otherwise protected in favour of the Revenue for initiation of fresh proceedings
from the disposal of these matters at
- 79 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
a much later stage which would be advantageous and beneficial to the Revenue and would be equally
disadvantageous and detrimental so far as interest of the assesses are concerned. As a consequence,
the Income Tax Department gets an extended period of time for initiation of fresh proceedings.
12. The alarming trend of docket explosion in this Court, despite the clear precedent set in Kanakala
Ravindra Reddy (1 supra), is a matter of grave concern. The Income Tax Department's persistent
initiation of fresh proceedings, disregarding the established judicial pronouncements, has led to an
unprecedented surge in litigation with over 600-700 petitions piling up on the same issue. This
deliberate approach not only undermines the principle of judicial precedent but also strains the
judicial resources unnecessarily. The Department's strategy of awaiting the Supreme Court's
decision on pending SLPs while continuing to initiate fresh proceedings appears to be a calculated
move to buy time and circumvent limitation periods, rather than adhering to the established legal
position. Such conduct raises serious questions about the administrative efficiency and the respect
for judicial pronouncements, particularly when this Court has already provided a balanced approach
by preserving both the Revenue's rights and assesses interests.
13. Another aspect which needs to be considered is that in fact it should have been realized by the
Income Tax Department itself and should have found out via media in ensuring that proceedings
under Sections 148-A and 148 should not have been issued in a faceless manner, at least till the
Hon'ble Supreme Court decide the twelve hundred (1200) odd SLPs which it is already seized of or,
at least the Income Tax Department should have found out some remedial steps to ensure that
wherever the authorities intend to initiate proceedings under Sections 148-A and 148, other than in
a faceless manner, the proceedings should have been deferred without precipitating the matter
further intimating the assessee that they shall initiate appropriate proceedings only after the SLP's
are decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the very same issue. This

again, the Income Tax Department, has not been able to give a convincing reply, except for the fact
that such a decision if at all has to be taken, has to be taken for the whole of India, and which
otherwise has to be by way of a policy decision and that too at the level of Central Board of Direct
Taxes. Though the learned Standing Counsel for the Income Tax Department contended that the
Delhi High Court dismissed a writ petition of similar nature, on the one hand when the High Court
is struggling to reduce its pendency, such notices which are under challenge in this writ petition are
forcing the assessee to knock the doors of this High Court resulting in filing of hundreds of new writ
petitions which in the long run not only affects the disposal of the writ petitions but also consumes
substantial time of the Bench in hearing these matters again and again on daily basis. Admittedly, in
spite of the matter before the Hon'ble Supreme Court having been taken on many occasions, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court which is seized of the matter has been reluctant in granting any interim
protection to the Income Tax Department. Yet, the authorities concerned at the State level are not
ready to accept the verdict passed by a majority of High Courts of different States on the same issue;
and to make things further worse, the Income Tax Department is showing audacity by issuing
notices continuously under Sections 148-A and 148 through the jurisdictional Assessing Officer
whereas it ought to have been only in the faceless manner.
14. In the case of BANK OF INDIA vs. ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER, INCOME TAX [2025] 170
taxmann.com 422 (Bombay), on an issue whether it was justifiable on the part of the Income Tax
Department in not following an order passed by the adjudicating authority only on the ground that
the appeals are pending, the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay held at paragraph No.25
as under, viz., :

(Bombay) as also the recent decision of the co- ordinate Bench of this Court in Samp
Furniture (P) Ltd. v. ITO [2024] 165 taxmann.com 581/300 Taxman 452 (Bombay)
of which one of us (Justice G.S. Kulkarni) was a member, wherein the Court
categorically observed that the Revenue having not "accepted"
the judgment of the High Court would not mean that till the same is set aside in a manner known to
law, it would loose its binding force. Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in Union of
India vs. Kamlakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. [1992] taxmann.com 16/55 ELT 433 (SC) , the Court
observed that the approach of the officials of Revenue of treating decisions being "not acceptable"
was criticized by the Supreme Court. In such decision, following are the relevant observations made
by the Supreme Court.
"6. Sri Reddy is perhaps right in saying that the officers were not actuated by any
mala fides in passing the impugned orders. They perhaps genuinely felt that the claim
of the assessee was not tenable and that, if it was accepted, the Revenue would suffer.
But what Sri Reddy overlooks is that we are not concerned here with the correctness
or otherwise of their conclusion or of any factual malafides but with the fact that the
officers, in reaching in their conclusion, by-passed two appellate orders in regard to
the same issue which were placed before them, one of the Collector (Appeals) and the
other of the Tribunal. The High Court has, in our view, rightly criticized this conduct
of the Assistant Collectors and the harassment to the assessee caused by the failure of
these officers to give effect to the orders of authorities higher to them in the appellate
hierarchy. It cannot be too vehemently emphasized that it is of utmost importance
that, in disposing of the quasijudicial issues before them, revenue officers are bound
by the decisions of the appellate authorities. The order of the Appellte Collector is
binding on the Assistant Collectors working within his jurisdiction and the order of
the Tribunal is binding upon the Assistant Collectors and the Appellate Collectors
who function under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The principles of judicial
discipline
- 82 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
require that the orders of the higher appellate authorities should be followed
unreservedly by the subordinate authorities. The mere fact that the order of the
appellate authority is not "acceptable" to the department - in itself an objectionable
phrase - and is the subject matter of an appeal can furnish no ground for not
following it unless its operation has been suspended by a competent court. If this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 65
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
healthy rule is not followed, the result will only be undue harassment to assesses and
chaos in administration of tax laws.
.........
12. We have dealt with this aspect at some length, because it has been suggested by
the learned Additional Solicitor General that the observations made by the High
Court, have been harsh on the officers. It is clear that the observations of the High
Court, seemingly vehement, and apparently unpalatable to the Revenue, are only
intended to curb a tendency in revenue matters which, if allowed to become
widespread, could result in considerable harassment to the assesses-public without
any benefit to the Revenue. We would like to say that the department should take
these observations in the proper spirit. The observations of the High Court should be
kept in mind in future and the utmost regard should be paid by the adjudicating
authorities and the appellate authorities to the requirements of judicial discipline and
the need for giving effect to the orders of the higher appellate authorities which are
binding on them."
15. What is worrying this Bench more is the fact that an endeavour is being made whole heartedly to
ensure not to generate further litigation on issues which have been laid to rest by a large number of
High Courts all of whom have taken a consistent stand that the action of the Income Tax
Department being violative of the Finance Act, 2020 and Finance Act, 2021. Now, in order to protect
the interest of the Revenue as also that of the assessee, it would be trite at this juncture, if we
dispose of the writ

petition with an observation/direction that the disposal of the instant writ petition in terms of the
judgment rendered by this High Court in the case of Kankanala Ravindra Reddy (1 supra) shall
however be subject to the outcome of the SLPs which were filed by the Income Tax Department and
which is pending consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
16. In the given facts and circumstances, this Bench is of the considered opinion that unless and
until we do not timely dispose of matters which are squarely covered by the decision of this Court
and which stands fortified by the decisions of the various other High Courts on the very same issue,
the pendency of this High Court would further be burdened which otherwise can be decided and
disposed of as a covered matter.

17. So far as the interest of the Revenue is concerned, we are of the considered opinion that the
interest of the Revenue has already been considered and protected, as has been observed in
paragraphs 36, 37 and 38 of the order which, for ready reference, is reproduced hereunder:
"36. For all the aforesaid reasons, the impugned notices issued and the proceedings
drawn by the respondent Department is neither tenable, nor sustainable. The notices
so issued and the procedure adopted being per se illegal, deserves to be and are
accordingly set aside/quashed. As a consequence, all the impugned orders getting
quashed, the consequential orders passed by the respondent-Department pursuant to
the notices issued under Section 147 and 148 would also get quashed and it is ordered
accordingly. The reason we are quashing the consequential order is on the principles
that when the initiation of the proceedings itself was procedurally wrong, the
subsequent orders also gets nullified automatically.
37. The preliminary objection raised by the petitioner is sustained and all these writ
petitions stands allowed on this very jurisdictional issue. Since the impugned notices
and orders are getting quashed on the point of
- 84 -
NC: 2025:KHC:33738
HC-KAR AND 1 OTHER
jurisdiction, we are not inclined to proceed further and decide the other issues raised
by the petitioner which stands reserved to be raised and contended in an appropriate
proceedings.
38. Since the Hon'ble Supreme Court had, in the case of Ashish Agarwal, supra, as a
one-time measure exercising the powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of
India, permitted the Revenue to proceed under the substituted provisions, and this
Court allowing the petitions only on the procedural flaw, the right conferred on the
Revenue would remain reserved to proceed further if they so want from the stage of
the order of the Supreme Court in the case of Ashish Agarwal, supra."
18. We would only further like to make observations that since we are inclined to dispose of the
instant writ petition, conscious of the fact that the earlier order of this High Court in the case of
Kanakala Ravindra Reddy (1 supra) is subjected to challenge before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
SLP No.3574 of 2024, preferred by the Income Tax Department, we make it clear that allowing of
the instant writ petition is subject to outcome of the aforesaid SLP preferred by the Revenue against
the decision of this High Court in the case of Kanakala Ravindra Reddy (1 supra). This, in other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53169758/ 67
Dr Ujwala Nagaraja Rao Jagdale vs The Assistant Commissioner Of Income ... on 28 August, 2025
words, would mean that either of the parties, if they so want, may move an appropriate petition
seeking revival of this writ petition in the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
pending SLP on the very same issue.
19. Accordingly, the instant writ petition stands allowed in favour of the assessee so far as the issue
of jurisdiction is concerned. As a consequence, the impugned notice under challenge under Sections
148-A and 148 stands set aside/quashed. The consequential orders, if any, also stand set
aside/quashed in similar terms as have been passed by this High Court in the case of Kankanala
Ravindra Reddy (1 supra). There shall be no order as to costs."

12. Respective learned senior counsel representing the parties would seek similar order at the hands
of this Court. In the light of the issue pending before the Apex Court and division benches of
different High Courts noticing the pendency of proceedings before the Apex Court thought it fit to
set at naught the notices and all further proceedings, reserving liberty to the revenue to reopen the
proceedings in the event the Apex Court would hold in favour of the revenue. I am in respectful
agreement of the decisions rendered by different High Courts and submissions made by the
respective learned senior counsel for the petitioners, would become acceptable.
13. I, therefore, pass the following:
ORDER
(i) The impugned show cause notices issued by the jurisdictional Assessing Officer
outside the scope of Section 151-A of the Act stand obliterated. All further
proceedings initiated thereto, challenged in these cases would stand quashed.
(ii) Liberty is reserved to the respondents - revenue to revive all these petitions in the
event the Apex Court would hold in favour of the Revenue in the pending before it.
