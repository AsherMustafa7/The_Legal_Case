ORDER
(01/05/2019) This petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has been filed against the
order dated 16-9-2013 passed by State High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, by which the
Scheduled Caste Certificate dated 6-11-2008, issued in favour of the petitioner has been cancelled.
2. This Court by order dated 9-10-2013, had rejected I.A. No. 7572/2013, which was an application
for stay of impugned order dated 16-9-2013. Being aggrieved by the order of the Co-ordinate Bench,
the petitioner had filed a Writ Appeal No.502/2013, and the interim order dated 9-10-2013 was set
aside, and W.A. No.502/2013 was allowed and the impugned order dated 16-9-2013 was stayed.
Thus, by virtue of order (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) dated 25-10-2013, the effect and
operation of impugned order dated 16-9- 2013 has been stayed.
3. Before considering the facts of the case, it would be appropriate to consider I.A. No.635/2019
filed by one Ladduram Kori, through his Counsel Shri N.S. Kirar, Advocate seeking permission to
intervene. The application has been opposed by the petitioner, on the ground that he is not an
aggrieved person. In reply, it is submitted by the Counsel for the intervenor that as per the
guidelines dated 8-9-1997, a public notice is also required to be given by the High Power Caste

Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Scrutiny Committee, therefore, any person can oppose the claim of the petitioner. During the
arguments, it was submitted by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that Shri N.S. Kirar, Advocate, should
not appear for the intervenor, as earlier Shri N.S. Kirar, Advocate had appeared on behalf of the
State and he had access to the record of the Committee. The objection raised by the Counsel for the
petitioner was opposed by Shri N.S. Kirar, Advocate. However, Shri N.S. Kirar did not dispute that
earlier in the capacity of Govt. Advocate, he had an access to the record of the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee. After some heated arguments, the Counsel for the petitioner, agreed that he
would not raise the preliminary objection with regard to the appearance of Shri N.S. Kirar, and Shri
N.S. Kirar, also agreed not to argue on behalf of the intervenor. Accordingly, I.A. No. 635/2019 for
intervention is hereby dismissed.
4. By order dated 6-12-2018, this Court had imposed the cost of Rs.20,000/- on the respondents.
The office report dated 11-1-2019 (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) (wrongly mentioned as
11-1-2018) shows that the cost was not deposited by 11-1-2019. The receipt of the cost has also not
been placed on record. Thus, it is not clear that whether the respondents have deposited the cost of
Rs.20,000/- after 11-1-2019 or not. Accordingly, this Court by order dated 18-2-2019 had observed
that since, the cost has not been deposited therefore, the right of the respondent to defend the writ
petition stands forfeited. However, by the same order, the Counsel for respondent/State was
directed to produce the record of the Scrutiny Committee positively on the next date of hearing. On
12-3-2019, the entire record pertaining to the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee was available
with the Counsel for the State and since, there was an interim order staying the effect and operation
of Annexure P/10 dated 16-9-2013, therefore, it was observed that it would be appropriate to hear
the matter at an early date and accordingly, the office was directed to list the case for hearing on any
Thursday in the month of April.
5. In spite of the clear direction of this Court, the office listed this case on 22-4-2019 (i.e., on
Monday), therefore, this Court directed the office to list this case on 25-4-2019 (i.e., on Last
Thursday of the month of April) and the Counsel for the State was directed to keep the original
record of the proceedings available at the time of final hearing.
6. The case was taken up for hearing on 25-4-2019, then a statement was made by the Counsel for
the State, that the original record is not available. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court had already
observed on 12-3-2019 that the entire record of the Committee is available with the (Jaipal Singh Vs.
State of M.P. and others) Govt. Advocate, and since, the interim order is in operation, therefore, the
matter shall be heard finally, and on 22-4-2019, the Counsel for the State was specifically directed to
keep the record of the Committee available at the time of final hearing, but still the record of the
Committee has not been produced. Surprisingly, when the record of the Committee was available on
12-3-2019 (as observed by Co-ordinate Bench in its order), then why the record is not being
produced, is also not known. At this stage, it is submitted by the Counsel for the State that although
the right to defend the writ petition has already been forfeited due to non-deposit of the cost, but the
documents of proceedings of the Committee, filed along with the writ petition may be considered.
Accordingly, the documents pertaining to the proceedings of the Committee filed along with the
return of the State shall be considered.

7. Thus, it is made clear that only the documents annexed with the Writ Petition, Rejoinder and
documents pertaining to the proceedings of the Committee, which have been annexed with the
Return, shall be taken into consideration. Further, only those documents, which are the part of
return shall be taken into consideration, which would be referred by the Petitioner.
8. Challenging the order dated 16-9-2013, it is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner, that
earlier, the Petitioner was granted a Caste Certificate dated 2-12-1999, thereby certifying that the
petitioner belongs to "OBC". In the month of December, 1999, the office of President, Municipal
Council, Ashoknagar was reserved for "OBC" category and the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and
others) petitioner had also contested the said election on the strength of "OBC" certificate dated
2-12-1999, whereas on Baijnath Sahu, had also contested the election. It appears, the petitioner
defeated Baijnath Sahu in the election for the post of President, Municipal Council, Ashoknagar.
Baijnath Sahu, filed a writ petition No.1330/2012 before the High Court, seeking the following
relief(s) :
(i) That, the respondents be directed to initiate criminal proceedings under Section 420,467,405
and 468 of the Indian Penal Code against respondent no.4 for procuring forged certificate and
accordingly, he be punished.
(ii) That, the respondent no.4 be held not qualified to hold the office of the President Municipal
Council, Ashoknagar reserved for "OBC" category and he be directed to vacate such office forthwith.
(iii) That, the respondent no.4 be directed to pay a heavy cost for holding office of President,
Municipality Ashok Nagar for which he is not qualified.
(iv) Other relief doing justice in the matter including cost be ordered.
9. The Petition filed by Baijnath Sahu, was disposed of by this Court by order dated 12-8-2002,
which reads as under :
"The grievance in this Public Interest Litigation is that respondent no.4 has been
elected as President of the Municipal Council, Ashoknagar on false and fabricated
caste-certificate. It is not disputed that an election-petition against respondent no.4
and a writ petition before the learned Single Judge in respect of election of
respondent no.4 is also pending. However, the petitioner, who is also a lost candidate
can submit objections in the election- petition and also before the Writ Court. That
apart, remedy as provided under the Government Circular dated 1-8-1996, a copy of
which is annexed with the writ petition as Annexure P/10, provides for enquiry and
taking action in respect of the forged caste- certificate, was not availed of by the
petitioner. The (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) Petitioner, in case, if
makes any complaint under the afaoresaid Circular of the Governmentthe Competent
Authority can take action in that regard and decide the same expeditiously.
This Public Interest Litigation is disposed of with the directions made hereinabove".

Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
10. Thereafter, it appears that the matter was taken up by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee
and by order dated 23-2-2004, the "OBC" certificate dated 2-12-1999 issued in favour of the
petitioner was cancelled.
11. The Petitioner filed a Writ Petition No.520/2004, challenging the order dated 23-2-2004, which
was allowed by this Court by order dated 3-9-2004 on the ground of lack of quorum and the matter
was remanded back to the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee for decision afresh.
12. The matter was again considered by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee and by order
dated 11-11-2004, the "OBC" Caste Certificate of the petitioner was cancelled.
13. Accordingly, by order dated 4-3-2004, the Directorate Backward Class and Minority Welfare,
Bhopal, cancelled the "OBC" certificate dated 2-12-1999 which was granted by the Tahsildar in
favour of the Petitioner.
14. It appears that thereafter, the petitioner once again obtained the certificate of Scheduled Caste
on 6-11-2008 (Annexure P/8).
15. By referring to the return filed by the respondents, it is submitted by the Counsel for the
Petitioner that it appears that one Ramesh Kumar Itoria, Member District Congress Committee and
Representative Member (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) of Parliament, made a written
complaint to Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Government of
India alleging that forged Caste Certificates have been obtained by various persons, including the
petitioner. Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Government of
India in his turn, by letter dated 30-9-2010, forwarded the said complaint to the then Chief Minister
of State of M.P. Accordingly, the matter was referred to High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee for
verification of Caste Certificate of the petitioner.
16. It appears that by order dated 6-8-2013, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee issued
notices to the petitioner, for his appearance on 12-8-2013. It was reported by the Collector Guna,
that the Sub Divisional Officer was sent to the house of the petitioner, for service of notice, however,
he was not in the house. The report given by S.D.O. was also annexed according to which, the
Sub-Divisional Officer, Guna received the copy of the notices on 8-8-2013 and accordingly, he went
to the house of the petitioner, but he was not found in the house, and the family members informed
the S.D.O., that the petitioner would be available on the next day. On 9-8-2013, when the SDO again
went to the house of the petitioner, then again he was not available in the house. Again on 10-8-
2013, no one was found in the house, accordingly, the notice could not be served personally on the
petitioner. Thereafter, the notice was read over to the relatives and neighbours and they were
requested to inform the petitioner. One copy of the notice was affixed on the house and the (Jaipal
Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) signatures of the neighbourers were obtained. The entire
proceedings were got videographed. SMS was sent on the mobile of the petitioner and news was also
uploaded on the Facebook account of the petitioner. News was also published in the local print and
electronic media. However, on 12-8-2013, the petitioner did not appear before the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee. Seven complainants appeared against the petitioner, and therefore, their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 4
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
statements were recorded.
17. However, in order to give another opportunity of hearing, the High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee, decided to issue fresh notice to the petitioner and accordingly, fresh notice was issued
on 7-9-2013 for service of the same through Collector, Guna, for his appearance on 16-9- 2013.
Again the Collector, Guna by his report dated 13-9-2013 informed that the notice was received by
him on 12-9-2013. He and Tahsildar, Ashoknagar tried to contact the petitioner, but he was not
available. Three attempts were made to serve the notice but every time, the same could not be
served as the house was locked. Accordingly, the notice was read over to his relatives and
neighbourers, and request was made to inform the petitioner. A copy of the notice was affixed on the
house of the petitioner and panchnama was prepared. The entire efforts were videographed. SMS
was also sent on the mobile phone of the petitioner and news was also uploaded on the Facebook
account of the petitioner. Public notice was also given by beat of drums and news was also published
in the newspaper. On 16-9-2013 also, the Petitioner did not appear before the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee and accordingly, it was held that (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) the
entire attempt of the petitioner is to somehow keep the matter pending and accordingly, an ex parte
final order dated 16-9-2013 was passed and the Caste certificate of Scheduled Caste dated 6-11-2008
was cancelled on the ground that the same was issued on the basis of forged documents. Order
dated 16-9-2013 reads as under :

18. The order dated 16-9-2013, has been challenged by the petitioner in the present petition.
19. Challenging the order dated 16-9-2013 (Annexure P/8), it is submitted by the Counsel for the
petitioner, that :
i- That the complaint was politically motivated, and the findings given by the High
Power Caste Scrutiny Committee are also politically motivated, as BJP was in power,
whereas the petitioner belongs to Congress Party;
ii- That in the year 2004, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee had considered
the Caste Certificate of "OBC"
and at that time, the Caste Certificate of Scheduled Caste (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of
M.P. and others) was also before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee and
since, no comments against the "SC" Certificate, were made by the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee in its final order dated 11-11-2004, therefore, it has to be
presumed that the Caste Certificate of Scheduled Caste, issued in favour of the
petitioner, was upheld by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, therefore, the
Caste Certificate of the petitioner cannot be examined again and again;
iii- There was lack of quorum as the final order has been signed by only three
members out of four;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 9
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
iv- No notice was served upon the petitioner;
v- Even otherwise, 15 days notice was not issued;
vi- The provisions of Order 5 C.P.C. were not followed.
20. Refuting the submissions made by the Counsel for the Petitioner, it is submitted by the Counsel
for the respondents, that the petitioner has not clarified, as to how he was prejudiced by non-service
of 15 days notice. Further, in fact he was duly served by substituted service of publication and in
spite of that, he did not appear before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee. It is further
submitted that the attempts made by the authorities to serve the notice, clearly shows that the
petitioner was desperately avoiding the service of notice. Further, merely because the final order was
not signed by one of the member would not make the order vulnerable as the said order was signed
by the fourth member on a (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) later date. Furthermore, in
the earlier proceedings before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, the Caste Certificate of
"OBC" was in question, therefore, it was not necessary for the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee
to make any comment on the Caste Certificate of Scheduled Caste.
21. Heard the learned Counsel for the Parties.
i- That the complaint was politically motivated, and the findings given by the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee are also politically motivated, as BJP was in power, whereas the petitioner
belongs to Congress Party.
22. By referring to the complaint of Ramesh Kumar Itoria, which has been placed on record by the
respondents at page 28 of the return, it is submitted by Shri Vinod Bhardwaj, Senior Advocate that
it is clear that one Ramesh Kumar Itoria, who was the member of District Congress Committee and
Representative of the Member of Parliament had made a written complaint to Shri Jyotiraditya M.
Scindia, who was Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Government of India, complaining
that various persons, including the petitioner has obtained forged Caste Certificates, which are being
misused by them, therefore, these unscrupulous persons may be punished. It appears that Shri
Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, who was Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Government of
India, wrote D.O. No. 1532 MOS (C&I)MP/2010 dated 30-9-2010 and forwarded the complaint to
the then Chief Minister of State of M.P. for necessary action. This letter of Shri Jotiraditya M. (Jaipal
Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) Scindia is filed at page No. 27 of the Return. In its turn, the office
of the then Chief Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, forwarded the complaint to the Principal
Secretary, Adim Jati Kalyan Vibhag by letter dated 19-10-2010 and accordingly, the matter reached
the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee for enquiry.
23. It is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner, that since the BJP was the ruling party in the
State of Madhya Pradesh, therefore, it got apprehensive, as the elections of State Legislative
Assembly were due somewhere in Nov/Dec. 2013, therefore, in order to prevent the petitioner from
contesting the election as "SC" candidate, the action was taken. Para 5.5 of the writ petition reads as
under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 10
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
"5.5 That, the Legislative Assembly seat Ashoknagar (MP) is reserved for "Scheduled
Caste" candidates.
The Legislative Assembly elections in MP are due somewhere in Nov/Dec 2013. To prevent
petitioner from contesting the election as "SC" candidate, his political rivals in BJP have pressurized
MP government to cancel Petitioner's "SC" certificate. The BJP fears that petitioner is a popular
candidate and if gets ticket from Congress would win in election as "SC" candidate from Congress
party at Ashoknagar seat of Legislative Assembly."
24. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the petitioner regarding political
interference/vindictiveness.
25. From complaint dated 22-9-2010 made by Ramesh Kumar Itoria, it is clear that the complainant
was Member District Congress Committee and the representative of Member of Parliament and the
complaint was made on a letter head with election symbol of National Congress Party. Thus, it is
clear that the complaint was made by a Member of the District (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and
others) Congress Party, and the petitioner has also claimed that he is likely to contest the election as
"SC" candidate from Congress Party. Further, the complaint was made to Shri Jyotiraditya M.
Scindia, who was Minister of State for Commerce & Industry, Government of India. This Court can
take judicial notice of the fact that National Congress Party was in power in the Centre. Thus, it is
clear that the complaint was made to the Minister belonging to the National Congress Party.
Further, the complaint was forwarded by Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia, Minister of State for
Commerce & Industry, Government of India to Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the then Chief Minister,
and according to the petitioner, BJP was in power in the State. Thus, it is clear that in the present
case, the complaint was made by a member of National Congress Party to a Minister belonging to
National Congress Party, and the concerned Minister, in his turn, forwarded the complaint to the
then Chief Minister. Therefore, the submission made by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that the BJP
had an apprehension that the petitioner would win the election as a "SC" candidate, from Congress
Party, and therefore, false case has been created against him, cannot be accepted. Hence, the first
submission made by the Counsel for the petitioner, that in fact he is the victim of political vendetta
is hereby rejected.
ii- That in the year 2004, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee had considered the Caste
Certificate of "OBC" and at that time, the Caste Certificate of Scheduled Caste was also before the
High Power Caste (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) Scrutiny Committee and since, no
comments were made by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee in its final order dated
11-11-2004, therefore, it has to be presumed that the Caste Certificate of Scheduled Caste, issued in
favour of the petitioner, was upheld by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, therefore, the
Caste Certificate of the petitioner cannot be examined again and again.
26. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the Petitioner. To substantiate the above
mentioned submissions, it is submitted by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that one Baijnath Sahu,
had filed a Writ Petition before the High Court of M.P., Gwalior Bench, which was registered as W.P.
No.1330 of 2002. The copy of the Writ Petition has been placed on record, which is at page 29 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 11
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Writ Petition. The Counsel for the Petitioner has referred to Paras 6, 7 and 8 of the said Writ
Petition, which reads as under :
6. That, thereafter elections of the Member Zila Panchayat Guna tookplace in the year
1999 where he submitted his nomination as Scheduled Caste candidate. Copy of the
nomination form of respondent no. 4 is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure
P/4.
7. That, now the respondent no. 4 has submitted a caste certificate of "OBC" category
and on that basis he has been elected as President Municipal Council, Ashoknagar as
"OBC" candidate. Copy of his caste certificate issued by Tehsildar is annexed
herewith and marked as Annex. P/5.
8. That, from the above facts it is apparent that the respondent no. 4 has obtained
forged certificates of "OBC" and SC Category. Copy of hte certifiate as SC candidate is
annexed and marked as Annexure (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) P/6.
27. It is submitted that, this writ petition was finally disposed of by this Court by order dated
12-8-2002, with a direction, if the petitioner, in case, if makes any complaint under the aforesaid
circular of the Government, the competent Authority can take action in this regard and decide the
same expeditiously. Thus, it is submitted that when High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee took up
the matter in the year 2004, then the "OBC" certificate as well as the "SC" certificate of the
petitioner were before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee but in spite of that the High Power
Caste Scrutiny Committee did not touch the "SC" Certificate of the Petitioner and had merely
cancelled the "OBC" certificate of the Petitioner, therefore, the subsequent enquiry by High Power
Caste Scrutiny Committee was unwarranted and thus, it is politically motivated.
28. Considered the submissions. It is clear from the record, that initially, the High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee by order dated 25-2- 2004 had cancelled the "OBC" certificate of the Petitioner,
which was challenged by him by filing a Writ Petition No.520/2004 and the said writ petition was
disposed of by order dated 3-9-2004, and the order dated 25- 2-2004, passed by the High Power
Caste Scrutiny Committee was set aside on the ground of lack of quorum and the matter was
remanded back for consideration afresh. Thereafter, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee
passed a fresh order on 11-11-2004 and cancelled the "OBC" certificate of the petitioner. The
relevant portion of the order dated 11- (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) 11-2004 is
reproduced as under :

29. It is pertinent to note here that the petitioner accepted the findings given by the High Power
Caste Scrutiny Committee and did not challenge (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) the
findings given by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee and thus, the "OBC" certificate dated
2-12-1999 issued in favour of the petitioner stood cancelled. Therefore, it is clear that the findings of
facts and certain observations regarding political advantage, made by the High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee in its order dated 11-11-2004 were never challenged by the petitioner and thus, today
also they holds the field.
30. Thus, it is clear from order dated 11-11-2004, that earlier the petitioner had submitted his
nomination form as a candidate of "General Category" for the post of Member Krishi Upaj Mandi,
and thereafter, in year 1999, he submitted his nomination paper for the post of Member Zila
Panchayat, Ashoknagar as a "SC" candidate. Thereafter, he contested the election for the post of
President Municipal Council as a "OBC" candidate, and again on 6-11-2008, he obtained the caste
certificate of "SC".
31. Thus, it appears that the petitioner has changed his Caste from time to time as per his
convenience.
32. As per the order dated 11-11-2004, passed by the earlier High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee,
the petitioner had obtained the Caste Certificate of "OBC" on 2-11-1999, whereas according to the
contents of WP No.1330/2002, the election for the post of President, Municipal Council,
Ashoknagar were held in the month of December 1999 (Kindly see para 5.2 of the Writ Petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 13
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
No.1330/2002), and the petitioner had contested the said election as "OBC" candidate. Thus, it is
clear that the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) petitioner had obtained the "OBC"
certificate, just few days before election for the post of President, Municipal Council, Ashoknagar.
33. Now, the present certificate of "SC" was issued to the petitioner on 6-11-2008. This Court can
take judicial notice of the fact, that the election for the State Legislative Assembly were held on 27 th
of Nov. 2008. However, it is not known that whether the petitioner had contested the said election
or not, but one thing is clear, that again just few days prior to the election for State Legislative
Assembly, the petitioner had obtained the present caste certificate of "SC".
34. As the "SC" certificate, in question in the present petition is dated 6-11-2008 and since, the
meeting of the earlier High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee was held on 11-11-2004, and since, the
present Caste Certificate of "SC" was not in existence, therefore, there was no occasion for the High
Power Caste Scrutiny Committee to consider the "SC" certificate dated 6-11-2008, issued in favour
of the petitioner. It is submitted by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that the earlier High Power Caste
Scrutiny Committee was already aware of the fact, that earlier the petitioner had submitted his
nomination papers as "SC" candidate, therefore, it should have commented on the "SC" certificate of
the petitioner, therefore, in absence of such observations, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee
cannot be permitted to reopen the same issue. Consider the submissions made by the Counsel for
the Petitioner.
35. The Counsel for the Petitioner was asked as to whether the petitioner was holding any "SC"
Certificate on 2-11-1999 when the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) "OBC" certificate was
issued in his favour and if he was having such certificate, then what happened to the said "SC"
certificate and if the petitioner was belonging to "SC" candidate, then why he changed his caste, and
why he obtained the "OBC" certificate and whether he had withdrawn his earlier "SC" certificate or
not? It is submitted by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that as the present petition has been filed
against the order dated 16-9-2013 (Annexure P/8), therefore, there is no pleading to meet out the
above mentioned questions. He further submitted that, if any opportunity is granted, then the
petitioner would clarify the above mentioned facts before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee.
However, this fact is admitted by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that the "SC" certificate in question
was issued on 6-11-2008, therefore, there was no occasion for the earlier High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee, to consider that whether the "SC" certificate dated 6-11-2008 was properly issued or
not?
36. Thus, the second contention raised by the Counsel for the petitioner is rejected.
iii- There was lack of quorum as the final order has been signed by only three members out of four.
37. By referring to circular dated 8-9-1997 (Annexure R/4), it is submitted by the Counsel for the
Petitioner, that the State Govt. has constituted a High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee consisting of
four members i.e.,
1. Principal Secretary/Secretary, Adim Jati aur Anusuchit Jati Kalyan Vibhag.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 14
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
2. Director, Anusuchit Jati Vikas
3. A Specialist, having knowledge about S.C., as nominated by the Chairman.
4. Secretary, Anusuchit Jati Aayog.
38. By referring to the Attendance Sheet (Annexure R/10), it is submitted by the Counsel for the
Petitioner, that the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee of 5 members i.e., 1. Secretary, Anusuchit
Jati Kalyan Vighag, 2. Commissioner, Anusuchit Jati Vibhag, 3. Director, Adim Jati Anusandhan
and Vikas Vibhag, 4. Secretary, Anusuchit Jati Aayog and an 5. Director, National Anusuchit Jati
Aayog was constituted. From attendance Sheet (Annexure R/10), it is clear that 4 members out of 5
were present and Director, National Anusuchit Jati Aayog was absent. However, the final order was
signed by three members and was not signed by Joint Director, Adim Jati Anusandhan and Vikas
Sansthan Bhopal. By referring to the note sheet dated 25-9-2013 (Annexure R/11), it is submitted by
the Counsel for the petitioner, that even if Shri G.P. Patel, had signed the order at a later stage, it
would not cure the defect and thus, the order dated 16-9-2013 is bad in the eyes of law for the reason
that the same was not signed by all the four members of the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee.
39. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the Petitioner.
40. It is clear from the circular dated 8-9-1997, a Four Member Committee has to be constituted,
whereas from the attendance sheet, it appears that the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee of 5
members was constituted. On 16-9-2013, one member of the Committee was absent, (Jaipal Singh
Vs. State of M.P. and others) and the attendance sheet was signed by remaining 4 members,
however, the order dated 16-9-2013 was signed by only three members and from the note sheet
dated 25-9-2013, it appears that the fourth member was on leave on 25-9-2013, therefore, his
signatures could not be obtained.
41. Thus, the moot question for determination is that whether a majority decision taken by a
Committee would stand vitiated only on the ground that either the remaining members had not
attended the meeting or had not signed the decision of the Committee. It is submitted by the
Counsel for the petitioner, that such a decision would be bad because of lack of quorum.
42. To consider the submissions made by the Counsel for the petitioner, it would be appropriate to
consider the law governing the field.
43. The Supreme Court in the case of People's Union for Civil Liberties Vs. Union of India reported
in (2005) 5 SCC 363 has held as under :
"15. It is nextly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that there was no
proper consultation amongst the members of the Selection Committee. This is based
on the fact that one of the members who was then the Leader of Opposition in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 15
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Council of States did not respond to the intimation sent to him in regard to the
selection of the members since he was in hospital at that point of time. A perusal of
the Act does not show that there is any quorum fixed for the selection nor does it
provide for any meeting nor has any particular procedure been provided for. Under
the Act, consultation by circulation is not impermissible. In such a situation, if one
out of six did not respond, it would not vitiate the opinion of the other five members.
On the contrary sub-section (2) of Section 4 specifically says that no appointment of a
Chairperson or a member shall be invalid merely by reason of any vacancy in the
Committee. In the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) instant case the Prime
Minister, the Speaker of the House of the People, Minister in charge of the Ministry
of Home Affairs in the Government of India, Leader of Opposition in the House of
the People and Deputy Chairman of the Council of States having agreed on the
appointment of the second respondent, we find no statutory error in the appointment
of the second respondent."
The Supreme Court in the case of Iswharichand VS. Satyanarain Sinha and others reported in AIR
1972 SC 1812 has held as under :
"5..........It is rather unfortunate that the appellant's Writ Petition was dismissed in
limited and without a proper appreciation of all the relevant facts. There is little
doubt that the impugned Order made by the Chancellor was based entirely on the
legality of the meeting where only two out of three members were present when the
name of the appellant was recommended. The High Court delivered into the
correspondence to sustain the order of the Chancellor on grounds other than those
relied upon by him in that order for dismissing the Writ Petition in limine, which in
our view, was not justified. It is also not denied that the meeting held by two of the
three members on the 4th April 1970 was legal because sufficient notice was given to
all the three members. If for one reason or the other one of them could not attend,
that does not make the meeting of others illegal. In such circumstances, where there
is no rule or regulation or any other provision for fixing the quorum, the presence of
the majority of the members would constitute it a valid meeting and matters
considered there at cannot be held to be invalid.
6. This proposition is well recognised and is also so stated in Halsbury's Laws of
England, Third Edition (Vol. IX, page 48, Para 95). It is, therefore, unnecessary to
refer to any decisions on the subject. In the view we have taken, the appeal is allowed
with costs against respondent 3, the order of the Chancellor revoking the
appointment of the appellant is set aside and the appellant is declared to have been
validly appointed as Vice-Chancellor Of the Saugar University as from the 22nd June
1970."
A Division Bench of Delhi High Court, by judgment dated 12-3-2018 (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P.
and others) passed in the case of Talluri Srinivas Vs. Union of India in W.P. (C) 8341/2017 has held
as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 16
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
"15. In W.P. (C) No. 2674/2012, Kavita Meena & Ors. Vs. Government of National
Capital Territory of Delhi & Ors. and other connected matters decided on 22nd May,
2012, challenge was regarding composition of Selection Committee, which as per
column 13 of the Recruitment Rules, was to consist of Chairman, SCERT, Director,
SCERT, Director of Education and representative of SC/ST to be nominated by
Chairman, SCERT. It had transpired that the Chairman, SCERT and Director
Education, Department of Education had not participated in some of the meetings
when interviews were held. Issue was whether the Selection Committee was duly
constituted in view of the Rule position. It was held as under:-
"5. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners contended that once
the majority of the members of the Selection Committee were present in the
interviews held for selecting candidates, the selection process cannot be said to have
been vitiated. It was also contended that as no quorum has been prescribed under the
Recruitment Rules, the only requirement was that the majority of the members of the
Committee should be present. In the present case, there were actually 4 to 5 members
present in each of the interviews held during the period from 08.07.2010 to
28.07.2010. Therefore, the majority of the members of the Selection Committee were
present in each and every interview meeting which was held. It was also submitted on
behalf of the petitioners that the absence of the Chairman of SCERT did not make
any difference inasmuch as the members present could nominate one amongst them
to chair the meetings. In the present case, all the meetings were chaired by the
Director, SCERT. The learned counsel for the petitioners placed reliance on two
decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Ishwar Chandra v. Satyanarain Sinha &
Ors (1972) 3 SSC 383 and People(cid:132)s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India and
Anr. (2005) 5 SCC 363 in support of the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
aforesaid contention.
6. The learned counsel for the respondents, who were applicants before the Tribunal,
reiterated their stand before the Tribunal and supported the decision of the Tribunal.
In addition, they referred the decision in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh & Anr.
v. Dr. Mohanjit Singh and Ors. 1988 (Supp) SCC 562. It was contended that because
of the said decision, the absence of a person from the Selection Committee vitiated
the selection process.
7. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the
decision rendered by the Tribunal is not in accordance with law and has to be set
aside. The reason is that the two Supreme Court(cid:132)s decisions cited by the learned
counsel for the petitioners clearly hold the field and in so far as the decision cited by
the learned counsel for the respondents is concerned, that is clearly distinguishable.
8. In Ishwar Chandra (supra), the case before the Supreme Court was concerning the
appointment of the Vice-Chancellor of Saugar University. For the purpose of the
appointment of the Vice- Chancellor, a Selection Committee was to be constituted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 17
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
under Section 13(2) of the University of Saugar Act, 1946. The Committee to be
constituted was to consist of three persons; two of whom were to be elected by the
Executive Council by single transferable vote from amongst persons not connected
with the University or a College and the third was to be nominated by the Chancellor
who was also empowered to appoint one of them as Chairman of the Committee. The
two persons elected by the Executive Council of the University were Mr G.K. Shinde,
a former Chief Justice of a High Court and Justice T.P. Naik of the Madhya Pradesh
High Court while the third member, Shri C.B. Agarwal, a former Judge of the
Allahabad High Court, was nominated by the Chancellor. Justice Naik was, however,
unable to attend the meeting which was slated to be held on 04.04.1970 and in his
absence the other two persons, namely, Shri Shinde and Shri (Jaipal Singh Vs. State
of M.P. and others) Agrawal met as a Committee and submitted a panel of names
from which the Chancellor appointed the appellant before the Supreme Court as
Vice-Chancellor. The question that arose was whether only two members of the
Committee, who were present, could have validly selected the appellant as a
ViceChancellor. The Supreme Court, after considering the various facts and
circumstances of the case, came to the following conclusion:-
"If for one reason or the other one of them could not attend, that does not make the
meeting of others illegal. In such circumstances, where there is no rule or regulation
or any other provision for fixing the quorum, the presence of the majority of the
members would constitute it a valid meeting and matters considered there at cannot
be held to be invalid".
9. The Supreme Court in arriving at this conclusion has placed reliance on the said proposition as
stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, Third Edition (Vol. IX, page 48, para
95), which reads as under:-.
"95. Presence of quorum necessary. The acts of a corporation, other than a trading
corporation, are those of the major part of the corporators, corporately assembled. In
other words, in the absence of special custom or of special provision in the
constitution, the major part must be present at the meeting, and of that major part
there must be a majority in favour of the act or resolution contemplated. Where,
therefore, a corporation consists of thirteen members, there ought to be at least seven
present to form a valid meeting, and the act of the majority of these seven or greater
number will bind the corporation. In considering whether the requisite number is
present, only those members must be included who are competent to take part in the
particular business before the meeting. The power of doing a corporate act may,
however, be specially delegated to a particular number of members, in which case, in
the absence of any other provision, the method of procedure applicable to the body at
large will be applied to (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) the select body.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 18
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
If a corporate act is to be done by a definite body along, or by a definite body coupled
with an indefinite body, a majority of the definite body must be present.
Where a corporation is composed of several select bodies, the general rule is that a
majority of each select body must be present at a corporate meeting; but this rule will
not be applied in the absence of express direction in the constitution, if its application
would lead to an absurdity or an impossibility. Thus, where such a select body is
composed of four members and two of them happen to vacate their offices at the
same time, an election will be valid although only the remaining two are present at
it."
10. The second decision relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner was that of People(cid:132)s
Union for Civil Liberties (supra). In that case, the appointment of a member of the National Human
Rights Commission was in question. Section 4 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993,
stipulated that the appointment of Chairperson and other Members of the National Human Rights
Commission has to be made, after obtaining recommendations of a Committee comprising:-
The Prime Minister • The Speaker of the House of People • The Minister Incharge of
the Ministry of Home Affairs in the Government of India • Leader of Opposition in
the House of People • Leader of Opposition in the Council of States • Deputy
Chairman of the Council of States It so happened that the selection in the case before
the Supreme Court took place by a Committee in which the Leader of Opposition in
the House of People was absent. Therefore, the selection was under challenge. The
Supreme Court held as under:-
"15. It is nextly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that there was no
proper consultation amongst the members of the Selection Committee. This is based
on the fact (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) that one of the members who
was then the leader of the Opposition in the Council of the States did not respond to
the intimation sent to him in regard to the selection of the members since he was in
the hospital at that point of time. A perusal of the Act does not show that there is any
quorum fixed for the selection nor does it provide for any meeting nor any particular
procedure has been provided. Under the Act consultation by circulation is not
impermissible. In such a situation, if one out of six did not respond, it would not
vitiate the opinion of the other five Members. On the contrary Subclause 2 of Section
4 specifically says that no appointment of a Chairperson or a member shall be invalid
merely by reason of any vacancy in the Committee. In the instant case the Prime
Minister, the Speaker of the House of the People, Minister Incharge of the Ministry of
Home Affairs in the Government of India, Leader of Opposition in the House of
People and Deputy Chairman of the Council of States having agreed on the
appointment of the second respondent, we find no statutory error in the appointment
of the second respondent."

Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
20. In Ram Autar Santosh Kumar vs. State of Bihar & Ors., AIR 1987 Patna 13, a Full
Bench of the Patna High Court had examined the question whether a rule prescribing
quorum for Assessment Sub-Committee constituted under Section 27-A(1) of the
Bihar Agricultural Produce Market Act, 1961 was ultra vires the main provision or the
rule making power. Section 27A(1) had stipulated that an Assessment
Sub-Committee shall consist of Chairman, Vice Chairman and Secretary of the
Market Committee for the purpose of assessment of levy and fee. It did not prescribe
any minimum quorum. Quorum for Assessment Sub-Committee prescribed by Rule
88 was two members who had the discretion to refer the case to a Bench of all
members of the Sub- Committee. For several reasons, the challenge was rejected.
What is of importance for the present decision are the observations in paragraph 20
of the said judgment which reads :
"20. In this context one may perhaps equally (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and
others) highlight the anomalous result which must flow herein from holding that
each and every member of the Assessment Sub-Committee must always attend
throughout each and every proceeding of an assessment. Would it be necessary that
all the three members must sit together like a regular Full Bench of a Court of Law to
hear and decide every case of the assessment of Market fee? Would it be even
possible or practicable to do so? If one of the members of the Assessment
Sub-Committee was taken ill or otherwise becomes unable to attend for some time
the whole proceedings in all the existing cases be stalled and the other members of
the Committee debarred from functioning or deciding the cases by themselves. If
such were to be the situation, each member can stall the function of the Assessment
Sub-Committee to the state of total paralysis. The Assessment Sub-Committee would
be eventually rendered nugatory during the period of absence of any of its members.
Identical situation would arise in the case of illness, or failure to attend even one of
the many meetings for one or the other reasons for each one of its members. An
interpretation which would lead to such anomalous, if not mischievous, results has,
therefore, to be avoided even on the larger canons of construction."
Observations and reasoning above is cogent and we respectfully agree. In an earlier paragraph, the
Full Bench had rejected the contention that the question of quorum of the Sub-Committee must be
decided on the same parameters as quorum of a Court, i.e. the quorum of a Division Bench or
quorum fixed for the Larger Bench. It was held that the said analogy should not and cannot be
drawn for determining the question of quorum of statutory bodies performing quasi-judicial
functions. The contention that in case the third member had participated, he may have taken a
contrary view and may have converted the other two members to his view was rejected as an
assumption based upon surmises and conjectures. This contingency, it was observed, was basic and
inherent in every statutory body for which quorum has been lawfully prescribed. Indeed when
minimum quorum of members is prescribed, in fact it becomes (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and
others) the committee/ authority, itself. For arriving at the said finding, the Full Bench referred to
the decision in Ishwar Chandra (supra) and the ratio that when no quorum was prescribed and
majority members were present, the meeting would be legal and valid.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 20
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Reference was also made to the judgment in Punjab University, Chandigarh vs. Vijay Singh Lamba,
AIR 1976 SC 1441 wherein the majority view taken by the Full Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High
Court in judgment reported as Vijay Singh Lamba vs. Punjab University, AIR 1976 P&H 143 was
reversed approving the minority opinion and holding that if the quorum consists of two members
then any two out of three can perform functions of the Standing Committee. Referring to the
requirement of unanimity in the Regulation, it was observed that it refers to unanimity of the
members who for the time being were sitting in the Committee and were the quorum.
21. We would at this stage refer to the decision in Vijay Singh Lamba (supra) wherein the Supreme
Court held that „quorum(cid:132) denotes minimum number of members of any body or persons whose
presence is necessary in order to enable that body to transact its business validly so that its acts may
be lawful. Generally, it would be left to the Committees/Bodies themselves to fix the quorums for
the meetings. However, in the said case, the syndicate which had appointed the Standing Committee
had fixed the quorum, which it was held, was valid. Pertinently it was observed that it would be
inappropriate to draw parallels between such cases and a court proceeding where a matter by law,
the case was required to be heard by Benches of three Judges. Reliance placed by the petitioner on
the said observations would be entirely fallacious and wrong, for the present case statutory
provisions quoted above refer to constitution of the Appellate Authority consisting of five members,
without the enactment specifically prescribing or fixing any quorum. The contention that by default
or in the absence of any provision fixing statutory quorum, all five members of the Appellate
Authority must sit to constitute a valid quorum, otherwise the proceedings before the Appellate
Authority will be illegal and invalid, has to be rejected and refused as fallible and flawed. This
contention has been repeatedly examined and (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) answered
in negative.
44. There is nothing in Circular dated 8-9-1997, to indicate, that in case all the members do not
attend the meeting, then the proceedings of the Committee shall stand vitiated. Furthermore, there
is nothing in the circular to indicate that approval by circulation is not permissible. Thus, if the
signatures of Shri G.P. Patel were obtained on the impugned order subsequently, it would not vitiate
the proceedings/order, because approval by circulation is not prohibited and secondly, the original
order dated 16-9-2013 was already signed by majority of the members of the Committee, thus, it can
be said that the decision dated 16-9-2013, was by a majority of Committee, therefore, it is not
vitiated. Thus, the contention of the petitioner, that the order dated 16-9-2013 is vitiated on account
of lack of quorum and non-signing of order by Shri G.P. Patel, is hereby rejected.
iv- No notice was served upon the petitioner;
v- Even otherwise, 15 days notice was not issued; vi- The provisions of Order 5 C.P.C. were not
followed.
45. For the sake of convenience, all the three arguments advanced by the petitioner shall be
considered conjointly.

46. The Supreme Court in the case of Madhuri Patil Vs. Commr. Tribal Development reported in
(1994) 6 SCC 241 has held as under :
"13. The admission wrongly gained or appointment wrongly obtained on the basis of
false social status certificate necessarily has the effect of depriving the genuine
Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes or "OBC" candidates as enjoined in the
Constitution of the benefits conferred on them by the Constitution. The genuine
candidates are also denied admission to (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
educational institutions or appointments to office or posts under a State for want of
social status certificate. The ineligible or spurious persons who falsely gained entry
resort to dilatory tactics and create hurdles in completion of the inquiries by the
Scrutiny Committee. It is true that the applications for admission to educational
institutions are generally made by a parent, since on that date many a time the
student may be a minor. It is the parent or the guardian who may play fraud claiming
false status certificate. It is, therefore, necessary that the certificates issued are
scrutinised at the earliest and with utmost expedition and promptitude. For that
purpose, it is necessary to streamline the procedure for the issuance of social status
certificates, their scrutiny and their approval, which may be the following:
1. The application for grant of social status certificate shall be made to the Revenue
Sub-Divisional Officer and Deputy Collector or Deputy Commissioner and the
certificate shall be issued by such officer rather than at the Officer, Taluk or Mandal
level.
2. The parent, guardian or the candidate, as the case may be, shall file an affidavit
duly sworn and attested by a competent gazetted officer or non-gazetted officer with
particulars of castes and sub-castes, tribe, tribal community, parts or groups of tribes
or tribal communities, the place from which he originally hails from and other
particulars as may be prescribed by the Directorate concerned.
3. Application for verification of the caste certificate by the Scrutiny Committee shall
be filed at least six months in advance before seeking admission into educational
institution or an appointment to a post.
4. All the State Governments shall constitute a Committee of three officers, namely,
(I) an Additional or Joint Secretary or any officer high-er in rank of the Director of
the department concerned, (II) the Director, Social Welfare/Tribal
Welfare/Backward Class Welfare, as the case may be, and (III) in the case of
Scheduled Castes another officer who has intimate knowledge in the verification and
issuance of the social status certificates. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes, the
Research Officer who has intimate knowledge in identifying the tribes, tribal
communities, parts of or groups of tribes or tribal communities.

Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
5. Each Directorate should constitute a vigilance cell consisting of Senior Deputy Superintendent of
Police in over-all charge and such number of Police Inspectors to investigate into the social status
claims. The Inspector would go to the local place of residence and original place from which the
candidate hails and usually resides or in case of migration to the town or city, the place from which
he originally hailed from. The vigilance officer should personally verify and collect all the facts of the
social status claimed by the candidate or the parent or guardian, as the case may be. He should also
examine the school records, birth registration, if any. He should also examine the parent, guardian
or the candidate in relation to their caste etc. or such other persons who have knowledge of the
social status of the candidate and then submit a report to the Directorate together with all
particulars as envisaged in the pro forma, in particular, of the Scheduled Tribes relating to their
peculiar anthropological and ethnological traits, deity, rituals, customs, mode of marriage, death
ceremonies, method of burial of dead bodies etc. by the castes or tribes or tribal communities
concerned etc.
6. The Director concerned, on receipt of the report from the vigilance officer if he found the claim
for social status to be "not genuine" or 'doubtful' or spurious or falsely or wrongly claimed, the
Director concerned should issue show-cause notice supplying a copy of the report of the vigilance
officer to the candidate by a registered post with acknowledgement due or through the head of the
educational institution concerned in which the candidate is studying or employed. The notice should
indicate that the representation or reply, if any, would be made within two weeks from the date of
the receipt of the notice and in no case on request not more than 30 days from the date of the receipt
of the notice. In case, the candidate seeks for an opportunity of hearing and claims an inquiry to be
made in that behalf, the Director on receipt of such representation/reply shall convene the
committee and the Joint/Additional Secretary as Chairperson who shall give reasonable opportunity
to the candidate/parent/guardian to adduce all evidence in support of their claim. A public notice by
beat of drum or any other convenient mode may be published in the village or locality and if any
person or association opposes (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) such a claim, an
opportunity to adduce evidence may be given to him/it. After giving such opportunity either in
person or through counsel, the Committee may make such inquiry as it deems expedient and
consider the claims vis-à-vis the objections raised by the candidate or opponent and pass an
appropriate order with brief reasons in support thereof.
7. In case the report is in favour of the candidate and found to be genuine and true, no further action
need be taken except where the report or the particulars given are procured or found to be false or
fraudulently obtained and in the latter event the same procedure as is envisaged in para 6 be
followed.
8. Notice contemplated in para 6 should be issued to the parents/guardian also in case candidate is
minor to appear before the Committee with all evidence in his or their support of the claim for the
social status certificates.
9. The inquiry should be completed as expeditiously as possible preferably by day-to-day
proceedings within such period not exceeding two months. If after inquiry, the Caste Scrutiny
Committee finds the claim to be false or spurious, they should pass an order cancelling the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 23
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
certificate issued and confiscate the same. It should communicate within one month from the date
of the conclusion of the proceedings the result of enquiry to the parent/guardian and the applicant.
10. In case of any delay in finalising the proceedings, and in the meanwhile the last date for
admission into an educational institution or appointment to an officer post, is getting expired, the
candidate be admitted by the Principal or such other authority competent in that behalf or
appointed on the basis of the social status certificate already issued or an affidavit duly sworn by the
parent/guardian/candidate before the competent officer or non-official and such admission or
appointment should be only provisional, subject to the result of the inquiry by the Scrutiny
Committee.
11. The order passed by the Committee shall be final and conclusive only subject to the proceedings
under Article 226 of the Constitution.
12. No suit or other proceedings before any other authority should lie.
13. The High Court would dispose of these cases as expeditiously as possible within a period of three
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) months. In case, as per its procedure, the writ
petition/miscellaneous petition/matter is disposed of by a Single Judge, then no further appeal
would lie against that order to the Division Bench but subject to special leave under Article 136.
14. In case, the certificate obtained or social status claimed is found to be false, the
parent/guardian/the candidate should be prosecuted for making false claim. If the prosecution ends
in a conviction and sentence of the accused, it could be regarded as an offence involving moral
turpitude, disqualification for elective posts or offices under the State or the Union or elections to
any local body, legislature or Parliament.
15. As soon as the finding is recorded by the Scrutiny Committee holding that the certificate
obtained was false, on its cancellation and confiscation simultaneously, it should be communicated
to the educational institution concerned or the appointing authority by registered post with
acknowledgement due with a request to cancel the admission or the appointment. The Principal etc.
of the educational institution responsible for making the admission or the appointing authority,
should cancel the admission/appointment without any further notice to the candidate and debar the
candidate from further study or continue in office in a post."
47. Accordingly, a High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee has been constituted and by circular dated
8-9-1997, procedure, to be adopted by the Committee, has also been provided which reads as under

48. It is submitted that the Committee was required to issue notice by registered post and at least 15
days time should be given to file reply. It is further submitted that the Committee is under obligation
to follow the procedure for service of notice, as provided under Order 5 of C.P.C. Further, there is
nothing on record to suggest that the notice were served upon the petitioner. On the contrary, there
is a specific report by the Collector, that on both the occasions, the petitioner was not available
therefore, the notice could not be personally served upon him. Further, it is submitted that neither
any SMS was sent to the petitioner, nor any notice was uploaded on his Facebook account. It is
further submitted that (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) the newspaper cuttings as relied
upon by the respondent cannot be considered, as no notice was published in the newspaper, but
merely a news was published with regard to the attempts made by the authorities to serve the
petitioner.
49. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner.
50. Section 141 of C.P.C. reads as under :
"141. Miscellaneous proceedings.-- The procedure provided in this Code in regard to
suits shall be followed, as far as it can be made applicable, in all proceedings in any
court of civil jurisdiction. Explanation.-- In this section, the expression "proceedings"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 25
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
includes proceedings under Order IX, but does not include any proceeding under
Article 226 of the Constitution."
51. The High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee has been constituted in pursuance to the order
passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Madhuri Patil (supra). By circular dated 8-9-1997, a
detailed procedure, to be followed by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, has also been laid
down. Thus, in the considered opinion of this Court, under these circumstances, the High Power
Caste Scrutiny Committee is not required to follow the provisions of Order 5 of CPC.
52. It is next contended by the Counsel for the Petitioner, that as per the circular dated 8-9-1997, the
Committee was required to send the notice by registered post, however, in the present case, they
were sent for service by humdust, and thus, the procedure adopted by the Committee was not in
accordance with the procedure laid down in the circular dated 8-9-1997.
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
53. The submission made by the Counsel for the Petitioner, cannot be accepted. It is clear from
circular dated 8-9-1997, that the notice by registered post has to be sent through head of the
institution, whereas it is not the case of the Petitioner, that at the relevant time, he was holding any
post. Further, in the circular dated 8-9-1997 itself, it is mentioned that where the candidate is a
minor, then the notice shall be issued to his parents/guardian, however, no mode of service of notice
has been provided in clause 4 of the procedure laid down in the circular dated 8-9- 1997. Thus, this
Court is of the considered opinion, that if the Committee had sent the notice, to be served humdast
on the petitioner, then the said procedure cannot be said to be defective or bad in law.
54. The next question for determination is that whether the petitioner was avoiding the service of
notice or not?
55. According to the impugned order dated 16-9-2013, it appears that by order dated 6-8-2013, the
High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee issued notices to the petitioner, for his appearance on
12-8-2013. It was reported by the Collector Guna, that the Sub Divisional Officer was sent to the
house of the petitioner, for service of notice, however, he was not in the house. The copy of the
report given by the S.D.O. was also annexed with the report of the Collector, from which it appears
that the Sub-Divisional Officer, Guna received the copy of the notices on 8-8- 2013 and accordingly,
he went to the house of the petitioner, but he was not found in the house, and the family members
informed the S.D.O., that the petitioner would be available on the next day. On 9-8-2013, when the
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) SDO again went to the house of the petitioner, then again
he was not available in the house. Again on 10-8-2013, no one was found in the house, accordingly,
the notice could not be served personally on the petitioner. Thereafter, the notice was read over to
the relatives and neighbours and they were requested to inform the petitioner. One copy of the
notice was affixed on the house and the signatures of the neighbourers were obtained. The entire
proceedings were got videographed. SMS was sent on the mobile of the petitioner and news was also
uploaded on the Facebook account of the petitioner. News was also published in the local print and
electronic media. However, on 12-8-2013, the petitioner did not appear before the High Power Caste
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 26
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Scrutiny Committee. Seven complainants appeared against the petitioner, and therefore, their
statements were recorded.
56. However, in order to give another opportunity of hearing, the High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee, decided to issue fresh notice to the petitioner and accordingly, fresh notice was issued
on 7-9-2013 for service of the same through Collector, Guna, for his appearance on 16-9- 2013.
Again the Collector, Guna by his report dated 13-9-2013 informed that the notice was received by
him on 12-9-2013. He and Tahsildar, Ashoknagar tried to contact the petitioner, but he was not
available. Three attempts were made to serve the notice but every time, they could not be served as
the house was locked. Accordingly, the notice was read over to his relatives and neighbourers, and
request was made to inform the petitioner. A copy of the notice was affixed on the house of the
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) petitioner and Panchnama was prepared. The entire
efforts were videographed. SMS was also sent on the mobile phone of the petitioner and news was
also uploaded on the Facebook account of the petitioner. Public notice was also given by beat of
drums and news was also published in the newspaper. On 16-9-2013 also, the Petitioner did not
appear before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee. Thus, it is clear that all efforts were made
by the authorities to serve the petitioner, however, he managed to avoid the service of notice. A news
was also published in the news papers, thus, it is clear that the petitioner had deliberately avoided
the service of notice in spite of all the efforts made by the authorities, and thus, the news published
in the newspaper can be said to be service by substituted service by publication.
57. However, another important question which requires consideration is that even when this Court
has come to a conclusion that the petitioner had avoided the service of notice and the news
published in the newspaper can be said to be a service by substituted service of publication, then
whether the Committee could have proceeded ex parte against the petitioner?
58. From the impugned order dated 16-9-2013, it is clear that on two occasions, notices were issued
to the petitioner i.e., firstly on 6-8-2013 and secondly on 7-9-2013. While issuing notice on
6-8-2013, the Committee had fixed the date of appearance as 12-8-2013 and while issuing notice on
7-9-2013, the date of appearance of the petitioner was fixed as 16-9-2013. Circular dated 8-9-1997
provides that by issuing (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) notice to the candidate, 15 days
time should be given from the date of receipt of notice. In the present case, on both the occasions,
the date of appearance was fixed prior to expiry of 15 days time. Thus, this Court is of the considered
opinion, that although the notices are treated to be served on the petitioner, but still they were bad
in law, as the minimum stipulated time was not given to the petitioner, and thus the right of the
petitioner to respond to the notices was violated.
59. Now the next question for determination is that when sufficient time was not granted to the
petitioner, and the petitioner also did not appear before the Committee and did not pray for time to
file reply, then whether the proceedings of the Committee can be said to be vitiated or not?
60. It is submitted by the Counsel for the respondents, that when the petitioner was served with the
notice, even then he did not appear before the Committee and did not pray for time, therefore, the
proceedings before the Committee would not stand vitiated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 27
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
61. Per contra, it is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner, that when the notice itself was per se
illegal, then non-appearance of the petitioner would not validate the proceedings of the Committee.
62. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the parties.
63. Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C reads as under :
"13. Setting aside decree ex parte against defendant.-- In any case in which a decree is
passed ex parte against a defendant, he may apply to the Court by which the decree
was passed for an order to set it aside; and if he satisfies the Court that the summons
was not duly served, or that he was (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called on for
hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the decree as against him upon
such terms as to costs, payment into Court or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall
appoint a day for proceeding with the suit:
Provided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be set aside as
against such defendant only it may be set aside as against all or any of the other
defendants also:
Provided further that no Court shall set aside a decree passed ex parte merely on the
ground that there has been an irregularity in the service of summons, if it is satisfied
that the defendant had notice of the date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear
and answer the plaintiff's claim.
Explanation.-- Where there has been an appeal against a decree passed ex parte
under this rule, and the appeal has been disposed of on any ground other than the
ground that the appellant has withdrawn the appeal, no application shall lie under
this rule for setting aside that ex parte decree."
Thus, it is clear that mere irregularity in the service of notice/summons shall not be a ground to set
aside an ex parte decree. However, the knowledge of pendency of the suit is not sufficient to attract
2nd proviso to Order 9 Rule 13 C.P.C., but the knowledge of the date of hearing is important. The
Supreme Court in the case of Sushil Kumar Sabharwal Vs. Gurpreet Singh reported in (2002)5 SCC
377 has held as under :
"11. The High Court has overlooked the second proviso to Rule 13 of Order 9 CPC,
added by the 1976 Amendment which provides that no court shall set aside a decree
passed ex parte merely on the ground that there has been an irregularity in the
service of summons if it is satisfied that the defendant had notice of the date of
hearing and had sufficient time to appear and answer the plaintiff's claim. It is the
knowledge of the "date of hearing" and not the knowledge of "pendency of suit"
which is relevant (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) for the purpose of the
proviso abovesaid. Then the present one is not a case of mere irregularity in service of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 28
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
summons; on the facts it is a case of non- service of summons. The appellant has
appeared in the witness box and we have carefully perused his statement. There is no
cross-examination directed towards discrediting the testimony on oath of the
appellant, that is, to draw an inference that the appellant had in any manner a notice
of the date of hearing and had sufficient time to appear and answer the plaintiff's
claim which he did not avail and utilise."
64. In the impugned order dated 16-9-2013, it has not been held that the petitioner had any
knowledge of date of hearing and in spite of that he has not appeared. It is submitted that the
respondents have filed the copy of the newspapers as Annexure R/8 to show that it was mentioned
in the news that the next date of hearing was 12-8-2013, but thereafter, the Committee itself had
decided to give one more opportunity to the petitioner and accordingly, fresh notice was issued.
According to the impugned order dated 16-9-2013, news was once again published in the
newspaper, but the respondents have not placed the said newspapers on record. It is further
submitted that in spite of the repeated opportunities, the respondents have not produced the
original record of the proceedings of the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, therefore, an
adverse inference has to be drawn, and it has to be held that no date of hearing was mentioned in
the newspaper. Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the petitioner and perused the
record. The record of the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee was made available before this
Court on 6-12-2018, but since, the same was not complete, therefore, the case was adjourned. On
12-3-2019, the entire record of the High Power (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) Caste
Scrutiny Committee was available (as is evident from the order dated 12-3-2019), but when the case
was fixed for hearing, then on 22-4- 2019, the record of the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee
was not produced, and a specific direction was also given to the respondents to keep the original
record available on 25-4-2019, however, again on 25-4- 2019, the respondents did not produce the
record. Why the record was sent back specifically when it was available on 12-3-2019 has also not
been explained by the Counsel for the respondents. Why the record has not been called in spite of
the specific order by this Court on 22-4-2019 has also not been clarified by the State Counsel. It
appears that for any reason best known to the respondents, they are now deliberately avoiding to
produce the record.
65. Be that whatever it may.
66. The crux of the matter is that the record of the Committee is not before the Court, and under
these circumstances, this Court has no option but to hold that the petitioner was not aware that
16-9-2013 is the date of hearing before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee.
67. Now, the question for determination is that whether any prejudice has been caused to the
Petitioner because of ex parte order or not?
68. It is well established principle of law that violation of Natural Justice, by itself would not be
sufficient to quash an order, unless and until, the person is prejudiced by denial of opportunity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 29
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
69. The Supreme Court in the case of Dharampal Satyapal Ltd. Vs. CCE reported in (2015)8 SCC 519
has held as under :
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) "40. In this behalf, we need to notice one
other exception which has been carved out to the aforesaid principle by the courts.
Even if it is found by the court that there is a violation of principles of natural justice,
the courts have held that it may not be necessary to strike down the action and refer
the matter back to the authorities to take fresh decision after complying with the
procedural requirement in those cases where non-grant of hearing has not caused
any prejudice to the person against whom the action is taken. Therefore, every
violation of a facet of natural justice may not lead to the conclusion that the order
passed is always null and void. The validity of the order has to be decided on the
touchstone of "prejudice". The ultimate test is always the same viz.
the test of prejudice or the test of fair hearing.
* * * *
45. Keeping in view the aforesaid principles in mind, even when we find that there is an infraction of
principles of natural justice, we have to address a further question as to whether any purpose would
be served in remitting the case to the authority to make fresh demand of amount recoverable, only
after issuing notice to show cause to the appellant. In the facts of the present case, we find that such
an exercise would be totally futile having regard to the law laid down by this Court in R.C. Tobacco."
The Supreme Court in the case of Ashok Kumar Sonkar v. Union of India reported in (2007) 4 SCC
54 has held as under :
"26. This brings us to the question as to whether the principles of natural justice were
required to be complied with. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the audi
alteram partem is one of the basic pillars of natural justice which means no one
should be condemned unheard. However, whenever possible the principle of natural
justice should be followed. Ordinarily in a case of this nature the same should be
complied with. Visitor may in a given situation issue notice to the employee who
would be effected by the ultimate order that may be passed. He may not be given an
oral hearing, but may be allowed to make a representation in writing.
27. It is also, however, well settled that it cannot put (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P.
and others) any straitjacket formula. It may not be applied in a given case unless a
prejudice is shown. It is not necessary where it would be a futile exercise.
28. A court of law does not insist on compliance with useless formality. It will not
issue any such direction where the result would remain the same, in view of the fact
situation prevailing or in terms of the legal consequences. Furthermore in this case,
the selection of the appellant was illegal. He was not qualified on the cut-off date.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 30
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Being ineligible to be considered for appointment, it would have been a futile exercise
to give him an opportunity of being heard.
29. In Aligarh Muslim University v. Mansoor Ali Khan the law is stated in the
following terms: (SCC p. 540, para 25) "25. The 'useless formality' theory, it must be
noted, is an exception. Apart from the class of cases of 'admitted or indisputable facts
leading only to one conclusion' referred to above, there has been considerable debate
on the application of that theory in other cases. The divergent views expressed in
regard to this theory have been elaborately considered by this Court in M.C. Mehta
referred to above. This Court surveyed the views expressed in various judgments in
England by Lord Reid, Lord Wilberforce, Lord Woolf, Lord Bingham, Megarry, J. and
Straughton, L.J. etc. in various cases and also views expressed by leading writers like
Profs. Garner, Craig, de Smith, Wade, D.H. Clark etc. Some of them have said that
orders passed in violation must always be quashed for otherwise the court will be
prejudging the issue. Some others have said that there is no such absolute rule and
prejudice must be shown. Yet, some others have applied via media rules. We do not
think it necessary in this case to go deeper into these issues. In the ultimate analysis,
it may depend on the facts of a particular case."
30. In Karnataka SRTC v. S.G. Kotturappa this Court held: (SCC p. 420, para 24) "The question as to
what extent, principles of natural justice are required to be complied with would depend upon the
fact situation obtaining in each case. The principles of natural justice cannot be applied in vacuum.
They cannot be (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) put in any straitjacket formula. The
principles of natural justice are furthermore not required to be complied with when it will lead to an
empty formality. What is needed for the employer in a case of this nature is to apply the objective
criteria for arriving at the subjective satisfaction. If the criteria required for arriving at an objective
satisfaction stands fulfilled, the principles of natural justice may not have to be complied with, in
view of the fact that the same stood complied with before imposing punishments upon the
respondents on each occasion and, thus, the respondents, therefore, could not have improved their
stand even if a further opportunity was given."
31. In Punjab National Bank v. Manjeet Singh this Court opined: (SCC pp. 653-54, para 17) "The
principles of natural justice were also not required to be complied with as the same would have been
an empty formality. The court will not insist on compliance with the principles of natural justice in
view of the binding nature of the award. Their application would be limited to a situation where the
factual position or legal implication arising thereunder is disputed and not where it is not in dispute
or cannot be disputed. If only one conclusion is possible, a writ would not issue only because there
was a violation of the principles of natural justice."
32. In P.D. Agrawal v. State Bank of India this Court observed: (SCC p. 791, para 30) "30. The
principles of natural justice cannot be put in a straitjacket formula. It must be seen in circumstantial
flexibility. It has separate facets. It has in recent time also undergone a sea change."
It was further observed: (SCC pp. 793-94, para 39) "39. Decision of this Court in S.L. Kapoor v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 31
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
Jagmohan whereupon Mr Rao placed strong reliance to contend that non-observance of the
principles of natural justice itself causes prejudice or the same should not be read 'as it causes
difficulty of prejudice', cannot be said to be applicable in the instant case. The principles of natural
justice, as noticed hereinbefore, have undergone a sea change. In view of the decisions of this Court
in State Bank of Patiala (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) v. S.K. Sharma and Rajendra
Singh v. State of M.P. the principle of law is that some real prejudice must have been caused to the
complainant. The Court has shifted from its earlier concept that even a small violation shall result in
the order being rendered a nullity. To the principle/doctrine of audi alteram partem, a clear
distinction has been laid down between the cases where there was no hearing at all and the cases
where there was mere technical infringement of the principle. The Court applies the principles of
natural justice having regard to the fact situation obtaining in each case. It is not applied in a
vacuum without reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the case. It is no unruly horse.
It cannot be put in a straitjacket formula. (See Viveka Nand Sethi v. Chairman, J&K Bank Ltd. and
State of U.P. v. Neeraj Awasthi. See also Mohd. Sartaj v. State of U.P.)"
The principles of equity in a case of this nature, in our opinion, will have no role to
play. Sympathy, as is well known, should not be misplaced.
33. In Maruti Udyog Ltd. v. Ram Lal a Division Bench of this Court, wherein one of
us was a member, noticing some decisions, observed: (SCC pp. 654-55, paras 44-45)
"44. While construing a statute, 'sympathy' has no role to play. This Court cannot
interpret the provisions of the said Act ignoring the binding decisions of the
Constitution Bench of this Court only by way of sympathy to the workmen concerned.
45. In A. Umarani v. Registrar, Coop. Societies this Court rejected a similar
contention upon noticing the following judgments: (SCC pp. 131-32, paras 68-70) '68.
In a case of this nature this Court should not even exercise its jurisdiction under
Article 142 of the Constitution of India on misplaced sympathy.
69. In Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. U.T., Chandigarh it is stated: (SCC p. 144, paras 36-
37) "36. We have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot
be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to
establish a legal right. It is further trite that despite an extraordinary constitutional
jurisdiction contained in Article 142 of the Constitution of India, this Court (Jaipal
Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) ordinarily would not pass an order which would
be in contravention of a statutory provision.
37. As early as in 1911, Farewell, L.J. in Latham v. Richard Johnson & Nephew Ltd.
observed:
(All ER p. 123 E) 'We must be very careful not to allow our sympathy with the infant
plaintiff to affect our judgment. Sentiment is a dangerous will o' the wisp to take as a
guide in the search for legal principles.' "

Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
70. Yet again, recently in Ramakrishna Kamat v. State of Karnataka this Court rejected a similar plea
for regularisation of services stating: (SCC pp. 377- 78, para 7) "We repeatedly asked the learned
counsel for the appellants on what basis or foundation in law the appellants made their claim for
regularisation and under what rules their recruitment was made so as to govern their service
conditions. They were not in a position to answer except saying that the appellants have been
working for quite some time in various schools started pursuant to resolutions passed by Zila
Parishads in view of the government orders and that their cases need to be considered
sympathetically. It is clear from the order of the learned Single Judge and looking to the very
directions given, a very sympathetic view was taken. We do not find it either just or proper to show
any further sympathy in the given facts and circumstances of the case. While being sympathetic to
the persons who come before the court the courts cannot at the same time be unsympathetic to the
large number of eligible persons waiting for a long time in a long queue seeking employment." ' "
34. It is not a case where appointment was irregular. If an appointment is irregular,
the same can be regularised. The court may not take serious note of an irregularity
within the meaning of the provisions of the Act. But if an appointment is illegal, it is
non est in the eye of the law, which renders the appointment to be a nullity.
35. We have noticed hereinbefore that in making appointment of the appellant, the
provisions of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution and statutory rules were not
complied with. The appointment, (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
therefore, was illegal and in that view of the matter, it would be wholly improper for
us to invoke our equity jurisdiction."
70. Thus, in order to find out that whether any prejudice has been caused to the petitioner or not,
few questions were put by the Court, to the Counsel for the Petitioner, out of which some of them are
as under :
1. Whether the petitioner ever contested any election for the post of Member Janpad
Panchayat in the year 1994, as a "General Category Candidate" or not and whether he
was elected or not?
2. Whether in the year 1999, the petitioner had contested the election for the post of
Member Zila Panchayat as a candidate of "Scheduled Caste" or not and when the
certificate of "Scheduled Caste" was obtained by him?
3. Whether the petitioner had contested the election for the post of President,
Municipal Council Ashoknagar as a candidate of "OBC" and under what
circumstances, the "OBC"
certificate dated 2-12-1999 was issued to him and what happened to his earlier certificate of "SC"?
4. Why the certificate of "OBC" was obtained by the petitioner, just few days prior to the elections
for the post of President, Municipal Council, Ashoknagar?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 33
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
5. Whether any certificate of "SC" was ever issued in favour of the petitioner prior to 6-11-2008 and
if so, then on what date, and when the said certificate was surrendered by him and why?
6. Why the petitioner did not obtain the "SC" certificate from 11-11-2004 ("OBC" certificate was
cancelled by order dated 11-11-2004 by the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee) till 6-11-2008?
7. The election for M.P. State Legislative Assembly were held (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and
others) on 27-11-2008, then why the petitioner had obtained his "SC" certificate just prior to holding
of election ?
8. Why the petitioner was obtaining different caste certificates, just few days prior to the elections?
9. Whether the surname of the petitioner has been recorded in some of the documents as "Sandhu"
or not?
10. If the earlier "SC" certificate was still in force, then why the petitioner obtained a fresh "SC"
certificate on 6-11-2008?
71. The questions pertaining to obtaining Caste Certificates just prior to the elections are necessary
in the light of the findings given by the Previous High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, and the
Collector, Guna that the petitioner is in habit of obtaining Caste Certificate for his political
advantages.
72. In reply, it is submitted by the Counsel for the petitioner, that this petition has been filed by the
petitioner challenging the order dated 16-9- 2013 and to the above mentioned questions put by the
Court, there is no reply in the writ petition. However, it is submitted that in case the petitioner is
granted an opportunity before the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, then he shall give answer
to all the above mentioned questions. Thus, it is clear that serious questions which have arisen
against the petitioner, have remained unanswered. This Court feels that in view of Direction 13.14
given by the Supreme Court in the case of Madhuri Patil (Supra), the petitioner may face penal
consequences, therefore, it would be appropriate not to deny an opportunity to the petitioner to
answer all the serious questions, including the above mentioned.
(Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others)
73. Thus, even by holding that the petitioner had avoided the service of notices issued by the High
Power Caste Scrutiny Committee and the paper publication was sufficient to hold that the petitioner
was served by substituted service by publication, but as the petitioner was not aware of the date of
hearing, and considering the fact, that the petitioner may suffer penal consequences, the matter is
remanded back to the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee for adjudication of the Caste
Certificate of "SC" dated 6-11-2008, afresh. The High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee is directed to
decide the matter afresh after issuing notice to the petitioner as prescribed under the guidelines.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/6482202/ 34
Jaipal Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 1 May, 2019
74. By way of abundant caution, the High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee is directed not to get
prejudiced by any of the observations made by this Court, in this order, and the matter should be
decided strictly in accordance with the evidence which would come on record.
75. Now the next question for determination is that while remanding the matter back to the High
Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, whether this Court should quash the order dated 16-9-2013,
resulting in automatic revival of "SC" Certificate or not?
76. Once, this Court has come to a conclusion that the matter deserves to be remanded back to the
High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee, then it has no option but to quash the order dated
16-9-2013.
77. However, as the petitioner has failed to answer the questions put by this Court so as to find out
that whether any prejudice was caused to the petitioner or not, therefore, while remanding the
matter back to the (Jaipal Singh Vs. State of M.P. and others) High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee, this Court does not find it appropriate to restore back the "SC" Certificate dated
6-11-2008.
78. Accordingly, it is directed that till the decision is taken by the High Power Caste Scrutiny
Committee, the "SC" certificate dated 6-11-2008 (Annexure P/7) issued in favour of the petitioner,
shall remain in abeyance and the petitioner shall not be entitled to take advantage of the same.
79. The High Power Caste Scrutiny Committee is directed, that in case, it comes to a conclusion that
the petitioner has wrongly obtained the "SC" certificate dated 6-11-2008, then it shall take further
action as per the directions, including direction No.13.14, given by the Supreme Court in the case of
Madhuri Patil (Supra).
80. With aforesaid observations, the petition is finally disposed of.
