. The brief facts which led to the filing of this case Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018
dt.01-03-2019 is that:-
A) The petitioner having passed the Bihar Madhyama Sanskrit Shiksha Board made
an application for the post of Secretary, Gram Kutchery which is constituted by the
State Government in the exercise of power under Section 94(2), read with Section 146
of the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act, 2006. The Rules for the same were framed for Gram
Kutchery Sachiv Niyojan Seva Shart Evam Kartavya Niyamavali, 2007 (hereinafter
referred to as the 'Rules').
B) The petitioner's application was examined by the Block Development Officer who
inquired from the District Magistrate regarding the validity of the qualification of
Madhyama. The District Magistrate, in turn, inquired from the Director, Panchayati
Raj as to whether the candidates who were possessing the Madhyama examination
from the Sanskrit Shiksha Board could be considered as matriculate for the purpose
of appointment on the post of Secretary, Gram Kutchery.
C) The Director, Panchayati Raj vide Letter No. 4808 dated 10.10.2007 clarified that
Clause 5(a) of the said Rules provide that only a Matriculate can be considered for the
purpose of Secretary, Gram Kutchery.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 D) Thus, the candidature of the
appellant/petitioner, though she was placed at serial No. 1 of the panel prepared by the Gram
Panchayat for consideration to the post of Secretary, Gram Kutchery was rejected on the solitary
ground that she was disqualified as she possessed the certificate of Madhyama which cannnot be
treated at par with matriculation.
E) This led the appellant/petitioner to file C.W.J.C. No. 15636 of 2007 which was disposed of by an
order dated 10.03.2010 wherein it was noted that the issue had already been decided in C.W.J.C.
No. 13905 of 2007, holding that the qualification of Madhyama was equivalent to that of
Matriculation. As such, the Court disposed of the writ application with a direction to the
respondents to dispose of her representation by means of a reasoned order in the light of the
judgment in C.W.J.C. No. 13905 of 2007.
F) In pursuance of the orders filed by the appellant Kanti Kumari, before the competent authority
the appointment of Binod Kumar Yadav, respondent No. 7 herein, was disturbed and therefore he
preferred a writ application bearing C.W.J.C. No. 18123 of 2009 (Binod Kumar Yadav vs. The State
of Bihar & Ors.) wherein this Court after considering the entire facts and circumstances passed
orders in the following terms:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96953213/ 2
Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
"It appears that the issue of retrospective effect to Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of
2018 dt.01-03-2019 legislative amendment by executive orders and whether it be
permissible has already been considered by this Court in C.W.J.C. No. 6762 of 2009
and analogous cases in context of the very same controversy."
3. It is important to indicate here that in another writ application bearing C.W.J.C. No. 6762 of
2009, this Court had declared the law in this regard with reference to the decision in C.W.J.C. No.
13905 of 2007. The said C.W.J.C. No. 13905 of 2007 was preferred by one Santosh Kumar Pandey,
similarly aggrieved by denial of appointment for the reason of his Madhyama qualification. This
Court on 31.01.2008, relying upon a Government Policy Decision dated 11.01.1999, held that
Madhyama was equivalent to matriculation and directed consideration of his case accordingly.
Pursuant to the aforementioned pronouncement, the State Legislature made a legislative
amendment to Rule 5 of the aforementioned Rules inserting the word "or equivalent" after
Matriculation. The amendment was notified on 05.01.2009 with retrospective effect from
31.01.2008. It is important to indicate here that Rule 1(3) of the Amendment Act contained a saving
clause preserving appointments made prior to 31.01.2008.
4. In another writ application bearing C.W.J.C. No. Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018
dt.01-03-2019 1791 of 2010, vide order dated 30.08.2010, this court categorically held as under:-
"It is a settled law that a legislative amendment cannot be given further retrospective
effect by any executive orders. If the Legislature in its wisdom thought it fit to fix a
cut-off date as 31.1.2008 and which this Court considers extremely reasonable based
on the date of pronouncement by the Court, no executive order can make
"Madhyama" an acceptable qualification for appointment on the post of Secretary
prior to 31.1.2008. Any direction to consider for appointment persons who applied on
basis of "Madhyama" qualification prior to 31.1.2008 by invoking the legislative
amendment is completely contrary to law.
In view of the saving clause contained in the amendment notified on 5.1.2009, the
appointment of the petitioners in C.W.J.C. No.5274/10 and 594/10 having been
made much prior to 31.1.2008 stands saved by the amendment itself. Insofar as the
appointment of the petitioner in C.W.J.C. No.1791/10 is concerned, the appointment
letter having been issued on 29.1.2008 and she having joined within time granted for
such appointment, the same dates back to 29.1.2008 and any joining on 31.1.2008 by
her is clearly fortuitous and does not put her in a category different from the other
two petitioners. This Court therefore holds that the ouster of the petitioners to
accommodate the private respondents cannot be sustained in law. The legislative
amendment has to be given its true and legal effect only from 31.1.2008. There can be
no deemed retrospective effect to a legislative Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of
2018 dt.01-03-2019 amendment by an executive order."
5. For a clearer perspective, it would be appropriate to take quick glance through the notification
dated 05.01.2009 by which the Rules Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006 was amended as the Secretary,

Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
Bihar Gram Kutchery (Employment, Service Conditions and Duties) Rule, 2007 dated 05.01.2009
which is extracted hereinbelow:-
"The 5th January 2009 No. 2P/V6-102/2007/PR/28-In exercise of powers conferred
by Section-146 read with Section - 94(1) of the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006 (Bihar
Act 6, 2006), the Governor of Bihar amends the Secretary, Bihar Gram Kutchahry
(Employment, Service Conditions and Duties) Rule, 2007 as under:-
1. Short title, extent and commencement.- (1) These rules may be called the Secretary,
Bihar Gram Kutchahry (Employment, Service Conditions and Duties) (Amendment)
Rule, 2008.
(2) It shall extend to the whole of Bihar State. (3) It shall come into force w.e.f. 31.01.2008. The
appointments made prior to this date under the Secretary, Bihar Gram Kutchahry (Employment,
Service Conditions and Duties) Rule, 2007 shall not have any effect of this amendment.
2. In sub-rule 5(a)(ii) after the words "Secondary (Matriculate) "the words" or the certificate
declared equivalent to the aforesaid certificate by the State Government from time to time" shall be
inserted.
By order of the Governor of Bihar, Sd/-Illegible, Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018
dt.01-03-2019 Principal Secretary to the Government"
6. It appears that a challenge was placed to the amendments made in Rule 5(a)(ii) of
the Secretary, Bihar Gram Kutchery (Employment, Service Conditions and Duties)
Rule, 2007 dated 05.01.2009, which was heard by a Division Bench in C.W.J.C. No.
1996 of 2010 (Kiran Kumari & Ors. Vs. the State of Bihar & Ors.) wherein the
aforesaid Rules were held to be intra vires Article 14 and 16 of the Constitution of
India. The Court held in the following terms:-
"We see no substance in the argument advanced by Mr. Pandey. As we have noted
earlier the extant Rule 5(ka) (2) did not envisage any qualification other than
matriculation; not even an equivalent qualification. The impugned Notification dated
5th January 2009 amends the said Rule effective from 31st January 2008, i.e.
effective from 31st January 2008, not only the matriculates but also candidates
possessing equivalent qualification have been made eligible for appointment as the
Secretary of the Gram Kutchery. What should be the date from which the Rule should
be made effective is a matter of policy. This Court exercising power of judicial review
will not interfere with the policy decision of the State.
7. An extract of the order passed in C.W.J.C. No. 6762 of 2009 is quoted
hereinunder:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96953213/ 4
Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
"A person who possessed the qualification Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018
dt.01-03-2019 of "Madhyama" appears to have come to this Court in C.W.J.C.
No.13905 of 2007 claiming that it was equivalent to "Matriculation" under a
government decision dated 11.1.1999, aggrieved by his non- consideration for lack of
eligibility which was allowed on 31.1.2008. In pursuance thereof, the State
Government in the Department of Panchayat Raj under the pen of the Governor
amended the Gram Kachahary Rules on 5.1.2009 with effect from 31.1.2008
accepting Madhyama as an equivalent qualification to Matriculation for appointment
as Gram Kachahary Secretary. Pursuant to the Amendment of the Rules on 5.1.2009
with effect from 31.1.2008 consequent to certain orders of this Court, the Secretary,
Department of Panchayat Raj issued orders on 6.1.2009 by giving directions for
cancellation of all appointments even prior to 31.1.2008 and directing fresh
appointment after redrawing the merit list with consideration of those holding
Madhyma qualification also. In pursuance thereof has followed the termination
orders of the petitioners dated 20.6.2009.
The Respondents have chosen not to file a counter affidavit. This Court is not
persuaded to hold up the proceeding for that reason in view of the nature of the order
to be passed hereinafter.
The issue in C.W.J.C.No. 13905 of 2007 did not concern appointments already made
and the Court made no pronouncements in respect of the same.
Prima facie this Court finds substance in the submission on behalf of the petitioners
that the termination of their services by an executive fiat contrary to statutory rules is
not sustainable. If the Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019
statutory Rules make the effective date fixed 31.1.2008, it cannot be shifted by any
executive orders. This Court, therefore, directs that the impugned orders of
termination shall be kept in abeyance till determination in the manner hereinafter
directed.
Since the writ applications are being disposed without a counter affidavit, in fairness
to the Respondents, this Court directs the Principal Secretary, Department of
Panchayat Raj to re-decide the issue of termination of the petitioners in light of the
aforesaid discussion that executive orders cannot override statutory rules and pass a
reasoned and speaking order in accordance with law within a maximum period of
three weeks from the date of receipt/production of a copy of this order.
The order of termination shall abide by such final orders to be passed by the Principal
Secretary, Department of Panchayat Raj.
The writ application stands disposed."

8. In the light of the aforementioned pronouncements which includes judgments both prior and post
amendment, the contention of the State was clear that this Hon'ble Court had settled the law
inasmuch as it had been made clear that any appointment made on the basis of Madhyama
qualification prior to 31.01.2008, if any, is not valid and legal in view of the provisions of the
Secretary, Bihar Gram Kutchery (Employment, Service Conditions and Duties) (Amendment) Rule,
2008.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019
9. The respondent-State of Bihar has filed a counter affidavit contesting and opposing the
appellant's claim. It has been submitted that so far as the appellant Kanti Kumari is concerned, the
respondent has contended that the Appellant was a Madhyama qualified and had challenged the
order of appointment of the respondent No. 7 before this Court which pertained to his appointment
done prior to 31.01.2008, on which date, matriculation was the sole qualification. The case of the
respondent vis-a-vis the appellant stood settled in view of the judgment delivered in C.W.J.C. No.
6762 of 2009 (Mahabir Choudhary Vs. State of Bihar) and also the Division Bench vide order dated
05.04.2011 passed in C.W.J.C. No. 1996 of 2010 (Kiran Kumari and Ors. vs. The State of Bihar). It
was also contended by the respondent-State that the current scenario has changed and the Rules,
2007 has been repealed and replaced by the Secretary, Bihar Gram Kutchery (Employment, Service
Conditions and Duties) Rule, 2014, with effect from date of its Notification i.e. 05.01.2015. In the
said Rules, the minimum educational eligibility qualification under Rule 5(1) of the Rules, 2014 has
been written as Intermediate(10+2) or equivalent qualification by the State Government and thus
the appellant's claim is devoid of any merit.
Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019
10. In the counter affidavit filed by the respondent No. 7 who was a candidate for the same set of
advertisement as the appellant, it was contended that while respondent No. 7 was having a requisite
qualification of Matriculation, he applied on 09.08.2007 and counselling was done on 25.09.2007.
After exhausting all processes in the meeting dated 16.01.2008 held by the Employment Committee,
one Nand Kishore was selected and granted ten days time to join, but the said Nand Kishore
submitted his written refusal for joining on 21.01.2008 and as a consequence thereof the respondent
No.7, being the next applicant from the merit-list was informed about the appointment on
28.01.2008. On the said date, i.e. 28.01.2008 he got his appointment letter which finds place at
Annexure-C of the counter affidavit. Respondent No.7 further alleged that the appellant got the
recital made in the proceeding book dated 28.01.2008 manipulated and in the last line of the date
"28.01.2008", the letter '2' of '28' had been made '0' whereas the month '1' had been converted into
'2'. It is important to mention that the signature of the Sarpanch however, remains to be
"28.01.2008" in the proceeding book as appended at Annexure-4 of the writ petition. The
manipulated version of the aforementioned proceeding book has been brought on record as Patna
High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 Annexure-A and A/1 of the counter affidavit. The
aforementioned annexures have been brought on record after obtaining them under the Right to
Information Act, 2005. The fact that the petitioner was appointed on 28.01.2008, is also explicit
from Annexure-E which is memo No. 5 dated 31.08.2012 written by the then Sarpanch, Gram

Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
Kutchery Mahmada, District-Saran by which it had been reported to the Block Development Officer,
Garkha, Saran that the petitioner was appointed on 28.01.2008. An extract of the letter from the
office of the Gram Kutchery Mahmada, (Garkha) contained in memo No. 5 dated 31.08.2012 is
extracted hereinbelow:-

11. Learned counsel for respondent No. 7 further pointed out that the question of want of
qualification was never the case of anybody and vide order dated 03.11.2009 passed in C.W.J.C. No.
13839 of 2009 and C.W.J.C. No. 1791 of 2010, vide order dated 30.08.2010, it had been specifically
clarified that those appointed prior to the cut-off date fixed in Notification dated 05.01.2009 were
not to be disturbed but the order was categorically clear with regard to those possessing Madhyama
qualification. The fact of the same is reproduced hereunder:-
"Any direction to consider appointment for persons who applied on the basis of
"Madhyama"
qualification prior to 31.01.2008 by invoking the legislative amendment is completely contrary to
law."
12. It was thus submitted by the respondent No. 7, that the termination of respondent no.7 had been
kept in abeyance by virtue of the order passed in C.W.J.C. No. 18123 of 2009 (Binod Kumar Yadav
vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.) which was disposed of on 15.03.2010 to take a decision in his matter in
accordance with the directions of C.W.J.C. No. 6762 of 2009 and other analogous cases. The
termination of respondent no.7 Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 was to be
kept in abeyance which would merge in the final order to be passed by the Principal Secretary,
Department of Panchayati Raj, Bihar. However, no orders were passed pursuant to the direction
dated 15.03.2010 which led the respondent No. 7 to file M.J.C. No. 805 of 2011 and ultimately vide
memo no.3210 dated 27.04.2011 issued under the signature of the Principal Secretary, Department
of Panchayati Raj, Bihar, the District Magistrate, Saran, was directed to take action in respect of his
case. Thereafter, on 09.10.2010 vide Annexure-H, contained in memo No. 1421 the Block
Development Officer, Garkha informed the Sarpanch, Gram Kutchery, Mahmada, that in
compliance of the order passed by this Court, the appointment of Shri Binod Kumar Yadav was
being affirmed and also directed that his appointment be kept untouched and appropriate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/96953213/ 7
Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
instructions be issued accordingly. As such the Sarpanch convened a meeting dated 20.03.2011, in
which the appointment of the petitioner was approved unanimously (Annexure-I). It was thus urged
by the respondent no.7 that the issue must now be laid to rest as the appeal is wholly devoid of any
merit and the points of law formulated by the appellant are contrary to the settled principal of law
and also no relief can be granted in the prevailing facts and circumstances of the case. Patna High
Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019
13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials available on records.
The law with regard to the appointment to the appellant vis-a-vis that of the respondent No. 7 need
not be gone into in view of the various judicial pronouncements which have been brought to the
fore. The law laid down in the case of Kiran Kumari (supra) goes to settle and negate the claim of the
appellant and we are not persuaded to consider otherwise.
14. It being apparent that the matter now stands concluded by the Division Bench judgment decided
on 5 th April, 2011 in C.W.J.C. No.1996 of 2010 (Kiran Kumari and Ors. vs. The State of Bihar), the
only issue which needs to be resolved which has been raised by the appellant as a last bid effort to
salvage her case, is that the appellant has contended that the appointment of respondent No.7 was
made on 8 th February, 2008 and not 28.01.2008, which is beyond the cut-off date of 31.01.2008. It
was in view of such a contention raised by the appellants that we deemed it necessary to issue
notices to the respondent No. 7 who has appeared and filed counter affidavit.
15. We have considered in detail the series of events which led to the appointment of Respondent
No. 7 and the documents appended to the writ application filed by the Patna High Court L.P.A
No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 Respondent No. 7. There appears to be a clear interpolation in the
Proceeding Book. In this context, court this would have not gone into the disputed questions of facts
but for the availability of other corroborating documents/evidence appended to the counter affidvait
in the shape of the letters issued prior to the date of contest in this regard. It is clear from the
letter/proceeding (Annexure-A) written by the Sarpanch that one Nand Kishore was given an
appointment and granted ten days time to join and if he does not give his consent, the offer would
be made to the second candidate in the letter Annexure- A. It is stated in the aforementioned letter
that the said Nand Kishore had not given his consent rather, on 21.01.2008, he had expressed his
inability to join and thereafter respondent- petitioner Vinod Kumar Yadav was given an offer to join
within next ten days. This letter is dated 28.01.2008 (Annexure A/1). However, there appears to be a
cutting in the opening sentence of the Proceeding Book and thus that the appellant is claiming that
the appointment was made on 08.02.2008 and not on 28.01.2008. A document dated 28.01.2008
which is marked Annexure 'C' and 'D' is the joining letter of the respondent No. 7 on the same date
duly received by the Sarpanch of Gram Kutchery, Mahmada, Garkha, Saran, has also been brought
on Patna High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 record to demonstrate that the
petitioner's claim is far-fetched.
16. We have also considered Annexure-E dated 31.08.2012 duly signed by the Sarpanch of the
Mahmada. In the said letter the date of appointment of the respondent No. 7 was stated to be
28.01.2008. Thus any allegation with regard to interpolation in the date of appointment does not
stand substantiated and the benefit thereof would accrue in favour of respondent No. 7.

Kanti Kumari @ Kanti Devi vs The State Of Bihar And Ors on 1 March, 2019
17. The learned Single has thus rightly held that the writ petitioner was not eligible for being
appointed on the date of the application and subsequently by amendment of the Rule, she could not
be affected as the amendment of Rule 5 came into play only after it was notified on 05.01.2009. The
said amendment made it abundantly clear that it would have retrospective effect from 31.01.2008,
meaning thereby that the appointment made prior to 31.01.2008 were saved from being disturbed.
18. Furthermore, in our considered view, the appointment of respondent No. 7, who was possessing
the requisites qualifications of Matriculation at the time of the selection which began in 2007 cannot
be upset by the appellant as it was made on 28.01.2008 i.e., prior to the cut-off date fixed Patna
High Court L.P.A No.400 of 2018 dt.01-03-2019 by the Amendment. Thus, even on facts, the
appellant has no case in her favour.
19. For the aforementioned reasons and considering all aspects of the matter which includes the
proposition of law with reference to the particular facts and circumstance, we find that the appeal is
shorn of any merit and fit to be dismissed.
20. We direct accordingly. Consigned.
