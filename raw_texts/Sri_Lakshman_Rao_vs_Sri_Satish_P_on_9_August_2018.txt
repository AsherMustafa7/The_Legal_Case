JUDGMENT
Being aggrieved by the judgment and award dated 14.3.2016 passed by the MACT, Bengaluru
(SCCH-8) in MVC 3511/2014, the appellant-claimant has filed the present appeal seeking
enhancement of compensation.
2. Brief facts of the case:
On 16.11.2013 at about 3.45 p.m. when the claimant along with others were traveling
in a car bearing Registration No. KA-02-D-7980 and when they reached near four
road junction on Bangalore to Palamaner road, the driver of the car bearing
Registration No.KA-03-MF-3478 came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed
against the car in which the claimant and others was traveling. As a result, he
sustained injuries and immediately he was shifted to the Government Hospital and
later he was shifted to St. Johns Hospital, Bengaluru. After recovering from injuries,
the claimant filed a claim petition before the Tribunal. In order to support his case,
he examined himself as PW-3 and submitted certain documents. On the other hand,
the Insurance Company has examined two witness and produced one document.
After appreciation of the evidence, the Tribunal granted compensation of
Rs.1,40,994/- with interest at 8% p.a. The claimant being aggrieved by the same, has
preferred this appeal seeking enhancement of compensation.
3. Only contention taken by the learned counsel for the appellant that the claimant has sustained left
hemi paresis acute on chornic SDH hypertension. Immediately after the accident, the claimant was
shifted to Government Hospital and treated for 2 days as inpatient, and later he was shifted to St.
Johns Hospital and treated for 10 days. Since, the appellant has not examined the doctor, the
Tribunal is not justified in not granting any compensation under the category of "loss of future
earnings". Therefore, the learned counsel for the appellant prays for allowing the appeal by
enhancing the compensation awarded by the Tribunal.

4. Per contra, the learned counsel for the Insurance Company has contended that the injuries
sustained by the claimant is simple in nature. Moreover, the claimant has not examined the doctor
to assess the disability suffered by the claimant. Hence, the Tribunal considering all these aspects
has rightly awarded the compensation as aforementioned. Therefore, he prays for dismissal of the
appeal.
5. Heard the learned counsel for the parties, and perused the records.
6. It is not in dispute that the claimant had sustained injuries in a road traffic accident occurred on
16.11.2013. As per the wound certificate, Ex.P-18, the claimant has sustained sutured wounds over
forehead measuring 5 cm and 6 cm in length. The discharge summary Ex.P-19, reveals that the
claimant has suffered left hemi paresis acute on chronic SDH hypertension, and he underwent left
parietal craniotomy and SDH evacuation on 19.1.2014. Bone flap with titanium implants.
7. The claimant has not examined the doctor to assess the whole body disability suffered by him.
Therefore, he is not entitled for compensation under the category of "loss of future earnings".
Nevertheless, considering the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, the discomfort and
unhappiness the claimant has to undergo in his life, it is just and reasonable to grant an additional
compensation of Rs.50,000/-, which would meet the ends of justice.
8. For the reasons stated above, this appeal is partly allowed. The claimant is entitled for an
additional compensation of Rs.50,000/- with interest at 8% p.a.
9. The Insurance Company is directed to deposit, with the learned Tribunal, the entire
compensation amount, along with an interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of filing of the claim
petition till the date of realization, within a period of three weeks from the date of receipt of the
certified copy of this judgment. The amount so deposited shall be released forthwith to the appellant
by the learned Tribunal after verifying his identity.
