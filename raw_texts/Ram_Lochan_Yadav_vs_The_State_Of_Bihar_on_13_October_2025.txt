ORAL JUDGMENT
Date : 13-10-2025
1. The writ petition is filed for the following
reliefs:-
"That this is an application for
issuance of a writ in the nature of
certiorari to quash the decision dated
25.02.2019
of the Selection Committee for selection of the PDS Dealer for PDS relating to Inarwa Gram
Panchayat of the Ghoghardiha Block, Madhubani, district, whereby the candidature of the petitioner
has been rejected and recommendation Patna High Court CWJC No.14958 of 2019 dt.13-10-2025
for selection of the respondent No. 6 has been made for PDS Dealer licence and further for issuance
of writ in the nature of Mandamus and /or any other appropriate writ, order or direction for the
licence of PDS Dealer of Inarwa Gram Panchayat under Ghoghardiha Block, District, Madhubani."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016
provides for the provision of revision. Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:

"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
Patna High Court CWJC No.14958 of 2019 dt.13-10-2025
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months.
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Patna High Court CWJC No.14958 of 2019
dt.13-10-2025 Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal. Therefore, the petitioner is
directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional Commissioner.
5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the concerned authority to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within one month from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the Patna High Court CWJC No.14958 of 2019 dt.13-10-2025
complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority concerned, and the authority shall dispose
of the same within three months from the date of filing of the same.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
