CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH
and
HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BIRENDRA KUMAR
CAV JUDGMENT
(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ASHWANI KUMAR SINGH)
Date :01-10-2019
In the aforementioned appeals, preferred under
Section 101(5) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection
of Children) Act, 2015 (for short 'the Act of 2015'), the
appellants have challenged the order passed by the
Children's Court whereby their respective applications for bail
have been rejected in respect of cases in which they have
been made accused.
2. Since the facts of all the appeals are not
relevant, as they have been referred to the Division Bench
for the limited purpose, the facts are being extracted from
Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 2117 of 2019.
3. The appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 2117

3/137
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 2
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
of 2019 has been made accused in Buxar (Town) P. S. Case
No. 236 of 2018 dated 08.05.2018 registered inter alia
under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He was taken
into custody on 09.05.2018 and was produced before the
Juvenile Justice Board (for short 'Board'), Buxar. The Board,
in exercise of powers conferred under Section 94 of the Act
of 2015 determined his age to be 17 years, 2 months and
20 days on the date of commission of the offence. Since the
offence alleged to have been committed by the appellant is
heinous one and he had completed the age of 16 years on
the date of commission of the offence, the Board conducted
a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and
physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to
understand the consequences of the offence and the
circumstances in which he had allegedly committed the
offence and passed an order that there is a need for trial of
the said child as an adult in accordance with the provisions
enumerated in Section 18(2) of the Act of 2015 vide order
dated 12.10.2018.
4. The appellant moved an application for
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
4/137
bail before the Children's Court, Buxar for grant of bail in
Buxar (Town) P. S. Case No. 236 of 2018, which was
rejected vide order dated 11.12.2018.
5. Being aggrieved by the order passed by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 3
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
the Children's Court, the appellant filed an application for
bail before this Court under Section 439 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short 'CrPC') vide Cr. Misc.
No. 7470 of 2019.
6. The aforesaid Cr. Misc. No. 7470 of 2019
was dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the appellant to
file appropriate application before the appropriate court vide
order dated 23.04.2019 as the counsel for the appellant
sought leave to withdraw the application on the ground of
juvenility of the appellant.
7. The said order dated 23.04.2019 is set
out hereinbelow :-
23.04.2019
"Heard.
Counsel for the petitioner seeks permission to withdraw this application as the petitioner is said to
be juvenile.
Permission is granted.
Accordingly, this application filed in Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
connection with Buxar (T) P.S. Case no. 236 of 2018 is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the
petitioner to make appropriate application before the appropriate court."
8. Thereafter, the appellant filed the instant appeal under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015
challenging the order dated 11.12.2018 passed by the Children's Court, Buxar whereby his
application for grant of bail was rejected.
9. Learned Single Judge while hearing the appeal doubted maintainability of the appeal against the
order of the Children's Court. After consideration of various provisions of the Act of 2015, learned
Single Judge framed three questions and desired the same to be answered by a Division Bench.
10. The operative part of the order dated 09.07.2019 whereby the learned Single Judge has referred
the case to Division Bench is set out hereinbelow :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 4
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
"14. After having been declared child in conflict with law even relating to Buxar (T) P.
S. Case No.235 of 2018, after rejection of prayer by the Children Court, the same
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 has been challenged
through Criminal Miscellaneous. Once the prayer of an accused has been entertained
by the Co-
ordinate Bench under Criminal Miscellaneous, then in that circumstance, whether an
appeal in terms of Section 101(5) of the Act would be entertainable while enjoying the
same status. The conflicting stand coupled with the order dated 05.02.2019 passed
under Cr.Misc. No.4848 of 2019 gives an impression that the issue in hand needs
authoritative pronouncement as, with great respect to the esteemed brother, I did not
agree. So, the matter is to be considered by the Division Bench and for that, the
following points are being formulated:-
a) Whether the child in conflict with law falling in between 16 to 18 years should be
acknowledged, dealt with independently relating to serious offence, heinous offences.
b) Whether the opportunity in accordance with Section 12 of the Act identifying the
Board to pass an appropriate order whenever child in conflict with law is produced
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 regarding bail matter,
could also include the Children Court.
c) Whether the procedure so allowed to be followed in accordance with Section 19(1)
of the Act will attract the procedure of bail to be cared under the Act or under the
Code. In the background of presence of Section(1) as well as Section 101(5) of the Act.
15. Accordingly, office is directed to place the matter before the Division Bench after
taking permission from Hon'ble the Chief Justice."
11. Since the reference was desired to be resolved by a Division Bench, the same has come up for
consideration before this Court.
12. Subsequently, Cr. Appeal (SJ) Nos.1962 and 1549 of 2019 were filed under Section 101(5) of the
Act of 2015 by the respective appellants challenging the order passed by the Children's Court,
Sitamarhi whereby their respective applications for bail were rejected. Those appeals have also been
referred by the learned Single Judge to the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 Division Bench to be heard together with Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 2117 of 2019 as the
issues involved are identical.
13. After having examined various statutory provisions under the Act of 2015 and the CrPC and the
submissions advanced at the Bar in the light of reference order of the learned Single Judge,
following ancillary questions of immense significance, have emerged and need to be extensively
dealt with :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 5
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
(i) Under which provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is
alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail during
the pendency of preliminary assessment by the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015 ?
(ii) Under which provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is
alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail after
the transfer of his case to Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 the
Children's Court for trial by the Board ?
(iii) Whether the powers conferred on Board in the matter of bail to a person, who is apparently a
child alleged to be in conflict with law are also available to the Children's Court ?
(iv) Whether seriousness of the offence alleged is a ground for rejecting the bail in case of a child in
conflict with law ?
(v) Whether an appeal under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 or an application under Section 439
of the CrPC would be maintainable before the High Court by any person aggrieved by the order
granting or rejecting bail by the Children's Court ?
(vi) What is the scope of Section 19(1)
(i) of the Act of 2015 in connection with the trial of a child as an adult ? Whether the provisions of
Section 19 of the Act of 2015 are mandatory or the Children's Court has to compulsorily follow the
recommendations of the Board made Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
under Section 15 read with Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015 ?
(vii) What is the scope of application of the provisions of CrPC after the Board transfers the trial of
the case to the Children's Court having jurisdiction to try such offences and the Children's Court
decides that there is a need for trial of the child as an adult ?
14. We have heard Mr. Ajay Kumar Thakur, Mr. Bachan Jee Ojha and Mr. Uday Kumar, learned
advocates for the appellants, Smt. Usha Kumari and Mr. Zeyaul Hoda, learned Additional Public
Prosecutors for the State and Mr. Digvijay Kumar Ojha, learned advocate for the informant of Buxar
(Town) P. S. Case No. 236 of 2018.
15. Mr. Ajay Kumar Thakur, learned advocate appearing for the appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ)
No.1962 of 2019 submitted that seriousness of the offence alleged is not a ground for rejecting bail
in a case of a child in conflict with law. He argued that there is fundamental difference between the
Criminal Justice System and the Juvenile Justice System. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of
2019 dt.01-10-2019 Under the Juvenile Justice System, emphasis is placed on restoration and
rehabilitation rather than on punitive action. He contended that while considering an application for
bail to a child in conflict with law, Section 12 of the Act of 2015 needs to be read in consonance with
three principles mentioned in Section 3 of the Act of 2015, i.e., principle of repatriation and
restoration, fresh start and institutionalization as a measure of last resort. Bail should be granted to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 6
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
every juvenile as a matter of right and refusal should be done as an exception only where the
grounds for refusal of bail, as mentioned in Section 12 of the Act of 2015 are fulfilled. He urged that
the law, as laid down in Section 12 of the Act of 2015 is equally applicable in case of a child, who has
completed or is above the age of 16 years and is alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence'. He
can maintain his application under Section 12 of the Act of 2015 during the pendency of the
preliminary assessment by the Board under Section 15. He can also maintain his application for bail
under Section 12 of the Act of 2015 before the Children's Court after his case is transferred by the
Board for Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 trial as an adult. According
to him, in view of the express provision prescribed under Section 8(2) of the Act of 2015, the powers
conferred on the Board under the Act of 2015 can also be exercised by the High Court and the
Children's Court. On the basis of the aforesaid submissions, he canvassed that the powers conferred
on Board in the matter of bail to a person, who is apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law
are also available to the Children's Court and the High Court. He urged that the Act of 2015 does not
contemplate filing of an application for bail under the provisions of the CrPC. According to him,
Section 372 in Chapter XXIX of the CrPC provides that no appeal shall lie from any judgment or
order of a criminal court except as provided for by the Code or any other law for the time being in
force. As there is no provision in Chapter XXIX of the CrPC enabling any person aggrieved by an
order granting or refusing bail by the Children's Court, no appeal under the provisions of the CrPC
can be filed against any order passed by the Children's Court. He argued that any person, aggrieved
by any order including order granting or refusing Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 bail passed by the Children's Court, can assail the order by way of filing statutory
appeal before the High Court under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015. He contended that a joint
reading of the Sections 19(1)(i) and 19(1)(ii) would make it clear that the said provisions give option
to the Children's Court to try the transferred child as an adult or not to deal with the child as an
adult. He submitted that the Children's Court is duty bound to decide as to whether or not there is
need for trial of the child in conflict with law, who has been transferred before it, as an adult. It
cannot dispense with its mandatory duty in this regard.
16. Mr. Bachan Jee Ojha, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No.2117 of
2019 adopting the submissions made by Mr. Thakur submitted that once a preliminary assessment
report has been received from the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015, the Children's Court is
obliged to examine whether or not there is any need for his trial as an adult in terms of Section 19(1)
of the Act of 2015 and pass appropriate orders in this regard before proceeding ahead with his trial.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 He has strenuously argued that a
child in conflict with law cannot be denied bail solely on the basis of the gravity of the offence and
the embargo in the matter of grant of bail envisaged under the CrPC. According to him, the
provisions of the CrPC cannot be pressed into service either before the Board or before the
Children's Court or before the High Court while dealing with an application for bail on behalf of a
child in conflict with law either in course of inquiry or trial or appeal.
17. Mr. Uday Kumar, learned counsel appearing for appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 1549 of 2019
has adopted the submissions made by Mr. Thakur, learned counsel for the appellant in Cr. Appeal
(SJ) No.1962 of 2019.

Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
18. Per contra, Smt. Usha Kumari, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that
seriousness of the offence would certainly be a ground for rejecting bail in case of a child in conflict
with law. She contended that changes introduced in the Act of 2015 and transfer of child in conflict
with law in the age group of 16 to Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 18
years to the Children's Court; who have allegedly committed 'heinous offence', have been made with
a purpose. They are to be tried in terms of the provisions of the CrPC and, thus, in their case, while
considering bail or holding trial the provisions of the CrPC would be applicable. She contended that
the bail application on behalf of a child, who is alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' has to
be filed under the provisions of Section 437 before the Board and under Section 439 of the CrPC
before the Children's Court after transfer of his case for trial to the Children's Court.
19. Mr. Zeyaul Hoda, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State submitted that once a
preliminary assessment report has been received from the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015,
the Children's Court may accept the report and proceed further for trial of the child as an adult or
take a decision as to whether there is need for trial of the child as an adult or not as stipulated under
Sections 19(1)(i) and 19(1)(ii) of the Act of 2015. He argued that it is not mandatory for the
Children's Court, on Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 receipt of
preliminary assessment report, to again decide as to which of the two courses provided by Section
19(1)(i) and 19(1)(ii) is to be adopted.
20. While fully concurring with the views expressed by the learned Additional Public Prosecutors,
Mr. Digvijay Kumar Ojha, learned advocate appearing for the informant of Buxar (Town) P. S. Case
No. 236 of 2018 submitted that considering the gravity of the problems and issues involved with the
children in the age group of 16 to 18 and, in the aftermath of Nirbhaya rape case, the legislature
introduced several changes in law. As per changes brought in the Act of 2015, children between age
group of 16 to 18 can now be tried as an adult for 'heinous offences'. Their bail application has to be
differently dealt with and based on the outcome of the trial, children falling between the aforesaid
age group have to be sentenced accordingly. Thus, in their case, the principles mentioned in Section
3 of the Act of 2015 would not be applicable. Their bail application can be refused on the ground of
gravity of the offence and/or other grounds under the CrPC and their cases Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 would not be covered by the law as laid down in Section 12
of the Act of 2015, he contended.
21. Having heard the parties, in order to find out the answer to the questions to be determined in
these cases, it would be necessary to appreciate the Jurisprudence of the Juvenile Justice System in
India, which led to enactment of the Act of 2015. It would also be of salience to look into history,
concept and philosophy of the Juvenile Justice System chronologically.
22. Right from inception, the philosophy behind the Juvenile Justice System is to reform,
rehabilitate and reintegrate a child in conflict with law and a child in need of care and protection.
The philosophy in dealing with children committing offence is remarkably different from an adult
committing an offence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 8
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
23 The first doctrine in dealing with children of both the categories is the doctrine of parens patriae.
In the juvenile justice legal system, parens patriae is a doctrine that allows the State to step-in and
serve as a guardian for children, the mentally ill, the incompetent, the elderly or the Patna High
Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 disabled persons, who are unable to care for
themselves. It refers to the public policy power of the State to intervene against an absurd or
negligent parents, legal guardian or informal caretaker and to act as parent of any child or individual
who is in need of protection. Normally, the natural parents and family are expected to take care of
their children, but when they fail the State steps into shoes of the parents and family to provide the
same care and protection as their own parents and families should have provided for them.
24. With passage of time, the principle of parens patriae shifted to the right approach, which
respects the constitutional and procedural rights of a juvenile. A child in conflict with law should be
treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which
reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and, which
takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the
child's assuming a constructive role in the society.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
25. In India, the first legislation enacted for the children in distress is the Apprentices Act, 1850. It
applied to children above the age of ten, and under the age of 18 years found to have committed
petty offences and vagabonds. Under this Act, the children in distress were to be trained for trade
and commerce. The Preamble of Apprentices Act, 1850, which explains the intent behind the
enactment is set out hereinbelow:-
"For better enabling children, and especially orphans and poor children brought up
in public charity, to learn trades, crafts and employments, by which, when they came
to full age, may gain a livelihood."
26. In the above background, it is significant to refer to the provisions of Indian Penal Code, 1860,
i.e., Sections 82 and 83. Section 82 of the Indian Penal Code deems children under 7 years of age
incapable of forming an intent to commit a crime. Section 83 of the Indian Penal Code exempts
child above 7 years of age and under 12, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding
to Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 judge of the nature and
consequences of his conduct on that occasion from criminal responsibility.
27. Thereafter, Reformatory Schools Act, 1876 and Amendment Act, 1897 were enacted for
delinquent children, which empowered the government to establish reformatory schools for juvenile
delinquents. Under this Act, provisions were made to keep juveniles in custody in reformatory
schools for a time period of 2 to 7 years, but after attainment of the age of 18 years, they were not to
be kept in reformatory schools.
28. Another important legislation for children was the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (for short
'Code'). Section 29(B) of the Code provided that any person of 15 years of age, who had committed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 9
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
offence not punishable with death or transportation for life, would be tried by a District Magistrate
or any Magistrate empowered under the Reformatory Schools Act, 1897. Thus, the juvenile
delinquents were taken out of the jurisdiction of ordinary courts in the matter of trial. Section 399 of
the Code provided for confinement in reformatories established Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 by the Local Governments as a fit place for confinement instead of
being imprisoned in a criminal jail for offenders under the age of 15 years and Section 562 of the
Code conferred power upon the Court to release on probation of good conduct youthful offenders
under 21 years of age under certain conditions instead of sentencing them to prison. These
provisions along with the Reformatory Schools Act,1897 made a significant change in the juvenile
penal philosophy from punishment to reform and rehabilitation.
29. Thereafter, the recommendations made by the Indian Jail Committee (1919-1920) suggested
that juvenile prisoners are amenable to reformation and their detention in prisons is undesirable,
for, their simple mind may be polluted permanently by the atmosphere of Jail life. A child offender
was mainly a product of unfavourable environment. He was entitled to new opportunities to grow
and live in more congenial conditions. The Committee opined that juveniles could be reformed by
re-education and proper treatment. It recommended that Borstal institutions should be established
for reformation of juveniles. It also Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
recommended for constitution of juvenile courts.
30. Thereafter, under the Juvenile Justice System in India, firstly the Juvenile Court was established
under Madras Children Act, 1920.
31. After independence of India in 1947, the Parliament passed the first legislation on children,
namely, The Children's Act, 1960. This was made applicable in centrally administered union
territories and the States having no juvenile legislation were made free to adopt it. It was passed to
function as model legislation and for implementation in union territories. This Act established
separate child welfare courts to handle cases relating to neglected children. It also created the
position of a Probation Officer to advise and assist the neglected or delinquent children. In addition,
it established separate Children's Court for cases related to delinquent juveniles, thereby supporting
the judicial process for delinquent and neglected children.
32. It would be relevant to note here that prior to the passing of The Children's Act, 1960, there
existed different Children's Act in different States. The most Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117
of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 important aspect of the Children's Act, 1960 was complete prohibition of use
of police station or jail under any circumstances for children covered within its purview. However, at
this stage, Juvenile Justice System in India was not uniform because each State had its own
standards, norms and practices.
33. The necessity of a uniform Children Act across the Country gave rise to enactment of Juvenile
Justice Act, 1986 (for short 'the Act of 1986').
34. The Act of 1986 promoted the best interest of the juveniles by incorporating the important
provisions of Indian Constitution. The Act of 1986 was influenced by 'United Nations Declaration of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 10
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
the Rights of the Child, 1959' and 'United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration
of Juvenile Justice ("The Beijing Rules"), 1985'. The detention of juveniles in police lock-up or jail
was abolished by the Act of 1986. It also recommended to establish Juvenile Homes for the
reception of neglected juveniles, Special Homes for reception of delinquent juveniles and
Observation Homes for Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 the
temporary reception of juveniles during pendency of the inquiry and trial and Aftercare Homes for
the purpose of taking care of juveniles after discharge from Observation Homes or Special Homes.
The object of the Act of 1986 was to protect juvenile from criminalization, penalization and
stigmatization. The Act of 1986 repealed various Children's Acts enacted in different States and
provided a uniform Juvenile Justice System in India. Boys under the age of 16 and girls under the
age of 18 were defined as Juveniles.
35. Noticing various shortcoming in the Act of 1986 when India signed and ratified the 'United
Nations Convention of Rights of Children' in December, 1992, the Act of 1986 was repealed and
replaced by The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (for short 'the Act of
2000'), which came into force from 1st April 2001. The Act of 2000 defined the term 'juvenile' as a
person who having not completed the age of 18 years. The statement of objects and reasons for the
Act of 2000 specified that it was enacted to bring the operation of Juvenile Justice System in
conformity with Convention Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 of
Rights of Children and other United Nations Instruments signed by India. It incorporated the justice
as well as the right approach towards children. It dealt with juveniles in conflict with law and
children in need of care and protection.
36. The Act of 2000 was amended in 2006.
The Amendment Act, 2006 brought several amendments in the Principal Act. By the amendment, it
was made clear that crucial date for determination of age of a juvenile in conflict with law would be
the date of commission of offence. Another important change was insertion of Section 7A, which
provided that a claim of juvenility may be raised before any court and it shall be recognized at any
stage, even after final disposal of the case. The amended Act further clarified that under any
condition, a juvenile in conflict with law should not be kept in a police lock-up or jail.
37. The Act of 2000 was again amended in 2011 to address gaps in its implementation and make the
law more child friendly.
38. The brutal gang rape and subsequent Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 death of a girl in Delhi (Nirbhaya) on 16 th December, 2012 gave rise to a debate that
the provisions and system under the Act of 2000 are ill equipped and needed modification to tackle
the children in the age group of 16 to 18. After a long debate, the Juvenile Justice Bill was introduced
in Lok Sabha on 8th August, 2014. It was passed by Lok Sabha on 7 th May, 2015 and Rajya Sabha
on 22nd December, 2015 and received the presidential assent on 31st December, 2015 and the Act of
2015 came into force on 15th January, 2016 with its publication in the Gazette of India.

39. The Act of 2015 governs children alleged and found to be in conflict with law and children in
need of care and protection.
40. It has been enacted to fulfill the objects of the Constitution in clause (3) of Article 15, clauses (e)
and
(f) of Article 39, Article 45 and Article 47, which confer powers and imposes duties on the State to
ensure that all needs of children are met and their basic human rights are fully protected.
41. It is worth setting out the statement of Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 objects and reasons of the Act in full hereinbelow:-
"Statement of Objects and Reasons.- Article 15 of the Constitution, inter alia, confers upon the State
powers to make special provision for children. Articles 39(e) and (f), 45 and 47 further makes the
State responsible for ensuring that all needs of children are met and their basic human rights are
protected.
2. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, ratified by India on 11th December,
1992, requires the State Parties to undertake all appropriate measures in case of a child alleged as,
or accused of, violating any penal law, including (a) treatment of the child in a manner consistent
with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth (b) reinforcing the child's respect for the
human rights and fundamental freedoms of others (c) taking into account the child's age and the
desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in
society.
3. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act was enacted in 2000 to provide for the
protection of Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 children. The Act was
amended twice in 2006 and 2011 to address gaps in its implementation and make the law more
child-friendly. During the course of the implementation of the Act, several issues arose such as
increasing incidents of abuse of children in institutions, inadequate facilities, quality of care and
rehabilitation measures in Homes, high pendency of cases, delays in adoption due to faulty and
incomplete processing, lack of clarity regarding roles, responsibilities and accountability of
institutions and, inadequate provisions to counter offences against children such as corporal
punishment, sale of children for adoption purposes, etc. have highlighted the need to review the
existing law.
4. Further, increasing cases of crimes committed by children in the age group of 16-18 years in
recent years makes it evident that the current provisions and system under the Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, are ill equipped to tackle child offenders in this age
group. The data collected by the National Crime Records Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of
2019 dt.01-10-2019 Bureau establishes that crimes by children in the age group of 16-18 years have
increased especially in certain categories of heinous offences.

5. Numerous changes are required in the existing Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)
Act, 2000 to address the above mentioned issues and therefore, it is proposed to repeal existing
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and re- enact a comprehensive
legislation inter alia to provide for general principles of care and protection of children, procedures
in case of children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law, rehabilitation
and social re-integration measures for such children, adoption of orphan, abandoned and
surrendered children, and offences committed against children. This legislation would thus ensure
proper care, protection, development, treatment and social re-integration of children in difficult
circumstance by adopting a child-friendly approach keeping in view the best interest of the child in
mind.

6. The notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions contained in the Bill.
7. This Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives."
42. Para-1 of the statement of objects and reasons is a key to unlock the legislative intent. It refers to
Articles 15, 39(e) and (f), 45 and 47 of the Constitution and states that such articles confer upon the
State the powers to make special provision for children. It further makes the State responsible for
ensuring that all needs of children are met and their basic human rights are protected.
43. Para-2 of the statement of objects and reasons requires the State to undertake all appropriate
measures in case of a child alleged as, or accused of, violating any penal law, including (a) treatment
of the child in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth; (b)
reinforcing the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others; and (c)
taking into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 child's assuming a constructive role
in society.
44. Para-4 of the statement of objects and reasons is focused towards child in conflict with law in
case of 'heinous offences' in the age group of 16-18 years. It states that existing provisions and
system under the Act of 2000 are ill equipped to tackle child offenders in the age group of 16-18
years as the crimes by children in the said age group had increased especially in certain categories of
'heinous offences'.
45. Para-5 of the statement of objects and reasons while proposing to repeal the existing Act of 2000
and re-enact a comprehensive legislation inter alia to provide for general principles of care and
protection of children, procedures in case of children in need of care and protection and children in
conflict with law, rehabilitation and social re- integration measures for such children, re-assures the

of children in difficult circumstances by adopting a child friendly approach keeping in mind the best
interest of the child. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019

institutions and bodies established under the Act.
58. The opening statements of any enactment Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019

64. We have noticed hereinabove that the Act of 2015 classifies offences in three categories. They
are:
'petty offences', 'serious offences' and 'heinous offences'.
65. 'Petty offences' are those offences for which the maximum punishment under the Indian Penal
Code or any other law for the time being in force is imprisonment upto 3 years. 'Serious offences' are
those offences for which the maximum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law
for the time being in force is imprisonment between 3 to 7 years and 'heinous offences' are those
offences for which the minimum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the
time being in force is imprisonment for 7 years or more.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 35
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
66. The legislature has consciously classified the offences under different categories in order to
achieve the object of the Act of 2015.
67. The Act of 2015 treats all the children below 18 years equally except in the age group of 16 to 18
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 years, who are alleged to have
committed 'heinous offences'.
68. Section 3 of the Act of 2015 enumerates the general principles to be followed in administration
of the Act. It regulates the conduct and behaviour of all persons functioning under the Act. It states
that the Central Government, the State Governments, the Board and other agencies, as the case may
be, while implementing the provisions of the Act shall be guided by the fundamental principles
enumerated in clauses (i) to (xvi).
69. Section 4 of the Act of 2015 provides for constitution of one or more Board by the State
Government for every district for exercising the powers and discharging the duties conferred or
imposed on them in relation to children in conflict with law under the Act. It also provides for the
composition of the Board, which shall consist of a Metropolitan or a Judicial Magistrate of the first
class (not being Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate) with at least three years
of experience and two social workers from two different reputed non-governmental organizations.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
70. Section 5 of the Act of 2015 clarifies that when an inquiry has been initiated in respect of any
child under this Act, and during the course of inquiry, if child completes the age of eighteen years,
then, the inquiry may be continued by the Board and orders may be passed in respect of that person
as if such person had continued to be a child.
71. Section 6 of the Act of 2015 provides that if a person, who has completed 18 years of age but is
below 21 years, is apprehended for committing an offence when he was below the age of 18 years,
then the person shall be treated as a child during the process of inquiry. It further states that if the
person is not released on bail by the Board then the person shall be placed in a Place of Safety
during the process of inquiry. If the Board after inquiry comes to the conclusion that the person has
committed any offence, then the person shall be placed in a Place of Safety till he completes his
term.
72. Section 7 of the Act of 2015 provides that the Board shall ensure that all procedures are child
friendly Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 and that the venue is not
intimidating to the child and does not resemble regular Courts. Further, the times at which the
Board shall meet and the rules that shall be observed in regard to the transaction of business at its
meetings, shall be prescribed. It further states that when the Board is not sitting, a child in conflict
with law may be produced before an individual member of the Board. It also states that a Board may
act even in the absence of any member of the Board and no order passed by the Board shall be
invalid in the absence of any member during any stage of proceedings. Section 5 of the Act of 2015
clarifies that at the time of final disposal of the case or in making any order under Section 18(3) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 36
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
the Act of 2015 at least two members including the Principal Magistrate shall be present and in the
event of any difference of opinion among the members of the Board in the interim or final disposal,
the opinion of the majority shall prevail. In case there is no majority then the opinion of the
Principal Magistrate, shall prevail.
73. Section 8 of the Act of 2015 provides the functions and responsibilities of the Board. It states
that the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 Board constituted for any
district shall have the power to deal exclusively with all proceedings under this Act relating to
children in conflict with law in the area of jurisdiction of such Board.
74. Section 8(2) of the Act of 2015, which is noteworthy for us provides that the powers conferred on
the Board under the Act may also be exercised by the High Court and the Children's Court, when the
proceedings come before them as provided under Section 19 of the Act of 2015 or in appeal, revision
or otherwise.
75. Section 8(3) of the Act of 2015 specifies the functions and responsibilities of the Board, but those
are only illustrative and not exhaustive and any additional functions may be prescribed in the rules
to be framed under the Act.
76. On a careful consideration of the provisions prescribed under Section 8 of the Act of 2015,
specially its sub-section (2), the answer to the third question "Whether the powers conferred on
Board in the matter Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 of bail to a
person, who is apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law are also available to the Children's
Court" becomes abundantly clear.
77. In view of clear, unambiguous and specific stipulation in Section 8(2) of the Act of 2015, which
provides that the powers conferred on the Board under the Act may also be exercised by the High
Court and the Children's Court, we unhesitatingly conclude and hold that in the matter of grant of
bail to a person, who is apparently a child and is alleged to have committed a bailable or
non-bailable offence, the powers conferred on the Board under the Act of 2015 are also available to
the Children's Court.
78. The third question for determination is answered, accordingly.
79. Section 9 of the Act of 2015 provides that when a Magistrate, who is not empowered to exercise
the powers of Board under this Act is of the opinion that the person alleged to have committed the
offence and brought before him is a child then in such a case the Magistrate shall, Patna High Court
CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 without any delay, record his opinion and forward the
child immediately, and send record of the proceeding, to the Board having jurisdiction over the
proceeding. In case, a person alleged to have committed an offence claims that he was a child on the
date of commission of the offence before a court other than a Board, or is the court itself is of the
opinion that the person was a child on the date of commission of the offence, then the court shall
make an inquiry, take such evidence as may be necessary (but not an affidavit) to determine the age
of the person, and shall record a finding on the matter, stating the age of the person as nearly as may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 37
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
be. This section further clarifies that such a claim can be raised before any court and it shall be
recognized at any stage, even after final disposal of the case. Such a claim shall be determined in
terms of the provisions contained in the Act and the rules made under the Act even if the person is
ceased to be a child on or before the date of commencement of the Act. This section further states
that if the court finds that a person has committed an offence and was a child on the date of
commission of the offence, it shall Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
forward the child to the Board for passing orders and the sentence. If any order and the sentence is
passed by the court, it shall be deemed to have no effect in such case. This section also states that in
case a person is required to be kept in protective custody, while the person's claim of being a child is
being inquired into, then such person may be placed, in the interim period, in a 'Place of Safety'.
80. Chapter IV of the Act of 2015 deals with procedure in relation to child in conflict with law.
81. Section 10 under Chapter IV of the Act of 2015 provides that as soon as a child alleged to be in
conflict with law is apprehended by the police, he shall be placed under the charge of the special
juvenile police unit or the designated child welfare police officer. The special juvenile police unit or
the designated child welfare police officer shall produce the child before the Board without any loss
of time, but within a period of 24 hours of apprehending the child excluding the time necessary for
the journey from the place where the child was apprehended. It clarifies that in no case a child
alleged to be in conflict with law shall be placed in a Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 police lock-up or lodged in a jail. It also provides that the State Government shall
make rules consistent with the Act to provide for persons through whom (including registered
voluntary or non-governmental organization) any child alleged to be in conflict with law may be
produced before the Board and to provide for the manner in which the child alleged to be in conflict
with law may be sent to an Observation Home or Place of Safety as the case may.
82. Section 11 under Chapter IV of the Act of 2015 provides that any person in whose charge a child
in conflict with law is placed shall while the order is in force have responsibility of the child as if the
said person was the child's parent and responsible for the child's maintenance. It further clarifies
that the child shall continue to stay in the person's charge for the period stated by the Board. The
person shall continue to have charge of the child even when the child is claimed by the parents or
any other person except when the Board is of the opinion that the parent or any other person are fit
to exercise charge over such child.
83. Another important provision, which is Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 noteworthy for us is Section 12 in Chapter IV of the Act of 2015, which deals with bail
to a person who is apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law.
84. While interpreting Section 12, the Board is duty bound to be guided by the fundamental
principles enumerated in Section 3 of the Act of 2015, specially the principles of 'best interest',
'repatriation' and 'restoration' of child. The fundamental principles in Section 3(xii) provides that a
child shall be placed in institutional care as a step of last resort after making a reasonable inquiry.
The gravity and nature of the offence are immaterial for consideration of bail under the Act of 2015.
As per Section 12 of the Act of 2015, an application for bail is not decided by reference to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 38
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
classification of offences, as bailable or non-bailable under the CrPC. All persons alleged to be in
conflict with law and apparently a child when apprehended must be released except in the following
three circumstances when there is reasonable ground for believing that :-
(i) The release is likely to bring that person into association with any known criminal;
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
(ii) The release is likely to expose the said person to moral or psychological danger; and
(iii) The release would defeat the ends of justice.
85. In all cases, the Board is required to record its reason, if it refuses to release the child on bail and
the circumstances that laid to such a decision. Taking surety is not essential for ordering release of
the child on bail. The child may be released without surety also. The child may be placed under the
supervision of a 'probation officer' or under the care of any 'fit person' after release on bail. It further
provides that in case the court has directed release of the child on bail after fulfilling certain
conditions, but the child is unable to fulfill those conditions in the next seven days, the Board shall
modify those conditions.
86. The Board is vested with the power to grant bail to any person, who has not completed the age of
18 years irrespective of the nature of offence being 'bailable' or 'non-bailable' or specified in any of
three categories of the Act, as 'petty offences', 'serious offences' and 'heinous Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 offences'.
87. Our irresistible conclusion, on dealing with the provisions prescribed under Section 12 of the Act
of 2015, to answer the fourth question "Whether seriousness of the offence alleged is a ground for
rejecting the bail in case of a child in conflict with law ?" is, thus, plain and simple. Seriousness of
the offence alleged cannot be made a ground for rejecting bail in case of a child in conflict with law.
88. Thus, the fourth question for determination is answered, accordingly.
89. The reason for our answer is that the principle of bail under the Act of 2015 is not the same as
enumerated under Chapter XXXIII of the CrPC. Bail and not institutionalization continues to be the
principle under the Act.
90. Section 13 of the Act of 2015 provides that where a child alleged to be in conflict with law is
apprehended, the Child Welfare Police Officer of the police station, or the special juvenile police unit
to which such child Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 is brought, shall,
as soon as possible after apprehending the child, inform the parents or guardian of such child, if
they can be found, and direct them to be present at the Board before which the child is produced.
The Probation Officer, or if no Probation Officer is available, the Child Welfare Police Officer, shall
also inform the Probation Officer or in his absence a Child Welfare Officer to prepare the social
investigation report containing information regarding antecedents and family background of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 39
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
child and other material circumstances likely to be of assistance to the Board for making the inquiry.
Section 13(2) of the Act of 2015 provides that if a child is released on bail, the Probation Officer or
the Child Welfare Officer shall be informed by the Board.
91. Section 14 of the Act of 2015 provides for inquiry by the Board regarding a child in conflict with
law.
92. Section 14(1) of the Act of 2015 provides that where a child alleged to be in conflict with law is
produced before a Board, then the Board shall hold an inquiry in accordance with the provisions of
the Act and may Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 pass such orders in
relation to the child as it deems fit under Sections 17 and 18 of the Act of 2015.
93. Section 14(2) of the Act of 2015 provides that inquiry under this section shall be completed
within a period of four months from the date of first production of the child before the Board, unless
the period is extended, for a maximum period of two more months by the Board, having regard to
the circumstances of the case and after recording the reasons in writing for such extension.
94. Section 14(3) of the Act of 2015 provides that a preliminary assessment in case of 'heinous
offences' under Section 15 shall be disposed of by the Board within a period of three months from
the date of first production of the child before the Board.
95. Section 14(4) of the Act of 2015 provides that in case of 'petty' or 'serious offences', if inquiry by
the Board remains inconclusive even after the extended period, the proceedings shall stand
terminated. Proviso to this section provides that for 'serious' or 'heinous offences', in case the Board
requires further extension of time for Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
completion of inquiry, the same shall be granted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate or, as the case may
be, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, for reasons to be recorded in writing.
96. Section 14(5) of the Act of 2015 provides the following steps to be taken by the Board to ensure
fair and speedy inquiry.
97. Section 15 of the Act of 2015, which enumerates special provisions to tackle the child offenders
committing 'heinous offences' in the age group of 16 to 18 years is equally important for us. If a child
in the age group of 16 to 18 years is alleged to have committed 'heinous offence', as defined in
Section 2(33) of the Act, the Board is required to conduct a preliminary assessment.
98. In order to determine, in case of a child in the age group of 16 to 18 years alleged to have
committed a 'heinous offence', whether he should be transferred to the Children's Court to be tried
as an adult, the Board has to follow certain essential steps.
99. Firstly, it must conclusively determine that Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 the child in conflict with law before it is above the age of 16 years, but below the age of
18 years on the date of commission of the offence. The determination of age is very crucial for the
child as the same has the potential to expose him to the possibility of being transferred to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 40
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
Children's Court to be tried as an adult.
100. Secondly, if the Board comes to the conclusion that the child before it was 16 years or above,
but below the age 18 years on the date of commission of the offence, it would be required to
conclusively determine whether the offence alleged to have been committed by him is a 'heinous
offence' or not.
101. Thirdly, transfer of a child for trial as an adult can only be done after preliminary assessment by
the Board. The word 'shall' in Section 15(1) indicates that it is mandatory for the Board to conduct
'preliminary assessment'. The 'preliminary assessment' has to be conducted to assess :-
(1) Child's mental and physical capacity to commit alleged offence;
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 (2) Child's ability to understand
consequences of the offence; and (3) the circumstances in which the child allegedly committed the
offence.
102. Fourthly, after the preliminary assessment, the Board is required to further determine whether
it would deal with the case of the child itself or transfer him to the Children's Court.
103. The aforesaid mandatory requirements are to be carefully conducted while determining
whether a child should be transferred to the Children's Court to be tried as an adult or not. The
legislature has provided that for the purpose of preliminary assessment the Board may take
assistance of an experienced psychologist or psycho-social worker or other experts.
104. It needs to be kept in mind at this juncture that Section 14(3) of the Act of 2015 obligates that
preliminary assessment in case of 'heinous offences' under Section 15 should be completed within
three months by the Board from the date of first production of the child before Patna High Court
CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 the Board.
105. If the Board is satisfied on preliminary assessment that the matter should be disposed of by the
Board then the Board shall follow the procedures, as far as may be, for trial in summons case under
the CrPC. In case, the Board after preliminary assessment under Section 15 of the Act passes an
order that there is need for trial of such child as an adult, it may order for transfer of the case to the
Children's Court having jurisdiction to try such offence.
106. Now, the stage is set for answering the first and the second questions : "(i) Under which
provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is alleged to have
committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail during the pendency
of preliminary assessment by the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015 ?" ; and "(ii) Under
which provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is alleged to
have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on Patna High Court
CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 bail after the transfer of his case to the Children's Court
for trial by the Board ?"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 41
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
107. The Act of 2015 is a complete code in itself. The legal proposition that a special act (the Act of
2015 in the present case) shall override the provisions of the general act (CrPC) is unexceptionable.
At this stage, it would be profitable to refer to Sections 4 and 5 of the CrPC, which are set out
hereinbelow :-
"Section 4. Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws.- (1) All
offences under the Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860) shall be investigated, inquired into,
tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained.
(2) All offences under any other law shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and
otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment
for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring
into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.
Section 5. Saving.- Nothing Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 contained in this Code shall, in the absence of a specific provision to
the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in force, or any special
jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any
other law for the time being in force."
108. A conjoint effect of Section 4(2) read with Section 5 of the CrPC is that all offences, whether
under the Indian Penal Code or under any other law, have to be investigated, inquired into, tried,
and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the CrPC, unless there be an enactment
regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such
offences, in which case an enactment will prevail over those of CrPC. The jurisdiction under Section
4 of the CrPC is comprehensive and to that extent till no valid machinery is set up under any Act for
investigation or trial, the jurisdiction of the machinery provided under the CrPC cannot be said to
have been excluded.
109. As a natural corollary, since the Act of 2015 is a special act, which contains provision for bail,
the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 same shall prevail over those of
the CrPC. From a close reading of Section 12, it would be evident that it is the only provision under
the Act of 2015, which deals with grant of bail to a child in conflict with law. Section 12 does not
debar a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is alleged to have committed a
'heinous offence' from maintaining his application for release on bail during the pendency of
preliminary assessment by the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015 or from maintaining an
application for release on bail after the transfer of his case to the Children's Court for trial.
110. For the reasons aforestated, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is
alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail under
Section 12 of the Act of 2015 during the pendency of preliminary assessment by the Board under
Section 15 of the Act of 2015.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 42
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
111. For the same reasons, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years and is Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 alleged to have committed a 'heinous
offence' can maintain his application for release on bail under Section 12 of the Act of 2015 after the
transfer of his case to the Children's Court.
112. The first and second questions for determination are answered, accordingly.
113. At this stage, in order to determine the remaining issues one has to keep in mind Section 18 of
the Act of 2015, which provides that where the Board is satisfied on inquiry that a child, irrespective
of his age, has committed a 'petty offence', or a 'serious offence', or a child below the age of 16 years
has committed a 'heinous offence', then, notwithstanding anything contrary contained in any other
law for the time being in force, and based on the nature of offence, specific need for supervision or
intervention, circumstances as brought out in the social investigation report and past conduct of the
child, the Board may, if it so thinks fit, pass any of the dispositional order, as discussed in clauses (a)
to (g) of Section 18 (1) of the Act of 2015.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
114. Additionally, the Board may also pass orders, as indicated in Section 18(2) (i) to (v) of the Act of
2015.
115. Further Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015 provides that where the Board, after preliminary
assessment under Section 15 of the Act of 2015, comes to the conclusion that there is need for trial of
the child as an adult, it may order, transfer of the trial of the case to the Children's Court having
jurisdiction to try such offences.
116. The sixth question framed by us is in two parts. The first part is "What is the scope of Section
19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015 in connection with the trial of a child as an adult ?" and the second part is
"Whether the provisions of Section 19 of the Act are mandatory or the Children's Court has to
compulsorily follow the recommendations of the Board made under Section 15 read with Section
18(3) of the Act of 2015?"
117. The answer to the above question will also be in two parts.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
118. Upon a case of a child having been transferred to the Children's Court, a duty has been cast
upon the Children's Court to further decide about the suitability of the child to be tried as an adult.
119. The words used in Section 19(1)(i) and 19(1)(ii) give two options to the Children's Court. First,
to try the transferred child as an adult and second not to deal with child as an adult.
120. The Children's Court is required to record its reason while arriving at a conclusion whether the
child should be treated as a child or as an adult, in view of Rule 13 (6) of the Rules.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 43
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
121. In case, the Children's Court decides to deal with child as a child, it has to conduct an inquiry as
a Board following the procedures for trial of summons case in accordance with the provisions of
Section 18 as would appear from the words used in Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015.
122. In case, it decides to try the child as an adult, it shall follow the procedures, as prescribed Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 by the CrPC for the purpose of trial by
Sessions Court and pass appropriate orders after trial without prejudice to the provisions of Sections
19 and 21 of the Act considering special 'needs of the child' the tenets of 'fair trial' and maintaining a
'child friendly' atmosphere as provided under Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015.
123. The aforesaid discussion answers the first part of the sixth question.
124. Having analysed scope of Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015, now let us examine the second part
of sixth question framed by us : "whether the provisions of Section 19 of the Act of 2015 are
mandatory or the Children's Court has to compulsorily follow the recommendations of the Board
made under Section 15 read with Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015?".
125. The opening expression used in Section 19(1) is "after the receipt of preliminary assessment
from the Board under Section 15, the Children's Court may decide" gives an impression that the
Children's Court may Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 or may not
decide in terms of Section 19 whether or not there is need for trial of the child as an adult.
126. However, if Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015 is read together with Rule 13(6) of the Rules
framed by the Central Government, which stipulates that the Children's Court shall record its reason
while arriving at a conclusion whether the child is to be treated as an adult or as a child, it would be
evident that the provisions of Section 19(1) are not optional.
127. The expression used in Rule 13(6) of the Rules is 'shall' and thus mandates the Children's Court
to record its reason while arriving at a conclusion whether the child is to be treated as an adult or a
child.
128. Hence, the answer to the second part of sixth question is that the provisions of Section 19(1) of
the Act of 2015 are mandatory. The Children's Court cannot dispense with the requirement of
deciding as to whether there is need to try the transferred child as an adult or to deal with the
transferred child as a child. In other words, the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 Children's Court has to compulsorily follow the recommendations of the Board made
under Section 15 read with Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015.
129. Thus, the second part of sixth question for determination is answered, accordingly.
130. The provisions under Section 19 mandates that Children's Court shall ensure that the final
order, with regard to a child in conflict with law, shall include an individual care plan for
rehabilitation of child, including follow-up by the probation officer or the District Child Protection
Unit or a social worker. The Children's Court is also required to ensure that the child, who is found
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 44
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
to be in conflict with law, is sent to a Place of Safety till he attains the age of 21 years, thereafter, the
person shall be transferred to a jail.
131. Proviso to Section 19(3) of the Act of 2015 provides that the reformative services including
educational services, skill development, alternative therapy such as counselling, behaviour
modification therapy, and psychiatric support shall be provided, to the child during the Patna High
Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 period of his stay in the Place of Safety.
132. Section 19(4) of the Act of 2015 provides that the Children's Court shall ensure that there is
periodic follow-up report every year by the probation officer or the District Child Protection Unit or
a social worker to evaluate the progress of the child in place of safety and to ensure that there is no
ill-treatment to the child in any form.
133. Section 19(5) of the Act of 2015 provides that reports under sub-section (4) shall be forwarded
to the Children's Court for record and follow-up, as may be required.
134. On a reading of Section 19 of the Act of 2015 in isolation, it would appear that the Children's
Court may order for long period of stay in each case insisting stay of the child in Place of Safety till
he attains the age of 21 years and, thereafter, he shall be transferred to jail. However, if we read
Section 19 with Section 20, the impression would be quite different.
135. Section 20 of the Act of 2015 provides that when a child in conflict with law attains the age of 21
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 years and is yet to complete term of
his stay, then the Children's Court shall provide for a follow-up by the probation officer or the
District Child Protection Unit or a social worker or by itself. The purpose of follow-up is to evaluate
if the child has undergone reformative changes and if the child can be a contributing member of the
society. Such evaluation has to be based on the progress records of the child under Section 19(4) of
the Act of 2015 along with evaluation. Such evaluation has to be made only if the child has attained
the age of 21 years, but has yet to complete the term of stay.
136. Section 20 of the Act of 2015 empowers the Children's Court to release a child from the Place of
Safety without being sent to jail on attaining the age of 21 years. Now, at this stage, what would be
relevant to be kept in mind is that though 'heinous offences' include offences for which the
minimum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law is imprisonment for 7 years or
more, on attaining age of 21 years, the Children's Court may release the child on such condition as it
deems fit which includes Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
appointment of a monitoring authority for the remainder of the prescribed term of stay. Thus, the
minimum imprisonment of 7 years or more in the definition of 'heinous offences' is for the purpose
of determining as to which matters may be transferred to the Children's Court.
137. Section 21 of the Act of 2015 provides that no child in conflict with law shall be sentenced to
death or for life imprisonment without the possibility of release for any such offence either under
the provisions of the Act or under the provisions of Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time
being in force.

Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
138. Section 22 of the Act of 2015 provides that despite anything contrary contained in CrPC or any
preventive detention law for the time being in force, no proceeding shall be instituted and no order
shall be passed against any child under Chapter VIII of the said CrPC.
139. Chapter VIII of the CrPC deals with preventive measures that may be taken by the police in
maintaining law and order. This Chapter's title is 'security for keeping the peace and for good
behaviour' and contains Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 elaborate
provisions on the powers of the Executive Magistrate to take measures with a view to prevent
commission of offence of breach of peace or disturbance of public tranquility.
140. Eventually, preventive measures are prohibited against children including passing of sentence
to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace. The measures provided in Chapter
VIII of the CrPC, which are to be taken mostly by the Executive Magistrate are completely
prohibited in case of children in conflict with law. In other words, the Act of 2015 bars any role of
the Executive Magistrate vis-a-vis children.
141. Section 23 of the Act of 2015 provides that in spite of anything contained in Section 223 of the
CrPC or any other law for the time being in force, no joint proceeding shall be conducted of a child
alleged to be in conflict with law with a person who is not child. It also provides that if during
inquiry by the Board or by the Children's Court, the person alleged in conflict with law is found to be
not a child then that person shall not be tried Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 along with child.
142. Having analysed the ambit and scope of the provisions prescribed under Sections 18 to 23 of
the Act of 2015 in extenso, the stage is set for determining the seventh question, i.e., : "what is the
scope of application of the provisions of CrPC after the Board transfers the trial of the case to the
Children's Court having jurisdiction to try such offences and the Children's Court decides that there
is a need for trial of the child as an adult ?".
143. On a perusal of the provisions prescribed under Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015, it is quite clear
that it provides for transfer of the 'trial' of the case to the Children's Court by the Board after
preliminary assessment.
144. Here, the word 'trial' under Section 18(3) of the Act is of extreme importance. The transfer is
made by the Board to the Children's Court only for the purpose of 'trial' and nothing else.
145. It is well settled position in law that in case of 'trial' before the Sessions Court, the trial shall be
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 treated to have commenced when
charges are framed under Section 228 of the CrPC.
146. We have seen hereinabove that under Section 19 of the Act of 2015, after the receipt of
preliminary assessment report, the Children's Court has to decide as to whether there is a need for
'trial' of the child as an adult as per the provisions of the CrPC or there is no need for 'trial' of the
child as an adult. The expression "as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 46
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
used in Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015 refers to applicability of the provisions of
the CrPC in the matter of trial of the child as an adult.
147. Rule 13 of the Rules prescribes procedure in relation to Children's Court and monitoring
authority. Rule 13(7) of the Rules provides that where the Children's Court decides that there is no
need for 'trial' of the child as an adult, shall decide the matter itself and, it may conduct inquiry as if
it were functioning as a Board and dispose of the matter in accordance with the provisions of the Act
and the Rules. However, Rule 13(8) of the Rules provides that Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ)
No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 where the Children's Court decides that there is a need for 'trial' of
the child as an adult, it shall follow the procedure prescribed by the CrPC of 'trial' by Sessions Court
and maintaining a 'child friendly' atmosphere.
148. Thus, Section 18(3) read with Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015 and Rule 13(7) and (8) of the
Rules would make it evident that in case the Children's Court decides that there is a need for 'trial' of
the child as an adult, it shall follow the procedure prescribed by the CrPC of 'trial' by Sessions Court.
149. The CrPC provides four types of trial. They are:-
(i) Trial before a Court of Sessions;
(ii) Trial of warrant cases by Magistrates;
(iii) Trial of summons cases by Magistrate; and
(iv) Summary trials.
150. Sections 225 to 237 deal with warrant cases by a Court of Sessions, Sections 238 to 250 deal
with warrant cases by Court of Magistrates, Sections 251 to 259 provide procedure for 'trial' of
summons cases by Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 Magistrates and
Sections 260 to 265 make provisions relating to summary trials.
151. Under the scheme of the Act of 2015, as far as the Children's Court is concerned, only 'heinous
offences' can be transferred to it for the purposes of 'trial' by the Board. The 'heinous offences'
defined under the Act of 2015 are those, which prescribe minimum punishment of 7 years or more
under the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being in force.
152. Situated, thus, in our view, the scope of application of the provisions of CrPC, after the Board
transfers the 'trial' of the case to the Children's Court to try such offences and the Children's Court
decides that there is a need for 'trial' of the child as an adult, is that while holding the 'trial', the
Children's Court would follow the procedures prescribed in the CrPC for holding trial before a Court
of Sessions. In other words, in course of trial the proceedings prescribed in Chapter XVIII from
Sections 225 to 237 of the CrPC, which deal with trial of warrant cases by Patna High Court CR. APP
(SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 a Court of Sessions would only be applicable while trying a child
as an adult subject to exceptions indicated under the Act of 2015.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 47
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
153. The seventh question for determination is answered, accordingly.
154. Now, what remains to be answered is the the fifth question, i.e., "whether an appeal under
Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 or an application under Section 439 of the CrPC would be
maintainable before the High Court by any person aggrieved by the order granting or rejecting bail
by the Children's Court ?"
155. While considering the above question, we would like to analyse the provisions prescribed in
Section 101 of the Act of 2015.
156. Section 101 of the Act of 2015 deals with appellate jurisdiction under the Act. Section 101(1) of
the Act of 2015 provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, any person aggrieved by an order
of the Board may prefer an appeal before the Children's Court within 30 days from the date of such
order. Thus, the right to appeal is Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
vested with the child in conflict with law, the victim and the State under the aforesaid provision.
157. Proviso to Section 101(1) of the Act of 2015 deals with the power to condone the delay caused in
filing the appeal. It is clarified that Court of Sessions may entertain the appeal even after the expiry
of the said period of 30 days, if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause
from filing the appeal in time and such appeal shall be decided within a period of 30 days. Hence, if
an appeal is preferred after the expiry of the period of 30 days, an application for condonation of
delay in filing the appeal can be filed before the Court of Sessions and not before the Children's
Court. In order to ensure speedy disposal of such an application for condonation of delay, the
proviso states that such an appeal should be decided within a period of 30 days.
158. Section 101(2) of the Act of 2015 makes provision for appeal against the order of the Board
passed under Section 15 of the Act of 2015, after making preliminary assessment into a 'heinous
offence' of a child in Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 conflict with
law. It lays down that an appeal against an order of preliminary assessment shall lie before the Court
of Sessions. It provides that in deciding the appeal against the preliminary assessment findings, the
Court of Sessions may take the assistance of experienced psychologists and medical specialists, but
these psychologists and medical specialists should not be the same whose assistance was availed of
by the Board in making preliminary assessment under the Act of 2015.
159. It is of salience to note that Section 101(2) of the Act of 2015 mentions that an order relating to
transfer of children after preliminary assessment under Section 15 is appealable before the Court of
Sessions meaning thereby that suitability of the child being transferred or not for trial as an adult
can be made by the Court of Sessions at this stage under the appellate jurisdiction. It is further
important to note that even if no appeal is filed and a case is transferred for trial to the Children's
Court by the Board, the Children's Court is mandated to make its own inquiry to determine the
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 suitability of the child to stand trial
as an adult under Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 48
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
160. It is noteworthy that Rule 13 of the Rules has created some confusion regarding forum of
appeal. Rule 13 refers to the 'Children's Court' as the appellate court under Section 101(1) and (2) of
the Act of 2015. Since Rules are subordinate legislation, in case of any conflict with the enabling Act,
the provisions of the Act would prevail. Hence, an appeal against the order of the Board passed after
making preliminary assessment into a 'heinous offence' under Section 15 of the Act of 2015 would be
maintainable before the Court of Sessions and not before the Children's Court.
161. It would be interesting to note here that Section 101(2) of the Act of 2015 does not mention, who
can file the appeal. However, when we give a closer look to Section 15(2) of the Act of 2015, we
notice that the order of the Board to dispose of the matter by itself shall be appealable under the said
provision. This would mean that an order passed by the Board not transferring the child in Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 conflict with law after preliminary
assessment to the Children's Court shall also be appealable under Section 101(2) of the Act of 2015.
Thus, under Section 101(2) of the Act of 2015, against the order passed under Section 15 of the Act
not only a child in conflict with law, but also a victim has been conferred with the right to appeal.
162. Section 101(3) of the Act of 2015 prohibits appeal against an order of acquittal made by the
Board except in case of a child alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence', who has completed or
is above the age of 16 years.
163. Section 101(4) of the Act of 2015 prohibits filing of second appeal from any order of the Court of
Sessions.
164. The term 'appeal' is not defined in the Act of 2015. However, it is well settled position in law
that an appeal is a rehearing by a superior court on both law and fact. In an appeal, the court of
superior jurisdiction determines the question whether the order of the court from which the appeal
is brought was right on the material which Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 the court had before it.
165. Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 provides that any person aggrieved by the order of the
Children's Court may file an appeal before the High Court in accordance with the procedure
specified in the CrPC. Thus, the right to appeal is vested with child in conflict with law, the State and
the victim whosoever is aggrieved by the order of the Children's Court. It is the only provision in the
Act of 2015 under which an aggrieved person can challenge any order, including order granting or
rejecting an application for bail by the Children's Court.
166. Section 1 (4) of the Act of 2015 gives an overriding effect to the Act over any other legislation or
legislative provisions, i.e., inconsistent with it. It states that the provisions of the Act shall apply to
all matters of children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law, including- (i)
apprehension, detention, prosecution, penalty or imprisonment, rehabilitation and social re-
integration of children in conflict with law; (ii) procedures and decisions or orders relating to
rehabilitation, adoption, Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
re-integration, and restoration of children in need of care and protection.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 49
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
167. The non obstante clause gives primacy to the Act in all matters concerning a child in conflict
with law and a child in need of care and protection.
168. In view of non obstante clause, every definition of offence, every punishment and every
procedure, which is inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act of 2015 shall have no effect in
matters concerning a child in conflict with law.
169. Since a right to appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right and is a creature of statute,
there cannot be any right of appeal, unless it is expressly provided in the statute. It is a substantive
right and not merely a procedural right.
170. In view of clear language of the provisions prescribed under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015,
any person aggrieved by the order of the Children's Court may challenge the order by way of an
appeal before the High Court. The phrase 'any order' would also include order Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 granting or rejecting bail.
171. Chapter XXIX in the CrPC containing Sections 372 to 394 deals with the provisions of appeal
arising from any judgment or order of a criminal court. Section 372 of the CrPC provides that no
appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a criminal court except as provided for by the CrPC or
by any other law for the time being in force. There is no provision in Chapter XXIX of the CrPC
enabling any person aggrieved by an order granting or rejecting bail by the Children's Court to file
an appeal during the pendency of the trial.
172. Thus, Section 439 of the CrPC cannot be invoked as an appeal against an order granting or
rejecting bail by the Children's Court.
173. Reference to the words "with the procedure specified in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973"
used in Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 cannot be misconstrued as conferring right
to any person aggrieved by an order granting or rejecting bail by the Children's Court
to file an application for grant of bail under Section 439(1) of Patna High Court CR.
APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 the CrPC or an application for cancellation
of bail under Section 439(2) of the CrPC before the High Court.
174. Since the Act of 2015 provides for an appeal against any order of the Children's Court and the
non obstante clause provision of Section 1(4) of the Act of 2015 gives primacy to the Act, any
application under provisions of the CrPC either for grant of bail under Section 439(1) or for
cancellation of bail under Section 439(2) would be impermissible in law.
175. In the backdrop of the position of law as discussed above, the fifth question for determination is
answered by us holding that against an order granting or refusing bail passed by the Children's
Court, no application for grant of bail under Section 439(1) or for cancellation of bail under Section
439(2) of the CrPC shall lie before the High Court. The remedy open to the person aggrieved under
such circumstances is only an appeal under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/91709862/ 50
Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
176. We are further of the view that the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 'phrase' "in accordance with the procedure specified in the Code of Criminal
Procedure" does not allude to application of the entire CrPC to the Act of 2015. The said reference to
the CrPC in Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 only means that the procedure, and not the substantive
Sections, prescribed under Chapter XXIX shall apply to the appeal that could be filed under the said
Section. To clarify further, the appeal, in terms of Section 101(5) has to be considered on the basis of
material available on the record, i.e., material produced before the Board under Section 13 of the Act
of 2015 and considerations arrived at in terms of Section 12 of the Act of 2015 for the purpose of
grant of bail and not the considerations of grant of bail in terms of Sections 437, 438 and 439 of the
CrPC. The reference in Section 101(5) to "procedure specified in the Code of Criminal Procedure"
does not enlarge the scope of sub-sections to create a substantive right in terms of Section 439 of the
CrPC in Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
177. The fifth question for determination is answered, accordingly.
178. We, thus, sum up the references by holding as under:-
Q. (i). Under which provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age of
16 years and is alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his
application during the pendency of preliminary assessment by the Board under
Section 15 of the Act of 2015?
A. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, a child, who has completed or is above the
age of 16 years and is alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his
application for release on bail under Section 12 of the Act of 2015 during the
pendency of preliminary assessment by the Board under Section 15 of the Act of 2015.
Q. (ii). Under which provision of law, a child, who has completed or is above the age Patna High
Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 of 16 years and is alleged to have committed a
'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail after the transfer of his case to the
Children's Court for trial by the Board ?
A. For the reasons recorded hereinabove, a child, who has completed or is above the age of 16 years
and is alleged to have committed a 'heinous offence' can maintain his application for release on bail
under Section 12 of the Act of 2015 after the transfer of his case to the Children's Court.
Q. (iii). Whether the powers conferred on the Board in the matter of bail to a person, who is
apparently a child alleged to be in conflict with law are also available to the Children's Court ?
A. In view of clear, unambiguous and specific stipulation in Section 8(2) of the Act of 2015, which
provides that the powers conferred on the Board under the Act may also be exercised by the Patna
High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 High Court and the Children's Court in the

matter of grant of bail to a person, who is apparently a child and is alleged to have committed a
bailable or non-bailable offence, the powers conferred on the Board under the Act of 2015 are also
available to the Children's Court and the High Court.
Q. (iv). Whether seriousness of the offence alleged is a ground for rejecting the bail in case of a child
in conflict with law?. A. Seriousness of the offence alleged cannot be made a ground for rejecting bail
under the Act of 2015.
Q. (v). Whether an appeal under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 or an application under Section
439 of the CrPC would be maintainable before the High Court by any person aggrieved by the order
granting or rejecting bail by the Children's Court? A. Against an order granting or refusing bail
passed by the Children's Court, no application for Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019
dt.01-10-2019 bail or cancellation of bail under Section 439(1) or 439(2) of the CrPC shall lie before
the High Court and against such an order only an appeal under Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015
would be maintainable. The 'phrase' "in accordance with the procedure specified in the Code of
Criminal Procedure" does not allude to application of the entire CrPC to the Act of 2015. The said
reference to the CrPC in Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015 only means that the procedure, and not the
substantive Sections, prescribed under Chapter XXIX shall apply to the appeal that could be filed
under the said Section. To clarify further, the appeal, in terms of Section 101(5) has to be considered
on the basis of material available on the record, i.e., material produced before the Board under
Section 13 of the Act of 2015 and considerations arrived at in terms of Section 12 of the Act of 2015
for the purpose of grant of bail and not the considerations of grant of bail in terms of Sections 437,
438 and 439 of the CrPC. Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 The
reference in Section 101(5) to "procedure specified in the Code of Criminal Procedure" does not
enlarge the scope of sub-sections to create a substantive right in terms of Section 439 of the CrPC in
Section 101(5) of the Act of 2015. Q. (vi). What is the scope of Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015 in
connection with the trial of a child as an adult? Whether the provisions of Section 19 of the Act of
2015 are mandatory or the Children's Court has to compulsorily follow the recommendations of the
Board made under Section 15 read with Section 18(3) of the Act of 2015 ?
A. Upon a case of a child having been transferred to the Children's Court, a duty has been cast upon
the Children's Court to further decide about the suitability of the child to be tried as an adult. The
words used in Section 19(1)(i) and 19(1)(ii) of the Act of 2015 give two options to the Children's
Court. First, to try the Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 transferred
child as an adult and second not to deal with child as an adult. The Children's Court is required to
record its reason while arriving at a conclusion whether the child should be treated as child or an
adult in view of Rule 13 (6) of the Rules. In case, the Children's Court decides to deal with child as a
child it has to conduct an inquiry as a Board following the procedures for trial of a summons case in
accordance with the provisions of Section 18 as would appear from the words used in Section
19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015. In case, it decides to try the child as an adult, it shall follow the procedure
as prescribed by the CrPC for the purpose of trial by Sessions Court and pass appropriate orders
after trial without prejudice to the provisions of Sections 19 and 21 of the Act of 2015 considering
special 'needs of the child' the tenets of 'fair trial' and maintaining a 'child friendly' atmosphere as
provided under Section 19(1)(i) of the Act of 2015.

Rajan Kumar vs The State Of Bihar on 30 September, 2019
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019 The provisions of Section 19(1) of the
Act of 2015 are mandatory. The Children's Court cannot dispense with the requirement of deciding
as to whether there is need to try the transferred child as an adult or to deal with the transferred
child as a child.
Q. (vii). What is the scope of application of the provisions of CrPC after the Board transfers the trial
of the case to the Children's Court having jurisdiction to try such offences and the Children's Court
decides that there is a need for trial of the child as an adult?
A. The procedure followed by the Children's Court for trial of a child as an adult would be of a
warrant case and the proceedings in Chapter XVIII prescribed under Sections 225 to 237 of the
CrPC, which deal with warrant cases by a Court of Sessions only would be applicable while trying a
child as an adult, subject to exceptions indicated under the Act of 2015.
Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.2117 of 2019 dt.01-10-2019
