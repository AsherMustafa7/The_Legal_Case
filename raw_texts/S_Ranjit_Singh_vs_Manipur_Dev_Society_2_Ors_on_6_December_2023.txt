petitioner was reinstated in service and his pension was not released by the respondent No.1. The

benefits. Since, no action is taken upon the representations, the petitioner approached this court by

petitioner until conclusion of the criminal proceedings pending against him. It is stated that the
relevant Service Record of the petitioner is in the custody of the CBI and the respondent Nos.1 and 2
are facing problem due to insufficient document.
Mr.Ch.Ngongo, learned senior counsel undertakes that he will furnish necessary documents.
Mr.Albert Keisham, learned counsel for the respondent relies on a judgment of the Kerala High
Court in the case of State of Kerala & Ors Vs Sugunan V: 2019 Legal Eagle (KER) 603:
2019 (2) KerLJ 302 wherein it is held that the entire retiral benefit cannot be granted
to the retired government servant during pendency of the criminal case in Vigilance
Court. Treating parity with the present case, the respondents proposed to grant only
provisional pension without gratuity as provided in Rule 69 (c) of the CCS (Pension)
Rules.
Mr.Ch.Ngongo, learned counsel for the petitioner points out that no criminal case is
pending against the petitioner before any Court. It is only an FIR under investigation
of the CBI. Hence, clause (3) of Rule 69 of the CCS (Pension) Rules will not be
applicable.
Mr.Phungyo Zinkhai, learned Government Advocate submits that the issue is
between the petitioner and the respondent Nos.1 and 2, the State respondent has no
role and this Court may pass appropriate order.
This Court considered the materials on record and submissions made by the parties
at the Bar. It will be proper to consider the provisions of Section 69 of the CCS
(Pension) Rules, 1972 and the same is reproduced herein below.
"69. Provisional pension where departmental or judicial proceedings may be pending
(1) (a) In respect of a Government servant referred to in sub-rule (4) of Rule 9, the
Accounts Officer shall authorize the provisional pension equal to the maximum
pension which would have been admissible on the basis of qualifying service up to the
date of retirement of the Government servant, or if he was under suspension on the
date of retirement up to the date immediately preceding the date on which he was
placed under suspension.
(b) the provisional pension shall be authorized by the Accounts Officer during the
period commencing from the date of retirement up to and including the date on
which after the conclusion of departmental or judicial proceedings, final orders are

S.Ranjit Singh vs Manipur Dev Society & 2 Ors on 6 December, 2023
On plain reading of Rule 69, it is clear that during pendency of the departmental or
judicial proceeding it is permitted to grant provisional pension to the retired
government employee. Admittedly, the departmental proceeding has been quashed
by the order of this Court and it is only a charge sheet/final report under Section 183
of the CPC has not been filed by the CBI.
It is settled proposition of law that a criminal proceeding is initiated upon taking
cognizance by a competent Court upon filing of the final report/charge sheet by the
investigation. In the present case, the matter is still under investigation and final
report/charge sheet as contemplated under Section 173 is yet to be filed. Hence, no
judicial proceeding is pending against the petitioner before any competent criminal
court. Admittedly, a criminal investigation is pending against the petitioner and this
Court is of the view that provisions of Section (c) of Rule 69 of the CCS (Pension)
Rules will not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
Accordingly, the writ petition is allowed. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 are directed to
release the pensionary benefit including gratuity of the petitioner upon submission of
requisite paper, if any, within two months of submission of additional documents, if
any, by the petitioner. It is also clarified that the respondent Nos.1 and 2 may request
the CBI for providing necessary documents with respect to the preparation of
Pension Payment Authority and other benefits for the petitioner. On such request,
the CBI is also directed to prepare the same within a period of one month.
With these observations, the writ petition is disposed of. No cost.
Furnish a copy of this order to learned counsel appearing for the parties.
