ORDER
(Jabalpur, dtd.14.9.2021) Per : Vijay Kumar Shukla, J.-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 5
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
Regard being had to the similitude of prayers and considering the commonality of issues exposited
in these writ petitions, they were heard analogously and are being disposed of by a common order.
2. The issue involved in these writ petitions is that, whether two Degrees obtained simultaneously,
during the same academic year, can be considered for employment purposes, particularly, for being
selected to a post under the M.P. School Education Service (Teaching Cadre) Service Conditions and
Recruitment Rules, 2018 ?
3. For the sake of clarity and convenience the facts adumbrated in W.P. No.9301/2020 (Poonam
Pandey vs. State of M.P. and others) are noted.
4. An advertisement was issued by the Professional Examination Board, Madhya Pradesh (Vyapam)
in the month of September, 2018 for conducting Teacher Eligibility Test - 2018 for recruitment of
teachers in High Schools in the State of Madhya Pradesh for various subjects. The State of Madhya
Pradesh enacted the M.P. School Education Service (Teaching Cadre) Service Conditions and
Recruitment Rules, 2018 [hereinafter referred to as "Rules 2018"]. The M.P. Professional
Examination Board also issued a Booklet regarding Conduction of Examination and Selection under
the School Education Department for High School Teacher Eligibility Test, 2018.
5. The petitioner filled-up the prescribed form in the subject of Biology after payment of requisite
fees. In the application form the petitioner has clearly specified the year of both Degrees, i.e., M.Sc.
(Zoology) from M.P. Bhoj (Open) University and B.Ed. from the Kurukshetra University, as 2010.
The petitioner had completed the M.Sc. (Zoology) course from the M.P. Bhoj (Open) University
under Open and Distance Learning during the period September-October 2008 to
September-October 2010. The examinations of M.Sc. First Year were conducted in September-
October 2009 and those of M.Sc. Second Year in September- October 2010. The petitioner took
admission in Keshav College of Education under the Kurukshetra University, as a regular student in
June, 2009 for one year B.Ed. Course and appeared in the B.Ed. Examination during June, 2010.
She appeared in the examination on 03-02-2019 at B.V.M. College of Management, Centre - 1,
Yamuna Nagar, Gwalior. The result of the High School Eligibility Test, 2018 was declared on
29-8-2019. The petitioner secured 100.72 marks in the Examination with the consolidated
position/rank of 115.
6. It is setforth that the advertisement was issued by the M.P. Professional Examination Board,
Madhya Pradesh under the Rules 2018 for conducting Teacher Eligibility Test - 2018 for
recruitment of teachers in High Schools in the State of M.P. in various subjects. The educational
qualification required was under
Schedule III of the Rules 2018. As per Scheduled III the requisite educational
qualification for High School teacher is Master's Degree in the relevant subject with
Second Division and Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) or its equivalent. So the requisite
educational qualification provides for two Degrees, one should be Master's Degree
and the other B.Ed. or its equivalent.

Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
7. The State of Madhya Pradesh in exercise of power conferred under Article 309 of the Constitution
of India, framed the Rules 2018, which provides the manner, method and process pertaining to
service conditions and recruitment for the M.P. School Education Service Teacher cadre. It further
provides for eligibility and disqualification of the candidates appearing and applying for various
posts of High School teachers. It is asseverated that the disqualification which has been provided in
the impugned communication, dated 22-6-2020, that a candidate who possesses two Degrees in one
Academic Year, will be disqualified, was not provided in the parent Rules 2018, however after
completion of whole selection process this disqualification is issued by the impugned order dated
22-6-2020, which per se, is illegal and arbitrary.
8. It is vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Rules and Instructions
Booklet published by the Professional Examination Board provides essential qualifications and
disqualification of the candidates, but no such disqualification as described in the impugned
communication dated 22-6-2020, is provided in the Booklet.
9. The Directorate of Public Instructions, Bhopal published the documents verification schedule in
its Official website for Uchh Madhyamik Shikshak (High School Teacher) for all qualified candidates
on 23-6-2020. The documents verification was to commence from 01-7-2020 and continued till
17-7-2020 in various districts of Madhya Pradesh depending on number of students in each district.
The final selection list was supposed to be published by last week of July, 2020. Counselling of the
petitioner was scheduled on 9-7-2020, but it was postponed and was finally conducted on
12-4-2021, whereby candidature of the petitioner was put on hold.
10. It is contended that when the petitioner was to attend the counselling after successfully securing
115th position in the selection process, the respondents have issued the impugned order dated 23-6-
2020, wherein it is prescribed that the candidates who are having two Degrees simultaneously in
one academic year, would not be eligible. The aforesaid order has been assailed on the ground that it
runs counter to the Rules 2018, which does not provide any such disqualification. The learned
counsel appearing for the petitioner commended us to the Apex Court decision rendered in the case
of State of Karnataka vs. H. Ganesh Kamath reported in AIR 1983 SC 550, wherein it held that it is
well settled principle of interpretation of statutes, that the conferment of rule-making power by an
Act, does not enable the rule-making authority to make a rule which travels beyond the scope of the
enabling Act or which is inconsistent therewith or repugnant thereto. Thus, the bone contention of
the petitioner is that the impugned order dated 23-6- 2020 is contrary to the Rules 2018.
11. Rule 9 of the Rules 2018 governs disqualification and Sub-rule (4) of Rule 9 provides that the
provision of M.P. Civil Services (General Conditions of Service) Rules, 1961 and all other
disqualifications notified by the Government from time to time, shall be applicable to the
candidates. Thus, it is contended that no such disqualification of two Degrees obtained
simultaneously, during the same academic year, has been notified by the Government in its Official
Gazette. It is argued that as per Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018, the word "notified" as per Law Lexicon
Dictionary authored by P. Ramanatha Iyer, means "notified in an official gazette". It is further
propounded by the learned counsel for the petitioner that taking resort to Section 23 of the M.P.
General Clauses Act, 1957 would go to show that, if any order or publication is required to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 7
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
notified, then it will be deemed to be notified only when it is published in the Official Gazette. It is
assiduously urged that even though the word "notified" is appearing in Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018,
but it does not provide to be published in the Official Gazette, because the same is provided in the
M.P. General Clauses Act that an order which is required to be notified, has to be mandatorily
published in the Official Gazette. It is argued that Section 23 of the M.P. General Clauses Act, 1957
provides only for the Madhya Pradesh Acts or any Rules made thereunder, is also not available with
the State Government, because the Rules 2018 has been formulated directly under Article 309 of the
Constitution of India which is parent of all the Acts and Rules throughout the country.
12. To substantiate the aforesaid submissions, the learned counsel for the petitioner has placed
heavy reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court Court rendered in the case of Rajendra
Agricultural University vs. Ashok Kumar Prasad and others, (2010) 1 SCC 730, wherein Section 36
of Bihar Agricultural Universities Act, 1987 and Section 28 of Bihar and Orissa General Clauses Act,
1917 were interpreted, which is pari materia to Section 23 of the M.P. General Clauses Act, 1957. In
para 17 of the said judgment it is held that the provision contained in Section 36(4) of Bihar
Agricultural Universities Act, requiring publication of statutes in the Official Gazette, has to be
treated mandatory. It is strenuously urged that although in Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018 the words
"to be published in Official Gazette" are not appearing but the word "notified" is clearly appearing,
and with the aid of Section 23 of the M.P. General Clauses Act, 1957 comes into play and the
impugned communication dated 22-6-2020 was required to be mandatorily published in the Official
Gazette.
13. The learned counsel for the petitioner further commended us to the decision of the Apex Court
rendered in the case of ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards vs. Mandal Revenue Officer, (1996) 6 SCC
634, wherein it is held that the object of publication in the Official Gazette is not merely to give
information to public. Official Gazette as the very name indicates, is an official document. It is
published under the authority of the Government. Publication of an Order or Rule in the Official
Gazette is final. Reliance is further placed on the decision rendered in the case of Sambhanath Jha
vs. Kedar Prasad Sinha, (1972) 1 SCC 573, which says that the requirement of publication in the
Gazette is an imperative requirement and cannot be dispensed with.
The learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to a Division Bench decision of this Court
rendered in the case of State of M.P. vs. Fazal Hussain Ranabali Bohra, AIR 1968 MP 138 (DB),
wherein it is observed that the word "notified" appearing in Rule 2(3) of the Defence of India Rule
would mean notified in the Official Gazette.
14. Thus, the first plank of submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that, since the
impugned order dated 22- 6-2020 has not been notified as disqualification by the Government in
terms of the Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018, therefore, the aforesaid Rule could not have been operated
against the petitioner. It is further canvassed that there is no bar, if a person pursues two Degree
Courses in one academic year, but the one Degree should be through Distance Learning Mode and
another as regular. It is assiduously urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner that she
underwent the B.Ed. Course from the Kurukshetra University and M.Sc. (Zoology) from M.P. Bhoj
(Open) University under Open and Distance Learning. Pursuing two Degrees, out of which one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 8
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
through Distance Learning never had been a bar and till date, students are pursuing two Courses
simultaneously, but one through Distance Learning Programme. It is argued that the students are
allowed to pursue two regular courses in one academic year, but this is not the case here, because
the petitioner has pursued one regular course and the other through Distance Learning programme.
15. A reference is made to the University Grant Commission (UGC) meeting dated 29-10-2012,
which took the decision that a student enrolled in a Degree programme under regular mode, may be
allowed to pursue a maximum of one additional Degree Programme simultaneously, under
Open/Distance Learning mode from the same or a different University. But, they did not allow two
Degree programmes under regular mode. Thereafter, the UGC issued a public notice dated
15-01-2016 to the effect that they do not endorse the idea of allowing the students to pursue two
Degrees simultaneously. Thereafter, a Press statement was also issued by the Secretary, UGC, which
was published in the Times of India newspaper on 30-6-2020, stating that a decision has been taken
to allow the students to pursue two Degrees simultaneously, but for both Degrees the mode of
delivery will be different. A student pursuing a regular degree can pursue a second degree only via
Open Distance Learning (ODL) or Oneline mode.
16. On the basis of the aforesaid factual assertions, it is contended that the previous view of the
UGC, vide Public Notice dated 15-01-2016, has also been relied upon by the State Government in
their counter reply and the same has been superseded by 546th Meeting of the UGC convened on
14-5-2020. The UGC has also forwarded its decision to the Ministry of Human Resources
Development. A further reference is made to the Public Notice, dated 15-01-2016 published by the
UGC, wherein they did not endorse the idea, allowing the students to pursue two degrees
simultaneously. But, in this public notice it was not clear, whether it was for two regular Degrees or
one regular Degree and one Open Distance. It is canvassed that the Distance Learning Courses do
not require any mandatory attendance and it has altogether different mode of learning, which is
provided in Clause 3 of the UGC Regulations 1985 for Distance Education and its examinations are
also conducted as per Clause 4 of the said Regulations.
17. It is urged that in the obtaining factual matrix, it can be inferred that so far as the Public Notice
dated 15-01-2016 is concerned, which is based on Bachelor Degree and Master Degree, Regulation
2003, is actually for two regular Degrees acquired simultaneously, and not for one Regular and
another through Open Distance mode. It is contended that some of the candidates, who were
selected in the year 2012-13 out of which some of them, who have pursued two Degrees
simultaneously, had been considered for Samviliyan.
18. The respondents have filed reply and submitted that the recruitment process was conducted
under the Rules 2018. Rule 8 of the Rules 2018 prescribes condition of eligibility for direct
recruitment. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 8 provides educational qualification which is prescribed in Column
5 of Schedule III. As per Column 5 of Schedule III, educational qualification for the post of Uchcha
Madhyamik Shikshak is Master Degree in the relevant subject with second division and B.Ed or its
equivalent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 9
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
19. In the Recruitment Rules 2018 for educational qualifications the word "Degree" has been
specifically mentioned. The Degree which is issued by the University can be said as valid degree
when it fulfils the terms and conditions and guidelines issued by the UGC, which is a Regulatory
Authority. Obtaining a valid degree for recruitment is inclusive in the educational qualification
prescribed under Rules 2018. The UGC has issued a public notice on 15-01-2016 stating that they do
not endorse an idea of allowing the students to pursue two Degrees simultaneously. Therefore, two
Degrees obtained by the petitioner simultaneously, cannot be said as valid degree and the petitioner
cannot be declared qualified for appointment on the post in question, on the basis of invalid degree.
It is argued that by the impugned order dated 23-6-2020 the respondents have not prescribed any
disqualification.
20. The respondents have commended us to a Full Bench judgment of the High Court of Judicature
at Madras passed in W.P. No.2807/2014 (R. Chitra and others vs. Member Secretary, Government
of Tamil Nadu Teachers' Recruitment Board, Chennai and others), wherein a similar issue has been
considered and decided against the candidates.
21. It is assiduously urged that as per Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018 the disqualification notified by the
Government from time to time, shall be applicable to the candidates. Section 23 of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 is not applicable in the present case, because the same is applicable to making
rules and bye-laws, whereby any Act or Regulation empowers to make rules or bye-laws is expressed
to be given, subject to the condition that the rules or bye-laws be made final after previous
publications.
22. The Rules 2018 have been formulated under the proviso of Article 309 of the Constitution of
India, which confers the power to the State Government to notify disqualifications. The word
"notified" cannot be taken in a sense that the State Government is required to publish all other
disqualifications in the Official Gazette. The word "notified" used in Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018 has
not been defined under the Rules. Therefore, the dictionary meaning of the word should be
ascertained for construing the true meaning of the word.
23. The learned counsel for the respondents has further relied on the judgment passed by this Court
in the case of Desha Singh, through L.Rs. By Ram Pyari Bai Wd/o Desha Singh and another vs.
Madanlal son of Dalumal, reported in 1992 MPLJ 95, wherein it is held that when the meaning of
the word "notified" is not defined under the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961, then in such
circumstances, a resort should be made to the dictionary meaning of the word. As per Concise
Oxford Dictionary the word "notify" means - inform or give notice to (a person), make known;
announce or report (a thing).
24. The learned counsel for the respondents urged with vehemence that the issue involved in the
present case is squarely covered by the Full Bench judgment of the Madras High Court rendered in
the case of R. Chitra and others (supra).
25. The University Grant Commission has filed a short return in the matter and stated that the
aforesaid decision has been submitted for concurrence of the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 10
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
and once approval is granted, it would issue appropriate notification to that effect. Thus, there is no
final decision by the UGC in the matter.
26. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and bestowed our anxious
consideration on their respective arguments advanced.
27. In the present batch of writ petitions, propriety of the impugned order dated 23-6-2020 has
been assailed mainly on following grounds :
(i) The impugned order has not been notified in terms of Rule 9(4) of the Rules 2018, which requires
disqualification to be notified by the Government from time to time, and the same shall be made
applicable to the candidates.
Reliance has been placed in Clause 23 of the M.P. General Clauses Act, 1957 contending that the
disqualification debarring the candidates, who have secured two Degrees simultaneously, in the
same academic year, has to be notified in the Official Gazette.
(ii) The Rules 2018 does not provide any such disqualification of the candidate or his candidature on
the ground that the candidate is possessing two degrees simultaneously, in one academic session.
(iii) The petitioners have not undertaken two regular Degree Courses and in fact, they have done one
as regular Degree and the other through Open Distance Learning Programme and this type of
situation has been accepted by the UGC in its Press Release dated 22-5-2020.
(iv) The Rules 2018, till the latest instructions dated 10-01-2020 issued by the respondents, does not
provide for any such disqualification, and at the fag end of selection process when counselling is
about to commence issuance of the impugned order is illegal.
(v) The impugned order is contrary to the Rules 2018 and the same has been passed in violation of
the Articles 16 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
(vi) Merely by executive instructions the respondents cannot bypass the Rules 2018 and if that being
so, the impugned order is perverse. There is no disqualification of such kind attached with the Rule
9 of the Rules 2018 and when the Rules 2018 does not provide for such disqualification, the State
Government does not have the authority to issue conditions for disqualification of the candidates.
28. Regard being had to the arguments advanced on behalf of the parties and having perused the
records, it is luminescent that the recruitment process was conducted under the Rules 2018. The
Rule 8 of the Rules 2018 prescribes condition of eligibility for direct recruitment. Sub-rule (2) of
Rule 8 contemplates educational qualification which is prescribed under Column 5 of Schedule III.
As per Column 5 of Schedule III, educational qualification for the post of Uchcha Madhyamik
Shikshak is Master Degree in relevant subject with Second Division and B.Ed or its equivalent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/81682994/ 11
Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
29. In the Recruitment Rules 2018, for educational qualification, the word "Degree" has been
specifically mentioned. The Degree which is issued by the University can be said as a valid degree
when it fulfils the terms, conditions and guidelines issued by the UGC, which is a Regulatory
Authority. Obtaining a valid degree for recruitment is inclusive in the educational qualification as
prescribed under the Rules 2018.
30. The UGC has issued a public notice on 15-01-2016 stating that they do not endorse the idea,
allowing the students to pursue two Degrees simultaneously. Since, the UGC which is a Regulatory
Authority, has not approved the idea, allowing the students to pursue two Degrees simultaneously,
therefore, two Degrees obtained by the petitioners simultaneously, cannot be said to be valid and the
petitioners cannot be declared qualified for appointment on the post in question, on the basis of
invalid degrees. It cannot be inferred that the respondents have prescribed a new disqualification by
the impugned order dated 23-6-2020. In fact, the said order is clarificatory in nature and does not
run contrary to the Rules 2018 or the Booklet of the Professional Examination Board.
31. The issue which has cropped up for consideration in the present case - Whether two Degrees
(dual Degrees) obtained simultaneously, during the same academic year, can be considered for
employment purpose, particularly for being selected to a post under the Rules 2018, has come up for
consideration before the Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras in the case of R.
Chitra and others (supra), wherein the UGC has taken the stand that earlier it had allowed the
students to pursue dual Degree courses. However, recently after consulting with the educational
bodies and considering various representations from the general public as well as educational
agencies, the earlier view of the UGC was reviewed by an expert committee. Now the UGC has taken
a decision to allow the students to pursue dual Degree courses simultaneously, one through a
regular stream as full-time course and the other through Distance Education mode or an Open
University or Online in the same academic year. However, the second Degree should be of the same
level or of the lower level of the full-time academic programme. The UGC also stated that the
aforesaid decision of the UGC has been submitted for concurrence of the Ministry of Education,
Government of India, and once the approval is granted the UGC would issue appropriate
notification to that effect.
32. The Full Bench of the Madras High Court in R. Chitra and others (supra), considering the
aforesaid stand of the UGC ruled thus :
"Unless the dual degrees obtained simultaneously, in the same academic year, is recognized, a
candidate cannot seek for a direction to the appointing authority to select and appoint him/her to a
particular post. Incidentally, the Division Bench has also held that unless a specific direction is
issued by the UGC in the form of Statutory notification, mere recommendation of the UGC
approving the proposal to permit the students to pursue two degrees simultaneously, in the same
academic year, have only a recommendatory value. As stated earlier, unless and until, the UGC
recognizes such degree courses, there is no obligation on the part of the University or the
employers/recruiting agencies, to recognize such degree courses in the absence of any such rules in
this regard."

Shyam Sunder Patidar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 14 September, 2021
33. As regards publication of notification in the Official Gazette, being an essential requirement for
prescribing disqualification, it is to be noted that by the impugned order dated 23-6-2020, no new
disqualification was prescribed, because securing appointment on the basis of Degree is inclusive
under the Rules 2018. Moreover, Section 23 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is not applicable in the
present case, because the same is applicable for making of Rules and bye-laws, where any Act or
Regulation empowers to make Rules or Bye-laws is expressed to be given to the condition of the
Rules or bye-laws being made after previous publications. If any Rules or Regulations is made under
any Act, then it has to be published in the Official Gazette and, therefore, the decisions relied upon
by the learned counsel for the petitioners would not apply to the facts of the present case.
34. In the present case, no new rules or bye-laws have been framed which are required to be
published in the Official Gazette. Rules 2018 have been made under the proviso of Article 309 of the
Constitution of India, which confers power to the State Government to notify the disqualification.
The word "notified" cannot be taken in a sense that the State Government is required to publish all
other disqualifications in the Official Gazette. The word "notified" used in Rule 9(4) of the Rules
2018, has not been defined under the Rules 2018 and, therefore, dictionary meaning of the word
should be adopted for construing the true meaning of the word. In the case at hand, since the
impugned order dated 23-6-2020 was issued subsequently and is official in nature and no new
disqualification was prescribed, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners
that in absence of publication of notification in the Official Gazette of the impugned order dated
23-6-2020 has no legal sanctity, does not merit consideration and the same being sans substratum,
deserves to be repelled.
35. In the case of Desha Singh through LRs (supra) where this Court has taken the view that the
word "notified" is not defined under the M.P. Accommodation Control Act, 1961, in such
circumstances, resort should be taken to the dictionary meaning of the word and as per Concise
Oxford Dictionary, the word "notify" means - inform or give notice to (a person), make known;
announce or report (a thing).
36. In the conspectus of the aforesaid discussions, we do not perceive any illegality in the impugned
order dated 23-6-2020 warranting any interference in writ jurisdiction. Accordingly, the writ
petitions being sans merits, are dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
