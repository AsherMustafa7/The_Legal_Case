petitioner being aggrieved by the Order dated 21.06.2002 passed by the Member,
Board of Revenue, Odisha, Cuttack in OMT (VOA) Appeal Case No.1 of 2000,
wherein the Order dated 03.06.1999 and Order dated 15.01.2000 passed by the
Tahasildar, Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Conversion Case No.15/73 and Order dated
09.06.2000 passed by the Collector, Sonepur in VOA Appeal No.1 of 2000 were set
aside and the disputed land was directed to be recorded in Government Khata by
restoring to State Government for distribution among landless persons, this civil
revision petition has been filed by the petitioners with the following prayer:
"It is therefore prayed that your Lordship(cid:128)s may graciously be pleased to admit, call
for the record and after hearing the parties the impugned order may kindly be set
aside and the revision petition be allowed.
And for this act of kindness, the petitioner shall, as in duty bound ever pray."
Facts:
2. The sequence of events as adumbrated by the petitioners emanate that the
disputed "Bhogra lands" in the present Revision Petition with Holding No.4, Plot
No.1,5,2/58, 5/57 and 10 measuring an area Ac.3.600 decimal and Holding No. Plot
Nos.8, 45 and 39 measuring an Area Ac.27.280 decimal of Village Narasinghpur
under Sonepur Police Station were attached to the office of village holder, namely,
Balamukunda Dani under Jamindar Ruturaj Kunar.
2.1. On the land being surrendered on 03.12.1935 by land holder, Zamindar Ruturaj
Kunar inducted Gokula Sahu as tenant the entire disputed land and by virtue of a
registered document continued to possess the said lands and paid rent to the then
Zamindar and obtained rent receipt.
2.2. Due to mismanagement the disputed property were placed under the
management of Court of Wards and the then Sub-Divisional Officer, who was the
Estate Collector, remained under the management of the entire estate. The Estate
Collector had given lease of such lands to Gokula Sahu and his brother Nakula Sahu.
The disputed lands were acquired in the name of Gokula Sahu by virtue of Registered
document dated 30.06.1945 on behalf of the joint family. The lands were released
from the Court of Wards in the year 1984.

Ashish Kumar Sahu vs C.R.P. No.17 Of 2009 Page 1 Of 25 on 19 February, 2025
2.3. The Government on 02.02.1956 by virtue of press notice abolished the "Bhogra
lands" with effect from 01.04.1955, wherein it is reflected that the person in
possession of land on Raiyati basis would be entitled for the possession of the said
land. Though the disputed lands were Bhogra lands, the proceedings were dropped as
the estate was under the management of the Courts of Wards.
2.4. An OMTVD Case No.15 of 1973 was commenced on account of introduction of
the Odisha Merged Territories (Village Offices Abolition) Act, 1963. In the year 1984,
the Estate, being released from the Court of Wards, an order was passed by the
authority to distribute the said lands among the landless persons vide Lease Case
Nos.2 of 1984 and 1 of 1986.
2.5. Therefore, the present petitioners approached before the learned Civil Judge,
(Senior Division), Sonepur by filing T.S. No.59 of 1994 challenging the order passed
by the Collector, Bolangir as well as the Tahasildar in said Lease Case, which was
decreed on 04.08.1995 with following findings:
"The suit be and the same is decreed exparte against the defendants without cost. It is
further decreed the order passed by defendant-2 in Misc. Case 2/84 and Misc. Case
No.1 of 1986 relating to the suit lands is hereby declared as illegal and inoperative
and the defendants are hereby directed for fresh disposal of the O.M.T. Case
No.15/73 afresh in accordance with the statutory act and rules of O.M.T. Act. The
defendants are further injuncted from entering upon the suit lands and distributing
any portion thereof until the disposal of the O.M.T. Case No.15 of 1973 in deciding
the claims of the plaintiff and others, if any, afresh."
2.6. After due enquiry and observation, the Tahasildar, Sonepur vide Order dated 03.06.1999 in
OMT(VOA) Case No.15 of 1973 settled the disputed land in favour of the Nakula Sahu and referred
the same to the Collector under the Odisha Government Land Settlement Act, 1962 for divesting of
the disputed land. The learned Additional District Magistrate, Sonepur vide Letter No.1600 dated
22.10.1999 made observation that the said case was not covered under the provision of the Odisha
Government Land Settlement Act. Therefore, directed the Tahasildar to proceed under the Odisha
Merged Territories (Village Office Abolition) Act.
2.7. Pursuant to the said Letter dated 22.10.1999, the Tahasildar vide Order dated 15.01.2009
corrected the Record-of-Right (RoR) in favour of Nakula Sahu.
2.8. The opposite parties filed grievance petition before the Collector on 15.01.2000 on the
allegation that they are in possession since 28 years. Therefore, the Collector, Sonepur treated the
grievance petition as Odisha Merged Territories (Village Office Abolition) Appeal No.01 of 2000 and
vide Order dated 09.06.2000 and set aside the Order passed by the Tahasildar. The following order
was passed in the said Appeal:

"*** Orders dated 03.06.1999 passed by the Tahasildar, Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Case
No.15 of 1973 shows that he has not properly weighed the evidence adduced by the
Respondent. Except notice (Ext-7), no other documents was filed to prove his actual
physical possession of the land. The Tahasildar has not properly appreciated the
provisions of OMT (VOA) Act, 1963. (Section 3 & 5) and not proceeded as per the
Rules prescribed for the purpose of OMT (VOA) Rules, 1963.
The land was under the management of Court of Wards till 1984. Finally it was
released from the control and management of Court of wards from 21.2.1984 for
distribution of the Bhogra land among the land less persons of the village by the
Govt. in Revenue and Excise Department, Orissa, Bhubaneswar vide Letter
No.12435/RE. dated 21.02.1984 as per Memo No.800/Rev., Dated 08.03.1984 of
OSD (DP) Balangir.
As per decision of the Hon(cid:128)ble Court in T.S. No.59/94 the defendants are injuncted
until the disposal of the OMT (VOA) Case No.15 of 1973 in deciding the claims of the
plaintiff and others if any. In other words after deciding the claim of the Respondent,
Nakula Sahu and others, if they are entitled under the OMT (VOA) Act and Rules the
injunction order restraining the Tahasildar for distribution of the Bhogra land among
the land less people of the village is automatically vacated.
In view of the above, the Orders dated 03.06.1999 and all subsequent orders passed by the
Tahasildar, Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Case No.15 of 1973 is set-aside. Case remanded to the
Tahasildar, Sonepur for fresh hearing and disposal of the case strictly conforming the provisions of
the OMT (VOA) Act & Rules, 1963.
In case the Tahasildar fails to find out whether the Nakula Sahu was the village holder or not, he
shall bring it to the notice of the Collector for a decision.
Send back the L.C.Rs. Pronounced the orders in open court on this day dated the 9th June, 2000. "
2.9. Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 09.06.2000 passed by the Collector,
Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Appeal No.01 of 2000, the petitioners approached the
Member, Board of Revenue for setting aside the Order of the Collector as well as the
Tahasildar by way of Appeal under Section 13(2) of the Odisha Merged Territories
(Village Offices Abolition) Act, 1963, which was disposed of vide Order dated
21.06.2002 with the following observation:
"13. *** So the land (without mention of any area) has been allotted on lease basis
only to raise khariff crops. After the crop was over, the present appellant was directed
to return the lands to the Government. This Conditional temporary lease can not
create any right, title and interest of the lessee. Besides the possession for khariff
crop, the present appellant fails to produce any evidence regarding his claim for
possession of the suit land, during subsequent years. A tenant possessing land on

contract basis from 30.11.72 to 2.12.72 and if he claimed for settlement as he was in
possession on the cuttoff date, 1.12.72, then that possession cannot be accepted for
settlement of the land as the aim of legislature by enacting the VOA Act is to release
the tenants from the Gountias those were in possession of the particular land for a
longtime and developed the lands for agricultural purposes in the context can be held
that the possession of the present appellant is not established. The Hon(cid:128)ble Full
Bench in the case as described earlier at page 231 has also held as follows:
„The moment the Bhogra lands vested in the state under Section 3(f) the Village
Officer had no right to possess the land. There would be a time lag between the
declaration and actual delivery of possession. During the intervening period the
Village Officer or any other person might be actually continuing in possession of the
Bhogra lands. But such actual physical possession is not on the basis of any right to
possess. On vesting the title and the right to possess are extinguished.(cid:128) When the
estate has been vested with the State Government during the year 1955 through the
press note, the temporary conditional possession for a short period by way of lease
during 1972-73 can not create any right, title and interest of the present appellant.
14. In the circumstances, Order dated 03.06.1999 and 15.01.2000 of Tahasildar,
Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Conversion Case No.15 of 1973 and Order dated 09.06.2000
of Collector, Sonepur in VOA Appeal No.1 of 2000 are set aside. The lands be
recorded in Government for distribution among landless persons.
15. The Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
16. Pronounced the order in open court on this, the 21st day of June, 2002."
2.10. Still dissatisfied, with a prayer to quash Order dated 21.06.2002, the petitioners approached
this Court by way of this Civil Revision Petition invoking under Section 13(3)(a) of the Odisha
Merged Territories (Village Offices Abolition) Act, 1963.

33. Procedure to be followed by Board of Revenue while proceeding under provisions of the Act.--
The filing hearing and disposal of petitions of appeal or revision before the Board of Revenue shall
be regulated by the provisions of the Board of Revenue Orissa Regulations, 1963."
Consideration of argument of learned counsel for the petitioner:
6. In course of hearing, Sri Amit Prasad Bose, learned Advocate confined his
argument to the following question of law as raised in the petition:
"For that it reveals from the impugned order itself that a pure question of law was
raised before the second appellate authority that whether the 1st appellate authority
has jurisdiction to treat a grievance petition as an appeal in the absence of any suo
motu power of appeal conferred by the statute but there is neither any discussion nor
any finding to that effect by the second appellate court, as such impugned order is
against law and liable to be set aside."
6.1. The Order dated 09.06.2000 of the Collector, Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Appeal No.1 of 2000
reveals as follows:
"The landless S.C. people of Village Baidyanath filed a grievance petition before the
Collector to. conduct an enquiry regarding the illegal settlement of 32 Acres of waste
land of Mouza: Narasinghgarh which was under
the management of Court of Wards in favour of one Nakita Sahu of village:
Baidyanath. To examine the validity of the settlement orders passed by the
Tahasildar, Sonepur in OMT (VOA) Case No. 15 of 1973 in favour of Nakula Sahu of
village Baidyanath, it was converted to an appeal Case under Section 13(1) of the
OMT (VOA) Act, 1963."
6.2. Against such order of the Collector, the petitioners have raised the question of law before the
Board of Revenue in OMT (VOA) Case No.1 of 2000 (Nakula Sahoo Vrs. Kantha Suna and others).
As it appears objection has been raised with respect to non-adherence to mandate prescribed under
Rule 32(2) of the OMT (VOA) Rules. It has been held in such context by the Board of Revenue at
paragraph 10 of the impugned Order dated 21.06.2002 of the Board of Revenue as follows:
"10. Shri Mishra, Advocate for the Appellant further submitted that the admission
and adjudication of Appeal No.1 of 2000 by Collector, Sonepur contravenes the
provisions of Rule 32(2)(a) of the VOA Rules. Rule 32(2)(a) provides for filing an
appeal along with a copy of order appealed against. Appeal No.1 of 2000 of Collector,
Sonepur reveals that no certified copy of the order of the trial Court had been
enclosed with the application of the present opposite parties or no reasons thereof
explained in the application of Appeal No.1/2000. Thus it was not proper for the
Collector to go ahead with the Appeal Case. In the fitness of things, the appellants

should have been advised to refile the appeal with the requisite documents."
6.3. Having thus observed, the Board of Revenue should not have proceeded to decide the second
appeal under Section 13(2) of the OMT (VOA) Act on merits. When it is the observation that the
appeal under Section 13(1) was incompetent, the Board of Revenue ought not to have delved into
merit of the matter.
6.4. Conjoint reading of Section 13 of the OMV (VOA) Act and Rule 32 of the OMV (VOA) Rules with
the observations made in the Order dated 09.06.2000 of the Collector, Sonepur and the Order dated
21.06.2002 would go to show that the procedure envisaged in the provisions are not followed.
6.5. It is deserved to be observed that if remedy is made available for aggrieved party by way of an
appeal, the same is to be filed in accordance with provisions of the statute. It is trite that appeal is
statutory remedy and could be subject to conditions. Therefore, as it transpires from the Order
dated 21.06.2002 of the Board of Revenue, the appeal has not been filed in the manner prescribed
under Rule 32 of the OMT (VOA) Rules, 1963.
Conclusion:
7. Since it is already observed that on the face of the impugned Order, the Board of Revenue has
made observation that the appeal filed before the Collector, Sonepur was not in order in terms of
Rule 32 of the OMT (VOA) Rules, this Court is, therefore, of the opinion that the Order dated
21.06.2002 of the Board of Revenue suffers legal infirmity and in exercise of power under Section
13(3) of the OMT (VOA) Act, this Court is inclined to show indulgence.
8. Under the above premise, it would be apt to set aside the Order dated 21.06.2002 passed in OMT
(VOA) Appeal Case No. 1 of 2000 and remit the matter to the Member, Board of Revenue, Odisha,
Cuttack for reconsideration of the appeal in the light of the observation made Signature Not Verified
