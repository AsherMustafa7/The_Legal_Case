Sunita Kumari vs The State Of Bihar on 15 October, 2025
Committee/ Screening Committee
contained in Memo No. 917-2 dated
31.10.2018
(Annexure-6) by which the PDS Dealership licence of Sunita Kumari (petitioner) was cancelled and
in her placed it was recommended to issue PDS Dealership licence to Rani Kumari and also
resolution adopted on 26.04.2019 by the Selection Committee/Screening Committee holding
resolution dated 25.10.2018 valid and approving resolution adopted on 25.10.2018 (Annexure-6).
(B. To issue a writ in the nature of Mandamus commanding/directing the Respondents to restore
PDS Dealership licence of petitioner forthwith.
(C. Any other relief or reliefs, writ or writs, direction or directions which this Hon'ble Court may
deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances may also be granted."
2. At this juncture, the Learned counsel for the respondents contended that Section 32(iii) of the
Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of
appeal and Section 32(vi) of the Bihar Targeted Public Patna High Court CWJC No.15822 of 2019
dt.15-10-2025 Distribution System (Control) Order, 2016 provides for the provision of revision.
Section 32(iii) 32(v) and 32(vi) read as follows:
"32 (iii). Any person aggrieved by an order of the licensing authority denying the
issue or renewal of the license to the fair price shop owner or cancellation of the
license may appeal to the District Officer within thirty days of the date of receipt of
the order and the District Magistrate shall, as far as practicable, dispose the appeal
within a period of sixty days."
32. (v) Till the disposal of appeal pending, the Appellate Authority may direct that the order under
appeal shall not take effect for such period as the authority may consider necessary for giving a
reasonable opportunity to the other party under sub-clause (4) or until the appeal is disposed of,
whichever is earlier.
(vi) Due to non disposal of the appeal within sixty days by the District Officer or against the order
passed in the appeal, a revision may be filed before the Divisional Commissioner. The revision shall
be disposed of within two months. Patna High Court CWJC No.15822 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
3. Admittedly, from the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition, it is evident that the petitioner has an
alternative remedy under the provisions of Bihar Targeted Public Distribution System (Control)
Order, 2016.
4. The remedy available under the Act is to prefer an appeal before the District Magistrate. As the
District Magistrate is the head of the Selection Committee he cannot review his orders in an appeal.
Therefore, the petitioner is directed to file a complaint/application before the Divisional
Commissioner.

5. The Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he intends to file a complaint/application
before the concerned authority, but the limitation period for filing the same has lapsed. He prayed
for a direction to the Patna High Court CWJC No.15822 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025 concerned authority
to entertain the same in accordance with Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
6. Taking into consideration that the petitioner has an alternative remedy for filing
complaint/application, the writ petition is disposed of with a direction to the petitioner to file
complaint/application within two months from the date of receipt of this order before the concerned
authority. The delay in filing the complaint/application shall be condoned by the authority
concerned, and the authority shall dispose of the same within three months from the date of filing of
the same. It is needless to mention that before passing any order the petitioner should be given a fair
opportunity for hearing.
7. With the above said observation, the Writ petition is disposed of.
Patna High Court CWJC No.15822 of 2019 dt.15-10-2025
8. Interlocutory Application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
