2024. It is a short order. It reads as under:-
"Heard learned counsel for the
Patna High Court L.P.A No.529 of 2025 dt.08-10-2025
2/4
petitioners and respondents.
2. These writ applications have been

concerned.
(iii). For issuance of an order, direction or an appropriate writ for staying the further process of
recruitment in the subject of Chemistry against advertisement dated 21.09.2020 issued by the Bihar
State University Service Commission during the pendency of the present writ application or for
directing the respondents to keep two posts in the subject of Chemistry vacant until disposal of these
writ applications.
3. The issues raised in these writ applications are no more res integra, as these issues were already
decided by the Division Bench of this Court in L.P.A. No. 653 of 2024 in C.W.J.C. No. 16795 of 2023
dated 06.09.2024.
4. Mr. Kumar Kaushik, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners accepts this fact that
L.P.A. No. 653 of 2024 has been decided against the persons having identical issues in the writ
application akin to that of the writ petitioners herein.
5. Accordingly, I do not find any merit Patna High Court L.P.A No.529 of 2025 dt.08-10-2025 in
these applications. The same stands dismissed."
2. Perusal of the same, it is evident that learned Single Judge has relied on a decision dated
06.09.2024 passed in LPA No. 653 of 2024. In this regard, appellant, if he is distinguishing LPA
decision, in that event, appellant has a remedy of filing Civil Review and not the present LPA.
3. Accordingly, the present LPA stands disposed of reserving liberty to the appellant to file Civil
Review, if he wants to distinguish the decision in LPA No. 653 of 2024.
