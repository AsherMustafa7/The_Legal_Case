the petitioner who is slated to give examination which is to commence on 05.05.2025, he has not
been issued any admit card nor he was able to download the same from the official website of the
University and in such circumstances, if the matter is not taken up the petitioner would suffer
irreparable loss.
Considering the aforesaid, the Court had granted permission that the matter be taken up today. In
the aforesaid backdrop the petition has been placed before this Court.

Sri Pankaj Srivastava learned Additional Chief Standing counsel has accepted notice on behalf of
respondent nos.1 and 2 whereas Sri Shubham Tripathi learned counsel has accepted notice on
behalf of respondent nos.3, 4 and 5.
At the outset, the counsel for the University has raised a preliminary objection regarding
maintainability of the petition. It is urged that the petitioner is pursuing his M.B.B.S course from
King George's Medical University since, 2006. He has a history of bad academic record. Since, he
was unable to clear the aforesaid course, hence, his candidature/admission was cancelled by the
University. This prompted the petitioner to assail the same in Writ C no.8720 of 2023 wherein
noticing peculiar facts and circumstances a coordinate Bench of this Court by means of the order
dated 08.08.2024 had permitted the petitioner to take his examination and further it was directed
in case if he was unable to clear the exam then neither the petitioner will ask for another chance nor
the same would be granted.
It is urged that after the intervention made by the Court vide order dated 08.08.2024, a letter was
issued to the petitioner on 09.09.2024 permitting him to take admission as directed by the High
Court and it was further indicated that in case, if he failed the examination, his name would be
struck off from University rolls immediately and no further opportunity for re-examination will be
granted.
It is urged that the said order has not been placed on record and in light of the earlier order dated
08.08.2024, the instant petition is not maintainable as it amounts to review of the earlier order
dated 08.08.2024.
Learned counsel for the petitioner while refuting the aforesaid submissions has urged that the
earlier order passed by the Court on 08.08.2024 was relating to the regular examination whereas
the petitioner is seeking the right to appear in supplementary examination.
It is urged that the results were declared on 29.03.2025 and the petitioner had also deposited the fee
for the supplementary examination and in such circumstances, the petitioner may not be debarred
from taking the examination and in such circumstances the respondent University be directed to
upload the admit card so that he can appear in the examination stated to commence on 05.05.2025.
The Court has heard learned counsel for the parties and also perused the material on record.
At the outset, as per the admitted facts, a coordinate Bench of this Court in Writ C no.8720 of 2022
dated 08.08.2024 had passed an order, a copy of which has been brought on record as Annexure
no.6. Paragraphs-6 to 9 of the said order is reproduced for the ease of reference:
"6. This Court has pondered over the contentions raised by the petitioner and also
considered the arguments of the respondents.
7. We have already observed the academic profile of the petitioner and have noticed
that he is pursing his MBBS Programme since 2006 and in each year of his MBBS

Programme he has spent substantial number of years before he could succeed and
lastly, he is studying in the 4th year since 2017. Though this Court was reluctant
initially in giving the petitioner any further chance, in view of the fact that the
petitioner has already spent a substantial number of times pursing the said course
but considering the fact that at the time of the admission of the petitioner, there were
no regulations prescribing the maximum period of studying for the said course and
also considering that the respondent medical University has already shown mercy,
the benefit of which was taken by the petitioner and still he could succeed in one
subject i.e. Gynaecology and only one subject remains to be cleared for awarding him
MBBS Degree.
8. It is in the aforesaid circumstances, this Court had asked the petitioner to submit
an Affidavit of undertaking that in case, one attempt is granted to him, he shall not
approach any authority or forum seeking any additional chances to clear his MBBS
Programme, which has been filed stating that in case, he is allowed to appear in the
forthcoming MBBS Final Professional Part -II Examination, then it will be treated to
be his last opportunity for clearing the examination.
9. In light of the above, this Court is of the view that the petitioner should be given
one last opportunity to clear his Surgery paper considering the fact that he is
pursuing the course for last 18 years and only one paper remains to be cleared and
accordingly, impugned order dated 14.08.2023 is set aside with regard to the
petitioner only to the extent that the petitioner shall be entitled to appear in the
examination of Surgery scheduled for sometime in the month of February, 2025. It is
also made clear that the petitioner shall neither seek nor he may be entitled to ask for
any further chance to clear his MBBS Programme. This order has been passed in the
peculiar circumstances of the case and it shall not be treated to be a precedent. "
Learned counsel for the petitioner could not dispute the fact that it is in furtherance of the order
dated 08.08.2024 the letter dated 09.09.2024 was issued by the University and putting him to
notice that the indulgence granted to him to appear as a last chance in the examination was on
account of indulgence granted by the High Court and in case if he failed, his name would be struck
of without being put to further notice. The said order dated 09.09.2024 has been provided by Sri
Tripathi learned counsel for the University for perusal of the Court and it is taken on the record.
It is not disputed that the petitioner did not receive the said order dated 09.09.2024. However,
neither there is any challenge to the same nor any explanation has been given as to why the said
order was not brought on record.
Be that as it may, since the earlier order dated 08.08.2024 was an extraordinary indulgence which
was granted by the Court and as also noticed in the order itself which as indicated states that it is not
to be treated as a precedent. Hence, in the given circumstances, this Court finds that the instant
petition at the behest of the petitioner is not maintainable as the relief which is now sought to be
claimed would run contrary to the observations of this Court in Writ C no.8720 of 2023 and that too

without there being any challenge to the order dated 09.09.2024. Moreover, entertaining the instant
petition would amount to rejecting order passed by the Court on 08.08.2024. Even otherwise, this
Court in the facts and circumstances does not find the instant case to be fit enough for this Court to
exercise its discretionary jurisdiction in favour of the petitioners.
Accordingly, this Court finds that the petition is misconceived and, hence, dismissed. Costs are
made easy.
