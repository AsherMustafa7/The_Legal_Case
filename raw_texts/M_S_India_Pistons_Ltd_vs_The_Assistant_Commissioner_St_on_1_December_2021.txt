and the petitioner had also replied to the above notices on 23.07.2018. Thereafter, a fresh notice was

in the two notices, the petitioner filed an interim reply dated 03.10.2018 and requested further time
for personal hearing.
5. It is submitted that however, without giving an opportunity of presenting the case in personal
hearing to the petitioner, the respondent proceeded to pass above mentioned five separate

Officers have however accepted the objections only in respect of 9 defects. It is submitted that

11. The learned Senior Counsel also submits that the invocation of Section 27 of the Act vide notices
mentioned above pursuant to the inspection dated 05.01.2017 and sworn statement dated
06.02.2018 were liable to be interfered as the Officers concerned were not authorised to take up the

decision of the Division Bench of this Court rendered in The Joint Commissioner (CT) Enforcement

Commissioner (CT) and others and the decision of this Court in Ran India Steels (P) Ltd., Rep.by its
Managing Director R.Radha, Ayyappa Tower, 1st Floor, C.H.B.Colony, Velur Road, Tiruchengode
637 211, Namakkal District Vs. The Principal Secretary/Commissioner of Commercial Taxes,
Ezhilagam, Chepauk, Chennai 600 005 and another, W.P.No.3172 of 2014. Relevant portion of the
said decision of this Court, reads as under:-
2.This issue is now covered by a decision of this Court in Interfit Techno Products
Ltd. Vs Principal Secretary/Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Ezhilagam, Chennai
and Another, (2015) 81 VST 389 (Mad).
3.In paragraph Nos.61 & 62, learned Single Judge has summarised his views as
follows:-
61. In the light of the above conclusion, the decision relied on by the learned counsel
for the petitioner in the case of Binani Industries Limited v. Assistant Commissioner
of Commercial Taxes VI Circle, Bangalore [2007] 6 VST 783 (SC) with regard to
reopening of the assessment does not render assistance to the case of the petitioners.
Accordingly Question No. 6 is answered against the petitioners.
62. In the result, _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631
of 2019 & etc. batch (1) the challenge to the impugned circular is held to be
unnecessary since the circular is a non statutory circular and is in the nature of
guideline and the prayer for quashing the circular is rejected.
(2) Section 18 of the TNVAT Act is not an independent or a separate stand alone provision under the
provisions of TNVAT Act but subject to other provisions of the Act including Section 19 of the VAT
Act.
(3) For the reasons assigned, it is not sufficient for a dealer claiming refund under Section 18(2) of
the Act to show that he has paid input tax on the goods purchased; that those goods are used in the
manufacture and nothing more but there is duty upon the dealer to satisfy the Assessing Authority
that the claim is not hit by any of the restrictions or conditions contained under Section 19 of the
VAT Act. In this regard, it is essential for the Assessing Authority to embark upon the fact finding
exercise to ascertain the quantum of loss of the goods which were purchased on which tax was paid
vis-a-vis the goods manufactured from and out of the goods purchased and to examine as to whether
they fall within any of the restrictions contained in Section 19 of the VAT Act. The Assessing Officer
has to conduct an exercise by which it is to be ascertained as to whether the representation made by
the dealer is justified and is not hit by any any of the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc. batch restrictions and conditions
contained in Section 19 and in particular Section 19(9) of the VAT Act.
(4) It is held that the Assessing Authorities are not justified in adopting uniform percentage as
invisible loss and calling upon the dealer to reverse the input tax credit availed to that extent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48616373/ 4
M/S.India Pistons Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 1 December, 2021
Consequently, all notices issued to the petitioner for reopening and all consequential order passed
reversing the input tax credit to the extent of either 4% or 5% or on adhoc per centage stands set
aside. However, liberty is granted to the concerned Assessing Officer to issue appropriate show
cause notices to the petitioners clearly setting out under what circumstances they propose to revise
or call upon the petitioner to reverse refund sanctioned and after inviting objections proceed in
accordance with law.
(5) The undertaking given by the dealer in Form W is with regard to information furnished for the
purpose of verification by the Assessing Officer under Rule 11(2) of the VAT Rules for being entitled
to refund under Section 18(2). Therefore, it is not as if the Act does not provide a remedy in the
event of a wrong or erroneous refund sanctioned when Section 18 cannot be treated as an
independent provision but subject to restrictions and conditions under Section 19 of the VAT Act.

16. As far as the other issues relating to use of indirect materials are concerned, the learned Senior
Counsel submits that if appropriate opportunity is given to the petitioner, the petitioner will explain
as to why the allegations in the notices were not tenable. Therefore, he submits that the impugned
orders are liable to be set aside.
17. As far as Manufacturing Loss is concerned, the learned Senior Counsel submits that the rejected
pistons were melted and recycled for further production. In respect of Waste Aluminum Borings, it
is submitted that the petitioner had sold them as scrap and paid output tax on the same and
therefore the question of reversal of ITC does not arise.
18. It was further submitted that the respondent called upon the petitioner to reverse ITC on the
ground that the seller did not report the corresponding turnover in Annexure II of their return and
therefore the petitioner was ineligible to avail ITC on said purchases even though the petitioner was
in possession of the original tax invoice and that the petitioner has also reversed ITC on the certain
purchases made from the dealers whose VAT Registrations were cancelled, but, details of all the
dealers were not _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc.
batch given to the petitioner.
19. Defending the impugned orders, the learned Government Advocate for the respondent submits
that there is no violation of principles of natural justice inasmuch as the petitioner was issued with
two notices for each of the assessment orders and a specific time was given for reply and for
appearance of the petitioner.
20. The respondent submits that as per Rule 10 of TNVAT Rules 2007, it is the duty of the petitioner
to prove that the sellers have paid the tax thereon. It is submitted that vide notice dated 05.09.2018,
a date was fixed for the personal hearing on 12.09.2018. However, the petitioner failed to avail the
opportunity of hearing. It is submitted that the aforesaid date of hearing was also fixed, but, the
petitioner failed to appear.

M/S.India Pistons Ltd vs The Assistant Commissioner (St) on 1 December, 2021
21. I have considered the arguments advanced by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and
the learned Government Advocate for the respondents. I have also perused the order dated
04.06.2019 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of the Joint Commissioner (CT)
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc. batch and others
Vs. M/s.Original Vel Sporting News, in W.A.No.1757 of 2019 in the context of Section 64(4) of the
TNVAT Act, 2006.
22. It is noticed that the appeal in W.A.No.1757 of 2019 arose from an order dated 26.07.2017
passed by the learned Single Judge in W.P.No.30098 of 2016 and batch. Challenge in the said
W.P.No.30098 of 2016 before the learned Single Judge was confined to Pre-Assessment Notice
dated 10.03.2016 for the Assessment Year 2007-08, issued on the basis of the VAT audit of the
business premises of the petitioner therein conducted on 08.09.2014 pursuant to the authorisation
dated 03.09.2014 bearing reference I.F.No.061/2014 issued by the Joint Commissioner of
Commercial Tax, Enforcement Wing-I. Challenge before the learned Single Judge in the aforesaid
case was not on the Circular dated 16.05.2014 bearing reference No.Q/11740/2013 of the
Commissioner.
23. Therefore, it is not clear as to why the matter came to be decided by the Division Bench by
holding that the said circular was bad in law when there was no challenge to the Circular dated
16.05.2014 bearing reference No.Q/11740/2013 of the Commissioner before the leaned Single
Judge. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc. batch
24. A reading of the order dated 26.07.2017 of the learned Single Judge of this Court in
W.P.No.30098 of 2016 and batch also does not refer to the aforesaid Circular dated 16.05.2014
bearing reference No.Q/11740/2013 of the Commissioner. Therefore, I am unable to apply the said
decision of the Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court to facts of the present cases.
25. In the decision of this Court in the case of M/s.Jain Jubilant Cars Private Limited, Represented
by its Director, No.18/3, Raja Annamalai Building, Rukumani Lakshmipathy Salai, Egmore,
Chennai – 600 008. vs. The Joint Commissioner (CT), Enforcement – I, Chennai – 600 006 and
two others, in W.P.No.24789 of 2015, dated 12.02.2021, a similar issue was considered by this
Court. This Court in the above case observed as under:-
17. In any event, no prejudice or harm will be caused to the petitioner merely because
the Audit Report was generated after an Audit held on 14.03.2014. After the Audit is
completed, a notice is to be sent for revision of assessment under Section 27 of the
Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006. It is therefore not open for the petitioner to
disown and distance itself for the liability that may be eventually fastened under
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc.
batch Section 27 of the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006.
26. Therefore, challenge to the notices and consequential order passed by the respondent on the
ground that they were contrary to Section 64(4) of the TNVAT Act, 2006 cannot be countenanced in
the light of the decision of this Court in Tvl.Bharath Traders, Represented by its Partner,

Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Ezhilagam, Chepauk, Chennai 600 005 and another, in
W.P.(MD) Nos.15103 of 2015 etc. batch, order dated 30.08.2019.
27. During the pendency of these writ petitions, the Principal Secretary / Commissioner of
Commercial Tax has also issued a letter dated 29.10.2021 bearing reference No.KW10/1539/2016.
The issue covered by the said Circular will have to be followed.
28. As far as invisible loss is concerned, the issue is now answered in W.P.No.3172 of 2014 vide
order dated 04.12.2019 following the views taken in M/s. Interfit Techno Products Ltd. Rep. By its
Managing Director- _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 &
etc. batch A.V. Palaniswamy SF. No. 112, Madhapur Road Kaniyur Village Karumathampatti Via
Coimbatore 641 018 vs. The Principal Secretary/Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Ezhilagam,
Chepauk, Chennai-600 005and another, 2014 SCC Online Mad 8459. To that extent, the impugned
order cannot be sustained.
29. As far as other surviving issue relating to indirect materials is concerned, notices are not clear as
to the basis on which the tax was proposed to be demanded. Therefore, the impugned Assessment
Orders are quashed to that extent and the cases are remitted back to the respondent.
30. Since the notices issued to the petitioner are also not clear, liberty is given to the respondent to
issue a corrigendum to the respective notices within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order. The petitioner shall thereafter file objections/reply, within a period of 30 days.
The respondent shall pass appropriate orders on merits within a period of 30 days thereafter.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.No.631 of 2019 & etc. batch
31. These Writ Petitions are thus partially allowed as far as invisible loss in the light of the above
discussion. So far as other issues relating to Input Tax Credit under Section 19(5)(c) of the TNVAT,
Act 2006 and demand and other issues, the respondent is directed to pass an order on merits and in
accordance with law, within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
32. Needless to state, before passing such order, the petitioner or an authorised representative of the
petitioner shall be heard in person and/or through Video Conference in case the petitioner desires
for a personal hearing.
