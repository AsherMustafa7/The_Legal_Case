the entire recruitment process initiated pursuant to the said
advertisement and to direct the respondents to re-advertise the

Act, 2016 and/or its statutes etc. and UGC norms.
4. Since the challenge made in these writ petitions is
one and the same, all the writ petitions were heard together and
disposed of by this common order.
BRIEF FACTS:
W.P.(C) No.791 of 2021:
5. The petitioner is a retired teacher/academician and former Head of Department in
the Manipur College, Imphal having more than 10 years of experience in academic

No. 807 of 2021 Page |6 administration organization. The petitioner came across an
advertisement dated 12.8.2021 issued by the Registrar, Manipur Technical University
inviting applications for the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University.
However, in the advertisement, an additional eligibility criteria, namely, experience
in technical education and/or academic administration organization has been added
against the prescribed criteria as indicated in the UGC Regulations, 2018.
The aforesaid act of the official respondents, clearly shows that the same has been done to favour
and appoint some blue-eyed persons so as to exclude the other eligible candidates. Such an action of
the official respondents is in gross violation of law. Hence, the writ petition.
6. Resisting the writ petition, second respondent Manipur Technical University filed
affidavit-in-opposition stating that for better administration and for bringing qualitative
improvement in the overall functioning of the newly established Technical University, "experience
in technical education and/or academic administration organization" was inserted in the
advertisement after the approval accorded by the Hon'ble Governor of Manipur. It is stated that in
the appointment of Vice-Chancellor of Technical Universities across the country, WP(C) No. 805 of
2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 Page |7

experience in technical education etc. has been specified apart from other qualifications contained
in the UGC Regulations, 2018 at the time of notification. Therefore, the said added additional
criteria is not illegal or unlawful and also is not in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by
the Constitution of India. Hence, prayed for dismissal of the writ petition.

10. The third respondent filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that he was appointed as
Vice-Chancellor as per the advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and he had submitted his application on

No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 10 appeared for the
interview along with the other short-listed candidates. The Selection Committee after interviewing
the short-listed candidates and after due consideration of the suitability of the candidate had made
its recommendation for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor and, thereafter, he was
appointed as Vice-Chancellor on 8.11.2021. Since the third respondent fulfilled the eligibility criteria
set out in the UGC Regulations, the official respondents have selected and appointed the third
respondent to the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University. That apart, the third
respondent possesses all the required eligibility criteria as mentioned in the second limb of
Regulation 7.3(i), i.e., ten years of experience in a reputed research and/or academic administrative
organization with proof of having demonstrated academic leadership. Thus, he prayed for dismissal
of W.P.No.805 of 2021.
11. The fourth respondent UGC filed affidavit-in-
opposition stating that it is for the institution/organization/employer to prescribe additional or
desirable qualifications, including any grant of preference and it is for the
employer/institution/organization who is best suited to decide the requirements of a candidate
according to the needs WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 11 of the employer and the nature of work to be employed thereon

the Vice-Chancellor is to be selected by a Search-cum-Selection Committee. The members of the
Search-cum-Selection Committee as per UGC guidelines is an expert body, wherein a nominee of the
UGC was also included, after considering all the issues like qualifications, experience etc. and has
recommended the name of the respondent No.3 who claims to be eligible for appointment as
Vice-Chancellor as per the experience of 10 years working in the Department of Technical
Education, Manipur since 2011 and also on the ground that the Department of Technical Education
is an academic administrative organization. As such the collective wisdom of the
Selection-cum-Search Committee could not be questioned in any manner as it is the prerogative of
the Committee based on the collective judgment after examining the candidates educational
background and performance in the interview and also without any deviation from the UGC
regulations prevailing at the relevant point of time. Since the petitioner subjected himself to the
selection process without actually challenging the stipulations made in the advertisement WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
12. The petitioner is a retired Associate Professor/Academician and former Head of Department in
the Manipur College having more than 10 years of experience in academic administration
organization. It is stated that he came to know the advertisement dated 12.8.2021 issued by the

against the prescribed criteria and being aggrieved by the said advertisement, he has filed
W.P.No.791 of 2021 before this Court with a prayer to quash the advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and
the entire recruitment process initiated pursuant to the said advertisement. During the pendency of
the said writ petition, the Chancellor of Manipur Technical University issued an order dated

fact that he is not at all eligible/qualified for appointment to the said post, as he is only a Lecturer

No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 13 Associate Professor in Government
Polytechnic. Hence, the writ petition.
13. Resisting the writ petition, the second respondent Manipur Technical University filed
affidavit-in-opposition stating that for better administration and also for bringing qualitative
improvement, the additional criteria was inserted in the advertisement calling for applications for
filling up the post of Vice-Chancellor. It is stated that for appointment of Vice- Chancellor, Manipur
Technical Education, a Selection Committee under Section 14(1) of Manipur Technical University
Act was constituted on 18.10.2021 and the Selection Committee has recommended the private

WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 14 suitability of
the candidates to Manipur Technical University's requirement had made its recommendation for

15. The third respondent filed affidavit-in-opposition stating that the petitioner has no locus standi
to file the present writ petition, as he had not applied for the post of Vice- Chancellor as per the
advertisement. Therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable. It is stated that pursuant to the
advertisement dated 12.8.2021, the third respondent applied on 9.9.2021 for the post of

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 8
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
28.10.2021 and he appeared for the interview along with the other short-listed candidates. The
Selection Committee after interviewing and finding suitability WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No.
791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 15 made its
recommendation for appointment to the post of Vice- Chancellor and, thereafter, he was appointed
as Vice- Chancellor on 8.11.2021. Since the third respondent fulfils the eligibility criteria set out in
the UGC Regulations, the official respondents have selected and appointed the third respondent to
the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University. That apart, the third respondent
possesses all the required eligibility criteria as mentioned in the second limb of Regulation 7.3(i). i.e.
ten years of experience in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organization with
proof of having demonstrated academic leadership. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the
writ petition.
W.P.No.825 of 2021:
16. The petitioner is a retired Professor and Head of Department, Acting Dean of the
College of Agriculture, Central Agricultural University and a bare perusal of the
advertisement dated 12.8.2021, it is seen that the eligibility criteria prescribed in the
advertisement is "as prescribed under Section 7.3 of the UGC Regulation dated
18.7.2018 on minimum qualification for appointment of teacher and other Academic
Staffs in Universities and Colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in
Higher Education, 2018 is provided. Apart from WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No.
791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 16 the
aforesaid UGC eligibility criteria, an additional requirement has also been added in
the advertisement as "experience in technical education and/or academic
administration organization" so as to appoint a person of their choice by
misinterpreting the eligibility criteria which has been done in this case.
17. According to the petitioner, as per Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, the
eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor has been provided
and the advertisement itself indicates about the requirement of the UGC regulation
and it has been stated that the person having 10 years of experience as Professor in a
University or ten years of experience in reputed research and/or academic
administration organization is qualified for appointment to the post of Vice-
Chancellor in any Universities. Such inclusion of technical qualification clearly shows the mala fide
intention of the respondent authorities to pick up and give appointment only to a person having
experience of technical education, thereby narrowing the area for appointment to the post of Vice-
Chancellor in Manipur Technical University which has happened in the instant case whereby an
ineligible person namely respondent No.3 has been appointed as Vice- WP(C) No. 805 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 17 Chancellor
vide order dated 8.11.2021, which is in gross violation of the eligibility criteria provided in the UGC
Regulations and the Manipur Technical University Act. Thus, the third respondent has usurped the
said post of Vice- Chancellor. The third respondent who has been appointed as Vice-Chancellor,
Manipur Technical University is not at all qualified/eligible as per the advertisement itself and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 9
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
therefore, the same is in violation of the UGC Regulations, 2018 and, as such, his appointment is
liable to be set aside.
18. Further case of the petitioner is that as per the list of AICTE approved Institutes in Engineering
and Technology (Diploma) for the academic year 2021-2022, the name of the Polytechnic in which
the third respondent was working is given and his name is found place in the list of faculty of
Government Polytechnic in the capacity as Lecturer. The notification of the AICTE dated 1.3.2019
stipulates the designation in respect Diploma Level Institute/Polytechnic is only three which are
Lecturer, Head of Department and Principal. There is no post of Professor in the Diploma level. As
per the relevant notification, the experience at degree level and diploma level are to be considered to
be equivalent provided scale of pay etc. are same for the post.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 18
19. According to the petitioners, the experience of the third respondent cannot be equated with that
of degree which is apparent from the pay matrix given in the notification and there is huge
difference of pay scale between diploma and degree. The Government Polytechnic is below the grade
of even a College and even a College does not have a post of Professor and the third respondent is a
Selection Grade Lecturer which is equivalent to Associate Professor and as per the UGC regulations,
the person appointed as a Vice-Chancellor should be a distinguished academician with minimum of
10 years of experience as Professor in a University or 10 years of experience in a reputed research
and/or academic administrative organization with proof of having demonstration academic
leadership. Since the act of the respondent authorities in appointing the third respondent to the post
of Vice- Chancellor, Manipur Technical University is in violation of the UGC guidelines and the third
respondent cannot hold the post of Vice-Chancellor in the larger public interest, the writ petition
has been filed for issuance of writ of quo-warranto.
20. The second respondent Manipur Technical University filed affidavit-in-opposition, inter lia,
stating that a writ of quo-warranto does not lie against the appointment of the third WP(C) No. 805
of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 19
respondent, as he has been appointed by following all statutory provisions including Regulation
7.3.(i) of the UGC Regulations dated 18.7.2018 for the post of Vice-Chancellor. Therefore, in the
absence of violation of any statutory rules in the appointment of the third respondent, the writ
petition is not maintainable. The third respondent is very much qualified to hold the post as per the
UGC Regulations, 2018.
21. It is stated that the petitioner has misconstrued the meaning of academic administrative
organization in the advertisement and the said interpretation is false. The Department of Technical
Education, Manipur is an organization which has overall control of all the institutes imparting
technical education in the State. The Department is involved in the Planning and Implementation of
Expansion and Development of all the technical, pharmaceutical and management institutes and
any other work of the Government relating to technical education as may be assigned from time to
time. Therefore, it is an academic administrative organization and the respondent No.3 has worked
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 10
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
in different positions in the Department of Technical Education since 2011. Therefore, the
respondent No.3 possesses the required eligibility criteria as mentioned in the advertisement dated
12.8.2021 and thus, the third WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of
2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 20 respondent has been appointed as Vice-Chancellor of
Manipur Technical University.
22. It is stated that the third respondent was selected by a duly constituted Selection Committee as
per Regulation 7.3 after he was found suitable for the post of Vice-Chancellor. Therefore, the duly
constituted Committee being an expert body, the opinion of the expert body would normally be
accepted by the Court and the Court would not substitute its view in this regard. Therefore, there is
no merit in the writ petition and the same is liable to be dismissed. ARGUMENTS:
23. Assailing the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and the appointment
order dated 8.11.2021, Mr. BP Sahu, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in
W.P.(C) Nos.791 and 807 of 2021 submitted that without authority of law in the
impugned advertisement, an additional qualification -
"Experience in Technical and/or Academic Administration Organisation" - was
inserted, which is nowhere found neither in the Manipur Technical University Act,
2016, nor in the UGC Regulations which is binding as per Section 9 of the Manipur
University Act. He would submit that the said qualification was inserted after more
than 4 months after the appointment of the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791
of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 21
Vice-Chancellor, who was appointed on 8.11.2021 and the decision to insert the said
qualification was taken on 17.3.2022.
24. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the Board of Governors was
presided by the Vice-Chancellor himself whose appointment was under challenge,
hence, the advertisement and all the consequential proceedings initiated pursuant to
the impugned advertisement, including the appointment of the respondent Dr.
Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University is liable to
be quashed.
25. The learned senior counsel then submitted that the affidavit-in-opposition filed
by the official respondents would reveal that the entire procedure adopted by the
respondents was illegal, as the Selection Committee was constituted in gross violation
of the provisions of the Manipur Technical University Act, 2016. Furthermore, as per
Section 14 of the Act, the Chairman of the Selection Committee is to be appointed by
the Chancellor from amongst the members. However, in the instant case, the
Chairman was appointed by the Government along with the formation of the
Committee, as indicated in the Resolution. Thus, highlighting the above grounds, the
learned senior counsel prays for setting aside the impugned WP(C) No. 805 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e |
22 advertisement and also the order of appointment issued in favour of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 11
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram thereby appointing him as Vice-Chancellor of
Manipur Technical University.
26. Challenging the impugned order of appointment dated 8.11.2021, Mr. N.
Jotendro, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.805 and 825
of 2021 submitted that the Registrar of Manipur Technical University, Imphal, issued
an advertisement calling upon applications for the post of Vice-Chancellor by
prescribing eligibility criteria and, apart from the criteria mentioned in the
advertisement, an additional requirement is added to the effect that "Experience in
Technical Education and/or Academic Administration Organisation", which
according to the learned senior counsel for the petitioner is in contravention of the
provisions of law. In fact, Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations dated 18.7.2018
provides eligibility criteria for appointment to the post of Vice- Chancellor.
27. The learned senior counsel further submitted that Regulation 7.3 clearly provides
that person having 10 years of experience in reputed research and/or academic
administration organisation is qualified for appointment to the post of Vice- WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807
of 2021 P a g e | 23 Chancellor in any Universities. However, as per the impugned
advertisement, the candidates need to possess "Experience in Technical Education",
which has been made more specific in the advertisement.
28. The learned senior counsel next submitted that though the petitioner Mutum
Shyamkesho Singh applied for the said post and was called upon to appear before the
Selection Committee along with the original copies of academic and other related
documents, he was not selected. According to the learned senior counsel, the said
petitioner is not only eligible as per the UGC Regulations, but also he is highly
qualified person.
29. The learned senior counsel urged that though the advertisement prescribes an
additional eligibility criteria, the third respondent who was appointed as
Vice-Chancellor is not at all qualified/eligible as per the advertisement and his
selection/appointment is in violation of the UGC Regulations and, as such, the same
is liable to be set aside. Learned senior counsel added that the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram was found not eligible even for appointment to the post of
Principal of his own Institution. Therefore, the act of the official respondents in
appointing the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is illegal and arbitrary to the
extent that they have WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825
of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 24 deprived the petitioner and other
similar incumbents, who are otherwise eligible for appointment to the post of
Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University.
30. Adding further, the learned senior counsel submitted that as per the list of AICTE
approved Institutes in Engineering and Technology (Diploma), Government of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 12
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
Manipur for the academic year 2021-2022, the name of Polytechnic, in which the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram worked, was noted and his name was also
found in the list of faculty of Government Polytechnic in which he joined as Lecturer
on 18.1.1991. As per Section 9 of the Manipur Technical University Act, 2016, the
University shall strictly adhere to the rules and regulations, norms and standards,
procedures and guidelines, which are binding to the University. As per the
notification of AICTE dated 1.3.2019, the designation in respect of Diploma Level
Institute/Polytechnic is only Lecturer, Head of Department and Principal and that
there is no post of Professor in the Diploma Level. Therefore, the experience of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram cannot be equated with that of the Degree
which is apparent from the pay matrix given in the notification in respect of Diploma
as well as Degree.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 25
31. The learned senior counsel argued that the Government Polytechnic is below the
grade of even a College and even a College does not have the post of Professor. The
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is a Selection Grade Lecturer, which is
equivalent to Associate Professor and he was working as Deputy Director, Technical
Education, Government of Manipur. According to the learned senior counsel, as per
the UGC guidelines, the person appointed as Vice-Chancellor should be a
distinguished academician with a minimum of 10 years of experience as Professor in
a University or 10 years of experience in a reputed research and/or academic
administrative organisation with proof of having demonstrated academic leadership.
Since the Polytechnic is an Institute for teaching only Diploma courses and of any
Degree level, it is not an academic administrative organisation.
32. The learned senior counsel then contended that the petitioner Dr.Ninghoujam
Ram Singh, who is a retired Professor and Head of Department and served over 19
years has every right to challenge the validity of the appointment of the private
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to a public office, as the law is well settled that
writ of quo-warranto can be filed by any citizens when the fundamental or other legal
right WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 26 of such person has been infringed and in the
larger interest of the general public. The petitioner Dr.Ninghoujam Ram Singh has
filed the writ petition to save the image of the Manipur Technical University and in
the interest of students. If the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is allowed to
continue as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University, the people will
certainly lose their faith and confidence in the democratic system of this nation where
the official respondents failed to exercise their administrative power in a fair and
transparent manner and, hence, the appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram is required to be declared as illegal and unconstitutional.

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
33. Per contra, Mr. T. Momo Singh, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent
Manipur Technical University has raised a preliminary objection as to the
maintainability of the writ petitions and submitted that the petitioner Khaidem
Joychandra Singh has not applied for the post of Vice-Chancellor and, therefore, he
has no locus to file the writ petition. As far as the petitioner Mutum Shyamkesho
Singh is concerned, his writ petition is not maintainable, as he had applied and
participated in the selection process for the post of Vice-Chancellor. Therefore, he
cannot turn around and WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 27 challenge the additional criteria
prescribed in the advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and also the selection process and
the appointment order.
34. As far as W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021 is concerned, the learned counsel for the
respondent Manipur Technical University submitted that the said writ petition is also
not maintainable, as the petitioner Dr.Ningthoujam Ram Singh has not approached
this Court with bona fide and in public interest. In fact, the said writ petition was
filed to over-come the plea of non-maintainability of the other three writ petitions.
He would submit that the said writ petition is liable to be dismissed, as the petitioner
is busybody having absolute no public interest except for personal gain or private
profit either for himself or as a proxy of others for extraneous motivation or for glare
of publicity.
35. As far as challenge to the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and the
impugned order of appointment dated 8.11.2021 is concerned, the learned counsel for
the respondent Manipur Technical University submitted that the essential eligibility
criteria has been stipulated in Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2018 and,
therefore, there is no illegality in the impugned advertisement. In fact, the said
additional criteria is not illegal for the following reasons: WP(C) No. 805 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e |
28
(a) The UGC Regulations, 2018 prescribes the minimum essential qualifications for
the post of Vice-Chancellor and there is no bar in prescribing an additional desirable
qualifications.
(b) It is the Institution/Organisation/Employer
which may prescribe additional or
desirable qualifications, including any grant of preference and it is for the
Institution/Organisation/Employer who is best suited to decide the requirements
that a candidate must possess according to the needs of the employer and the nature
of work.

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
(c) The petitioner Mutum Shyamkesho Singh, who applied and appeared for
interview is a Professor of Botany (Life Sciences) and the post of Vice-Chancellor,
Manipur Technical University is not limited to person with only technical
background.
36. The learned counsel further submitted that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram possesses
(i) Bachelor of WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 29 Civil Engineering, (ii) Master of Civil Engineering and (iii) Ph.D.
- Traditional Housing and Architecture of Manipur. Further, he submitted that the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram fulfilled the eligibility criteria set out in the second limb of Regulation
7.3(i) of UGC Regulations, 2018 i.e. 10 years of experience in a reputed research and/or academic
administrative organisation with proof of having demonstrated academic leadership, as he has
worked in different positions in the Department of Technical Education, Government of Manipur
since 2011.
37. Coming to the constitution of the Selection Committee which has been questioned by the learned
counsel for the petitioners, the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Technical University
submitted that the Selection Committee for appointment in the Manipur Technical University
consists of one member, who was a nominee of the UGC amongst the Chairman and other members.
The Selection Committee under Section 14(1) of the Manipur Technical University Act, 2016 was
constituted on 18.10.2021 by the Department of Higher & Technical Education, Government of
Manipur, for appointment of the Vice-Chancellor and the Selection Committee consists of the
following authorities (i) WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 30 State Government nominee and Chairman; (ii) nominee of the
Chancellor; (iii) nominee of the Board of Manipur Technical University and (iv) nominee of the
UGC.
38. Arguing so, the learned counsel urged that the duly constituted Selection Committee being an
expert body, the opinion of an expert body would normally be accepted by the Court and that the
Court would normally not substitute its view in this regard. It is also the submission of the learned
counsel that the post of Vice-Chancellor, Manipur Technical University is not a promotional post for
Professor of University. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss all the writ petitions.
39. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram questioned the
maintainability of the writ petitions and contended that the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.805 of 2021
appeared before the Interview Board without any protest and also without challenging the legality of
the advertisement dated 12.8.2021.Only when he was not selected for the post of Vice-Chancellor, he
has filed the writ petition raising so many grounds for challenging the appointment of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to the post of Vice- Chancellor. Such an action of the
petitioner is barred by the principles of estoppel. Since the petitioner Mutum Shaymkesho WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e
| 31 Singh participated in the recruitment process without any protest and since the result is not
found favourable to him, he cannot turn around and challenge the impugned recruitment process.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 15
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
40. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the petitioner Dr.Khaidem Joychandra Singh
[W.P.(C) No.807 of 2021] does not have locus standi to challenge the appointment of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram, as he is not a candidate for the impugned recruitment.
41. The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is that W.P.(C)
No.825 of 2021 is also not maintainable, as the petitioner Dr.Ningthoujam Ram Singh has not
approached this Court with bona fide and in clear public interest. In fact, he has filed the said writ
petition as proxy of petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.805 and 807 of 2021. After knowing fully well that
the said two writ petitions are not maintainable, W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021 came to be filed by the
petitioner Dr.Ningthoujam Ram Singh by impersonating as a public spirited holy man. He is a proxy
petitioner of the above writ petition and is an imposter. Hence, W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021 is liable to
be dismissed as not maintainable. WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825
of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 32
42. Qua merits of the matter, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Registrar of Manipur
Technical University issued an advertisement dated 12.8.2021 inviting applications for appointment
to the post of Vice-Chancellor from the intending candidates who have fulfilled the eligibility criteria
prescribed under Regulation 7.3 of UGC Regulations dated 18.7.2018 on minimum qualification for
appointment of teachers and other academic staff in Universities and Colleges and other measures
for the maintenance of standards in Higher Education Regulations, 2018. Since the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram possessed the minimum qualification, he applied for the post of
Vice-Chancellor and had also appeared before the Selection Board as one of the eligible candidates.
Based on his performance, he was selected and appointed as Vice- Chancellor on 8.11.2021 and since
then he has been discharging his duties as Vice-Chancellor of the Manipur Technical University.
43. The learned counsel added that after his deputation as Deputy Director in the Department of
Technical Education, Government of Manipur in year 2011, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram has participated in various administrative programmes with achievements and he WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e
| 33 has enough academic experience and exposures at the National and International level. He has
also have a lot of contribution to various research projects and won awards. That apart, he possessed
the minimum requisite qualification for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor and, therefore,
there is no illegality in the appointment of respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor
of the Manipur Technical University. Thus, the learned counsel prayed for dismissal of all the writ
petitions.
44. This Court also heard the submission of Mr. Kh. Samarjit, the learned Deputy Additional
Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondent UGC, who submitted that as far as the
additional criteria prescribed in the impugned advertisement is concerned, it is for the Institution/
Organisation/Employer to prescribe the additional or desirable qualifications, including any grant
of preference and also it is for the Institution/Organisation/Employer to decide the requirements of
a candidate according to the needs of the employer and the nature of work to be employed thereon.

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
45. The learned Deputy Additional Solicitor General further submitted that the members of
Search-cum-Selection Committee after considering the qualification and experience WP(C) No. 805
of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 34 etc.
has recommended the name of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram for appointment as
Vice-Chancellor on the ground that he has got experience of 10 years in the Department of Technical
Education since 2011 and also the Department of Technical Education is an academic administrative
organisation. As such, the collective wisdom of the Selection Committee could not be questioned in
any manner as it is the prerogative of the Selection Committee based on the collective decision after
examining the candidates' educational background and performance in the interview and also
without any deviation from the UGC Regulations prevailing at the relevant point of time. Therefore,
the petitioners have no right to question the advertisement as well as the appointment of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of the Manipur Technical University.
46. This Court considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and also
perused the materials available on record.
DISCUSSION:
MAINTAINABILITY OF WRIT PETITIONS:
47. Before adverting to the merits of the challenge made to the impugned advertisement and the
impugned WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No.
807 of 2021 P a g e | 35 appointment order thereby appointing the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University, let us first consider the
maintainability issue raised by the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram and also the respondent
Manipur Technical University.
48. According to the learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram, the petitioner
Dr.Khaidem Joychandra Singh had not applied for the post and, therefore, he has no locus to
question the appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram. In support of his submission,
the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Srinivasa Reddy v. Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board Employees' Association and
others, (2006) 11 SCC 731, wherein, in paragraph (78), Hon'ble the Apex Court held as under:
"78. The High Court, in the instant case, was not exercising certiorari jurisdiction.
Certiorari jurisdiction can be exercised only at the instance of a person who is
qualified to the post and who is a candidate for the post. This Court in Umakant
Saran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar, (1973) 1 SCC 485 held that the appointment cannot be
challenged by one who himself is WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 36 not qualified to be
appointed. In KumariChitra Ghosh v. Union of India, (1969) 2 SCC 228 a
Constitution Bench of this Court held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 17
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
(SCC p. 234, para 12) '12. The other question which was canvassed before the High
Court and which has been pressed before us relates to the merits of the nominations
made to the reserved seats. It seems to us that the appellants do not have any right to
challenge the nominations made by the Central Government. They do not compete
for the reserved seats and have no locus standi in the matter of nomination to such
seats. The assumption that if nominations to reserved seats are not in accordance
with the rules all such seats as have not been properly filled up would be thrown open
to the general pool is wholly unfounded.'"
49. The respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram also questioned the maintainability of W.P.(C) No.805
of 2021 by contending that the petitioner Mutum Shaymkesho Singh has failed to disclose true facts
qua the filing of the Review Petition No.23 of 2016 after the dismissal of the Writ Appeal No.56 of
2016 and the Division Bench of this Court allowed the Review WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No.
791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 37 Petition on 3.3.2017.
Moreover, he appeared before the Interview Board without any protest and also without challenging
the legality of the advertisement. To fortify his submission, the learned senior counsel placed
reliance upon the decisions of the Apex Court in the cases of K.D.Sharma v. Steel Authority of India
Limited and another, (2008) 12 SCC 481 and Ashok Kumar and another v. State of Bihar and others,
(2017) 4 SCC 357.
50. In K.D.Sharma, supra, the Apex Court held as under:
"34. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 and of the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution is extraordinary, equitable and discretionary.
Prerogative writs mentioned therein are issued for doing substantial justice. It is,
therefore, of utmost necessity that the petitioner approaching the writ court must
come with clean hands, put forward all the facts before the court without concealing
or suppressing anything and seek an appropriate relief. If there is no candid
disclosure of relevant and material facts or the petitioner is guilty of misleading the
court, his petition may be dismissed at the threshold without considering the merits
of the claim."
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 38
51. In Ashok Kumar, supra, the Apex Court held as under:
"13. The law on the subject has been crystallised in several decisions of this Court. In
Chandra Prakash Tiwari v. Shakuntala Shukla, (2002) 6 SCC 127, this Court laid
down the principle that when a candidate appears at an examination without
objection and is subsequently found to be not successful, a challenge to the process is
precluded. The question of entertaining a petition challenging an examination would
not arise where a candidate has appeared and participated. He or she cannot
subsequently turn around and contend that the process was unfair or that there was a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 18
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
lacuna therein, merely because the result is not palatable. In Union of India v. S.
Vinodh Kumar, (2007) 8 SCC 100, this Court held that: (SCC p. 107, para 18) "18. It is
also well settled that those candidates who had taken part in the selection process
knowing fully well the procedure laid down therein were not entitled to question the
same.
(See Munindra Kumar v. Rajiv Govil, (1991) 3 SCC 368 and Rashmi WP(C) No. 805
of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 39 Mishra v. M.P. Public Service Commission, (2006) 12 SCC 724.)"
14. The same view was reiterated in Amlan Jyoti Borooah, (2009) 3 SCC 227 wherein it was held to
be well settled that the candidates who have taken part in a selection process knowing fully well the
procedure laid down therein are not entitled to question it upon being declared to be unsuccessful.
15. In Manish Kumar Shahi v. State of Bihar, (2010) 12 SCC 576, the same principle was reiterated in
the following observations: (SCC p. 584, para 16) "16. We also agree with the High Court, 2008 SCC
OnLine Pat 321 that after having taken part in the process of selection knowing fully well that more
than 19% marks have been earmarked for viva voce test, the petitioner is not entitled to challenge
the criteria or process of selection. Surely, if the petitioner's name had appeared in the merit list, he
would not have even dreamed of challenging the selection. The petitioner invoked jurisdiction of the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India only after he found that his name does not
figure WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807
of 2021 P a g e | 40 in the merit list prepared by the Commission. This conduct of the petitioner
clearly disentitles him from questioning the selection and the High Court did not commit any error
by refusing to entertain the writ petition. Reference in this connection may be made to the
judgments in Madan Lal v. State of J&K, (1995) 3 SCC 486, Marripati Nagaraja v. State of A.P.
(2007) 11 SCC 522, Dhananjay Malik v. State of Uttaranchal, (2008) 4 SCC 171, Amlan Jyoti
Borooah v. State of Assam, (2009) 3 SCC 227and K.A. Nagamani v. Indian Airlines, (2009) 5 SCC
515."
52. By placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of B.Srinivasa Reddy, supra, the
learned counsel questioned the maintainability of W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021 by contending that the
said writ petition is also not maintainable, as the petitioner Dr.Ningtjoujam Ram Singh has not
approached this Court bona fide and in clear public interest and in fact he is proxy petitioner.
53. In reply, Mr. BP Sahu, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021
submitted that the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 41 petitioner could not apply due to the illegal insertion of
additional qualification that was imposed in the advertisement, though he is otherwise very much
eligible. It is also the submission of the learned senior counsel that the petitioner has every right for
challenging the validity of the appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to a public
office, as the law is well settled that writ petition can be filed by any citizen if any fundamental or
other legal right of such person has been infringed. Similarly, the submission of the other petitioners
is that their writ petitions are also maintainable as their legal right has been infringed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 19
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
54. The petitioners in these writ petitions have challenged the impugned advertisement, selection
and appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur
Technical University and one of the writ petitions is for issuance of a writ of quo-warranto.
55. Since the petitioners have narrated in detail in their writ petitions qua the cause for filing the
writ petitions and also taking into consideration the given facts and circumstances of the case put
forth by the parties, this Court is satisfied with the cause for filing all the writ petitions. Merely
because the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.805 of 2021 has participated in the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 42 selection
process and the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.807 and 825 of 2021 did not apply, the same cannot be a
ground to hold that the writ petitions are not maintainable.
56. At this juncture, it is apposite to mention that the law is well settled that a prerogative remedy is
not a matter of course. While exercising the extraordinary power a Writ Court would certainly bear
in mind the conduct of the party who invokes the jurisdiction of the Court. If the petitioner makes a
false statement or suppresses material fact or attempts to mislead the Court, the Court may dismiss
the action on that ground alone and may refuse to enter into the merits of the case.
57. It is also settled that a party who invokes the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India is supposed to be truthful, frank and open. He must disclose
all the material facts without any reservation even if they are against him. He cannot be allowed to
play "hide and seek" or to "pick and choose" the facts he likes to disclose and to suppress or not to
disclose other facts. The very basis of the writ jurisdiction rests in disclosure of true and complete
facts. If material facts are suppressed or distorted, WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 43 the very functioning of Writ Courts
and exercise would become impossible.
58. Nothing has been produced by the official respondents and the private respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to establish that the petitioners have approached this Court with unclean
hands and have also suppressed the material facts. The non-mentioning of the review application
arising out of the order passed in Writ Appeal No.56 of 2016 cannot be a ground to dismiss the writ
petition, as material facts have been suppressed. Taking into consideration the cause stated and also
explained by the petitioners in their writ petitions, this Court is of the view that the writ petitions
filed by the petitioners are very well maintainable. CHALLENGE TO THE IMPUGNED
ADVERTISEMENT DATED 12.8.2021:

"3. If any University contravenes the provisions of these Regulations, the
Commission after taking into consideration the cause, if any, shown by the University
for such failure or contravention, may withhold from the University, the grants
proposed to be made out of the Fund of the Commission."
62. Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations dated 18.7.2018 speaks about the eligibility criteria for
appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor. The said Regulation also provides that person having 10
years of experience as Professor in a University or ten years of experience in reputed research
and/or academic administration organization is qualified for appointment to the post of
Vice-Chancellor in any Universities.
63. For proper appreciation, Regulation 7.3 is extracted hereunder:
"7.3. VICE CHANCELLOR:
i. A person possessing the highest level of competence, integrity, morals and
institutional commitment is to be appointed as Vice-Chancellor. The person to be
appointed as a Vice-

minimum of ten years' of experience as Professor in a University or ten years' of
experience in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organisation with
proof of having demonstrated academic leadership.
ii. The selection for the post of Vice-
Chancellor should be through proper identification by a Panel of 3-5 persons by a
Search-cum-Selection Committee, though a public notification or nomination or a
talent search process or a combination thereof. The members of such
Search-cum-Selection Committee shall be persons of eminence in the sphere of
higher education and shall not be connected in any manner with the University
concerned or its colleges.
While preparing the panel, the Search-
cum-Selection Committee shall give proper weightage to the academic excellence,
exposure to the higher education system in the country and abroad, and adequate
experience in academic and administrative governance, to be given in writing along
with the panel to be submitted to the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 48 Visitor/Chancellor.

names recommended by the Search-
cum-Selection Committee.
iv. The term of office of the Vice-Chancellor shall form part of the service period of
the incumbent making him/her eligible for all service related benefits."
64. Thus, as per Regulation 7.3, person having 10 years of experience as Professor in a University or
10 years of experience in reputed Research and/or Academic Administration Organisation is
qualified for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor in any Universities. However, in the
impugned advertisement, it has been stated that candidates need to possess "Experience in
Technical Education, which has been made specific in terms of Manipur Technical University".
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 49
65. At this juncture, the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India appearing for the respondent
University Grant Commission submitted that for better administration and for bringing qualitative
improvement in the overall functioning of the newly established Technical University, clause -
Experience in Technical Education and/or Academic Administration Organisation - was inserted in
the impugned advertisement after obtaining approval from the Hon'ble Governor of Manipur. The
learned Deputy Solicitor General of India further submitted that in the appointment of
Vice-Chancellors of Technical Universities across the country, experience of technical education etc.
is also specified apart from other qualifications contained in the UGC Regulations, 2018.
66. It is also the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India that it is for the
institution/organisation/employer to prescribe additional qualifications, including any grant of
preference, and also it is for the institutions to decide the requirements of a candidate according to
the needs of the employer and the nature of work to be employed thereon, subject to fulfilment of
other criteria as per the existing rules and regulations of the UGC or which do WP(C) No. 805 of
2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 50 not go
in conflict with such rules and regulations of the UGC. In support, the learned Deputy Solicitor
General of India placed reliance upon the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Maharashtra
Public Service Commission through its Secretary v. Sandeep ShriramWarade and others, (2019) 6
SCC 362, wherein, it has been held as under:
"9. The essential qualifications for appointment to a post are for the employer to
decide. The employer may prescribed additional or desirable qualifications, including
any grant of preference. It is the employer who is best suited to decide the
requirements a candidate must possess according to the needs of the employer and
the nature of work. The court cannot lay down the conditions of eligibility, much less
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 23
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
can it delve into the issue with regard to desirable qualifications being on a par with
the essential eligibility by an interpretive re- writing of the advertisement. Questions
of equivalence will also fall outside the domain of judicial review. If the language of
the advertisement and the rules are clear, the court cannot sit in judgment over the
same. If there is an ambiguity in the advertisement or it is contrary to any rules or
law the matter has to go back to the appointing authority after appropriate orders, to
proceed in WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021
and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 51 accordance with law. In no case can the court,
in the garb of judicial review, sit in the chair of the appointing authority to decide
what is best for the employer and interpret the conditions of the advertisement
contrary to the plain language of the same."
67. By placing reliance upon the very same decision of the Apex Court in the case of Sandeep
Shriram Warade, supra, the learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram submitted
that the employer has every right to prescribe additional and desirable qualification, including any
grant of preference, for appointment to the post of Vice- Chancellor and no one, including the
petitioners, have any right to question the same.
68. It is true that the institution/organisation/employer is the best authority to decide the
requirements of a candidate according to the needs of the institution/organisation/employer and
the nature of work for which a person is required to be employed. However, the prescription of
additional criteria and/or desirable qualifications should not be in violation of the UGC Regulations.
In the case on hand, it is apparent that the additional criteria made in the impugned advertisement
is not in accordance with the UGC Regulations, 2018 which were WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No.
791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 52 prevalent at the relevant
point of time and also not in accordance with the Manipur Technical University Act, which is in
vogue and binding at the relevant point of time.
69. The appointment of Vice-Chancellor is governed by Section 14 of the Manipur Technical
University Act, 2016 and Section 14(1) would be relevant and the same is quoted hereunder:
"14(1) The vice-Chancellor shall be a whole-time paid officer of the University and
shall be appointed by the Chancellor in consultation with the State Government upon
recommendation of a Selection Committee consisting of -
(a) One person nominated by the
Board not connected with the
University or any College thereof;
(b) One person nominated by the
Chairman, University Grants
Commission;
(c) One person nominated by the
Chancellor
(d) One person nominated by the State
Government;
and the Chancellor shall appoint one of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 24
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
these persons to be the Chairman of the
Committee:
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 53 Provided that the first Vice-Chancellor, who shall hold
office for a term of three years, shall be appointed by the State Government.
Provided further that till the appointment of the first Vice-Chancellor, the
administrative Secretary in-charge of the Department of Higher and Technical
Education, Government of Manipur shall be the ex- officio Vice-Chancellor of the
Manipur Technical University."
70. Neither the Manipur Technical University Act nor the UGC Regulations specify the condition
that the Vice- Chancellor should have experience in technical education and/or academic
administration organisation. As per Section 2(xxiii) of the Manipur Technical University Act,
technical education means programmes of education, research and training in Engineering,
Technology, Architecture, Management, Town Planning, Pharmacy, Computer Applications and
Applied Arts and Crafts and such other programmes as the AICTE may by notification in the Official
Gazette declare. Section 2(xxiv) of the Manipur Technical University Act provides that technical
institutions means institutions conducting programmes in the field of technical WP(C) No. 805 of
2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 54
education. Thus, it is clear that technical education means programmes but not any official work of
the Department of Technical Education, Government of Manipur. Therefore, as rightly argued by
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners, there is conflict between the impugned advertisement
and the Manipur Technical University Act or UGC Regulations since, in the impugned
advertisement, an additional criterion has been inserted without any authority of law.
71. At this juncture, it is to be highlighted that the law is well settled that the Court has to be satisfied
about (a) the credentials of the applicant; (b) the prima facie correctness or nature of information
given by him and (c) the information being not vague and indefinite. The information should show
gravity and seriousness involved. Further, the Court has to strike a balance between two conflicting
interest: (i) nobody should be allowed to indulge in wild and reckless allegations besmirching the
character of others; and (ii) avoidance of public mischief and to avoid mischievous petitions seeking
to assail, for oblique motives, justifiable executive actions. In such case, however, the Court cannot
afford to be liberal. It has to be extremely careful to see that under the guise of redressing a public
grievance, it does not encroach upon the sphere reserved by WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791
of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 55 the Constitution to the
executive and the legislature. The Court has to act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and
busybodies or meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public-spirited holy men. They
masquerade as crusaders of justice. They pretend to act in the name of pro bono public, though they
have no interest of the public or even of their own to protect.

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
72. As held supra, in the instant case, there is clear conflict between the impugned advertisement
and the Manipur Technical University Act or UGC Regulations. When there is a conflict between the
executive order/advertisement and statutory rules and regulations, the statutory rules and
regulations shall prevail above all.
73. As stated supra, the eligibility criteria for the post of Vice Chancellor has been specifically stated
in Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations dated 18.7.2018. More particularly, three options are
provided in Regulation 7.3. dated 18.7.2018 -
(i) Sense of equivalent status as that of a Professor in a University whose Grade Pay is Rs.10,000 as
per the 6th Pay Commission; (ii) The first Vice-Chancellor of the Manipur Technical University was
Prof.Dr.Laiphrakpam Tombi Singh, retired Professor (Economics) and Dean (School of Social
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 56 Science), Manipur University who was appointed to that position by an order passed by
the Commissioner (Higher and Technical Education), Government of Manipur during October, 2017
and, (iii) The appointment of Dr.L.Tombi Singh as 1st Vice- Chancellor of Manipur Technical
University was made in compliance with the provisions contained in Regulation 7.3 of the UGC
Regulations dated 30.6.2010 on minimum qualifications for appointment of Teachers and other
Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in
Higher Education, 2010, which was in force at that relevant point of time. On a perusal of the
pleadings, the first Vice-Chancellor was selected and appointed only as per the stipulations made in
Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2010 and as per the Manipur Technical University Act.
Therefore, the selection of Vice-Chancellor of the Technical University should be as per the
Regulations of the UGC existed and as per the provisions of the Manipur University Act. In the
instant case, it is apparent that the additional criteria made in the impugned advertisement, more
particularly, "experience in technical education" is contrary to the UGC Regulations, 2018 in vogue
at the relevant point of time. WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of
2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 57
74. Qua the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Technical University that
the insertion of additional criteria in the impugned advertisement is only after the approval of the
Governor of Manipur, the law is well settled that nobody can act beyond the provisions of the
Manipur Technical University Act. As rightly argued by learned senior counsel for the petitioners,
the Chancellor also cannot act beyond the law. Therefore, the approval, if any, accorded by the
Governor of Manipur, for insertion of additional criteria in the impugned advertisement cannot be
appreciated, as the same is not in accordance with the UGC Regulations.
75. Thus, as rightly argued by learned senior counsel for the petitioners, particularly, the learned
senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.791 of 2021, the materials produced by the parties
prima facie establish that the official respondents have added the additional criteria only with an
alternate motive to narrow down the area of eligible candidates with an intention to give benefit to a
particular individual having experience in technical education thereby excluding the other eligible
candidates. The said act of the official respondents is highly arbitrary in nature to the extent that
they have deprived not only the petitioners but also the other similarly situated WP(C) No. 805 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 26
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023

incumbents, who are otherwise eligible for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor thereby
violating the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. As stated supra, inserting
an additional eligibility criteria which is found neither in the Manipur Technical University Act nor
Statutes nor Ordinances nor in the UGC Regulations, 2018 is unlawful. More particularly, the said
additional criteria inserted in the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 is in violation of the
Regulation 7.3, supra.
76. Further, learned senior counsel for the petitioners collectively argued that since the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has experience in technical education, such an addition in the
advertisement has been made. To controvert the said submission, the official respondents have
failed to produce any material.
77. It is well settled that when once the eligibility criteria fixed by the UGC under its Regulations
would, to the mind of this Court, apply to all the Universities which are aided and guided by the
UGC, even in the absence of the same being incorporated under the respective Universities Act of
the respective States, all the Universities are bound to adhere to the same.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 59
78. In view of the above, this Court is of the considered view that the insertion of additional criteria -
Experience in Technical Education and/or Academic Administration Organisation - in the
impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 is clearly in violation of the Manipur Technical University
Act and also UGC Regulations. Therefore, the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 is liable to
be set aside.
CHALLENGE TO THE IMPUGNED ORDER DATED
08.11.2021:
79. As far as the challenge made to the selection and appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram vide order dated 8.11.2021 impugned in W.P.(C) Nos.805 and 807 of 2021 is concerned,
the learned senior counsel for the petitioners contended that the selection of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is vitiated on the ground of ineligibility and also violation of the procedure
adopted by the official respondents in selecting the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram.
80. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Technical University, inter
alia, submitted that respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram possess (i) Bachelor of Civil Engineering;
(ii) Master of Civil Engineering and (iii) P.D. WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C)
No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 60 "Traditional Housing & Architecture of
Manipur". He has also fulfilled the eligibility criteria set out in the second limb of Regulation 7.3(i)
i.e. 10 years of experience in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organisation with
proof of having demonstrated academic leadership, as he worked in different positions in the
Department of Technical Education, Government of Manipur since 2011.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 27
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
81. The learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram also argued that the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram applied for the post of Vice- Chancellor of the Manipur
Technical University under the option
- "academic administrative organisation with proof of having demonstrated academic leadership"
and that after his deputation as Deputy Director in the Department of Technical Education,
Government of Manipur in the year 2011, he has participated in various administrative programs
with achievements. In fact, he has enough academic experience and exposures at the National and
International level and he also have a lot of contribution to various research projects and won
awards.
82. The learned counsel urged that even if a person is not a Professor of the University but if he
possessed the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 61 criteria/option i.e. 10 years of experience in a reputed research and/or
academic administrative organisation with proof of having demonstration academic leadership
mentioned in Regulation 7.3, he/she can be appointed to the post of Vice- Chancellor. Thus, the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram fulfilled the criteria and he is eligible for the post of Vice-
Chancellor.
83. In the earlier paragraph, this Court held that the insertion of additional criteria - experience in
technical education and/or academic administration organisation - in the impugned advertisement
dated 12.8.2021 for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor is in violation of the Manipur
Technical University Act and also UGC Regulations, 2018. The respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram
himself admitted that he had applied for the aforesaid post under the option "academic
administrative organisation". Once the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 is set aside by this
Court on the ground that the additional criteria inserted in the advertisement is not in accordance
with the UGC Regulations, 2018 and the Manipur Technical University Act, automatically the
selection and appointment pursuant to the said advertisement will non- est in the eye of law.
However, for proper adjudication of the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 62 matter, this Court is inclined to further
elaborate upon this issue qua the selection and appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram as Vice Chancellor of the Manipur Technical University.
84. As could be seen from the records, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram was a Lecturer of
Government Polytechnic, Takyelpat, who was on deputation/utilization to the Department of
Technical Education, Government of Manipur. He was appointed as Lecturer of the Government
Polytechnic on 18.1.1991 and Government Polytechnic, Tayelpat is a Diploma Institute recognized by
AICTE and affiliated to Manipur University.
85. There is no dispute that the eligibility criteria for the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur
Technical University has been as per the prescription in Section 7.3 of the UGC Regulations dated
18.7.2018 on minimum qualifications for appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staffs in
Universities and Colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards in Higher Education,
2018. At the cost of repetition, Regulation 7.3(i) is reproduced hereunder:

The person to be appointed as a Vice-
Chancellor should be a distinguished academician, with a minimum of ten years' of
experience as Professor in a University or ten years' of experience in a reputed
research and/or academic administrative organisation with proof of having

86. Regulation 7.3(i) clearly worded that the person having 10 years of experience as Professor in a
University or 10 years of experience in reputed research and/or academic administrative
organisation is qualified for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor in any Universities.
87. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the respondent Manipur Technical University as well as
the learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram submitted that the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has got WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of
2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 64 administrative experience of 10 years in a reputed
research and/or academic administrative organisation in Government Organisation/Autonomous
Body such as Directorate of Technical Education, All India council of Technical Education,
University Grant Commission, Ministry of Education, Department of Science and Technology etc.
They urged that the word "or" is used to segregate the two options of qualifications as the
Vice-Chancellor of University. Therefore, Section 7.3 of the Regulation clearly gives two options
which operates independently. The arguments aforesaid cannot be countenanced, in view of the
findings arrived at by this Court that the additional criteria inserted in the advertisement dated
12.8.2021 is in violation of the Manipur Technical University Act and the UGC Regulations.
Moreover, it is the admitted case of the respondents that the petitioners have also got academic
administrative organisation.
88. The person to be appointed as a Vice-Chancellor of the Technical University should be a
distinguished academician, with a minimum of 10 years of experience as Professor in a University.
89. The learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram contended that the petitioner
is WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of
2021 P a g e | 65 deliberately misinterpreting the phrase "ten years of experience as Professor" in
Regulation 7.3(i) of UGC Regulations, 2018 for the post of Vice-Chancellor to be an essential criteria
for appointment as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University to favour his contentions that
only Professor with ten years of experience is qualified to be a Vice-Chancellor of a University.
Further, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram worked in different positions in the Department
of Technical Education since 2011 and the said Department comes under the ambit of academic
administrative organisation. Therefore, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram possesses all the
required eligibility criteria as mentioned in the advertisement dated 12.8.2021.

90. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the petitioners pleaded the ineligibility of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram in the following lines:
(a) The respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is not a distinguished academician which is evident
from the fact that he has not produced proofs for publication of research paper/book published,
production of Ph.D WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 66 produced, presentation of research papers in
seminars/conferences etc.
(b) The substantive post that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram holds in the parent
organisation i.e. in the Government Polytechnic is Lecturer (Selection Grade). Moreover, the
Government Polytechnic is a Diploma Institute whose status is lower than a degree Engineering
College.
This post of Lecturer (Selection Grade) is far inferior to the grade of Professor or its equivalent as
required under Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2018 dated 18.7.2018.
91. On a reading of the pleadings of the parties, the Ph.D degree the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram holds is in the subject of History on the topic "Traditional Housing & Architecture of
Manipur" from the Department of History, Manipur University and it is not an Engineering subject.
Whatever the job assignments that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram got on
deputation/utilisation in the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of
2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 67 Department of Education can never be treated as being
equivalent to the status of Professor of University on the ground that his regular position is Lecturer
(Selection Grade) in the Government Polytechnic, Takyelpat, which is even inferior to an Assistant
Professor of a degree Engineering College. Further, whatever experiences that the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram attained by working at different positions in the Department of Technical
Education are not at the level of Professor, rather they are merely at the level of Lecturer (Selection
Grade) and, such experiences of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram cannot be taken into
consideration for the post of Vice-Chancellor, contrary to the stipulations made in Regulation 7.3 of
the UGC Regulations, 2018.
92. That apart, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram does not possess qualifications as required
under AICTE Regulations, 2019 for direct recruitment either as Professor or as Principal of an
Engineering College on the grounds that (i) He has not obtained Ph.D degree in Engineering
subject; (ii) He has not guided any Ph.D under his supervision; (iii) He has not met minimum 8
research publication in SCI journals/UGC/AICTE approved list of journal; (iv) He has not fulfilled
the minimum 15 years of experience in WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 68 teaching/research/industry, out of which at
least 3 shall be at the post equivalent to that of Professor. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has not possessed the required qualification for selection of
the post of Vice-Chancellor at the relevant point of time.

93. Coming to the constitution of Search-cum- Selection Committee, the learned senior counsel for
the petitioners submitted that while making selection and appointment of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram, the UGC Regulations have not been followed strictly. Moreover, Shri
M.Harekrishna Singh was one of the members of the Search-cum-Selection Committee Member, as
the said Shri M.Harekrishna Singh being the Chairman of the Committee cannot be included as
Chairman as per Section 14 of the Manipur Technical University Act and also Regulation 7.3 for
appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram. As such, the appointment of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is liable to be quashed.
94. On the other hand, it is the say of the respondent Manipur Technical University that the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram was selected by the duly constituted Search-cum-Selection
Committee and in the present case, the WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 69 Selection Committee for the appointment in the
Manipur Technical University consists of one member, who was the nominee of the UGC amongst
the Chairman and other members. The Selection Committee under Section 14(1) of the Manipur
Technical University Act was constituted on 18.10.2021 by the Department of Higher & Technical
Education, Government of Manipur for the appointment of Vice- Chancellor.
95. The learned Deputy Solicitor General of India for the respondent UGC submitted that according
to Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2018, the Vice-Chancellor is to be selected by the
Search-cum-Selection Committee, according to the composition and the procedure of the said
Committee set out therein.
96. The learned Deputy Solicitor General of India further submitted that the nominee of the UGC is
also to be a part of the Selection Committee as contemplated by Section 14(1) of the Act and, as such,
on both counts UGC remains only a part of either of the Search-cum-Selection Committee under
Regulation 7.3 or under Section 14(1) of the Manipur Technical University Act. As such, it should
not painted as somebody who solely decides upon everything and that the collective wisdom WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e
| 70 of the Search-cum-Selection Committee could not be questioned in any manner as it is the
prerogative of the Selection Committee to decide as to the eligibility criteria of various candidatures
of the post to be filled up.
97. Regulation 7.3(ii) provides as under:
"The selection for the post of Vice-Chancellor should be through proper identification
by a Panel of 3-5 persons by a Search-cum-
Selection Committee, though a public notification or nomination or a talent search
process or a combination thereof. The members of such Search-cum-Selection
Committee shall be persons of eminence in the sphere of higher education and shall
not be connected in any manner with the University concerned or its colleges. While
preparing the panel, the Search-cum-

Selection Committee shall give proper weightage to the academic excellence,
exposure to the higher education system in the country and abroad, and adequate
experience in academic and administrative governance, to be given in writing along
with the panel to be submitted to the Visitor/Chancellor. One member of the
Search-cum-Selection Committee shall be nominated by the Chairman, University
Grants Commission, for selection of Vice WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of
2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 71 Chancellors of
State, Private and Deemed to be Universities."
98. It is pertinent to note that any Committee is to be appointed/formed as per Section 26(h) of the
Manipur Technical University Act. Section 26(h), provides:
"(h) to appoint such committees, either standing or temporary, as it deems necessary
for its proper functioning"
99. As per Section 14(1) of the Act, the Selection Committee must consist of the following members:
(e) One person nominated by the
Board not connected with the
University or any College thereof;
(f) One person nominated by the
Chairman, University Grants
Commission;
(g) One person nominated by the
Chancellor
(h) One person nominated by the State
Government
and the Chancellor shall appoint one of these persons to be the Chairman of the Selection
Committee.

100. On a further perusal of the proceedings of the 14th Board of Management Meeting of Manipur
Technical University held on 17.3.2022, the State Government constituted the Selection Committee
comprising the following members:

Sl. Name & Designation Position in the

1. Shri M.Harekhrishna State Government Commissioner (Higher nominee and & Technical Edn.)

2. Shri Bobby Waikhom Nominee of the Secretary to Governor Chancellor of of Manipur Manipur

3. Shri Dr.S.Venugopal Nominee of the Director, National Board of Manipur Institute of Technical
Technology, University Chumukedima, Dimapur
4. Shri Dinesh Kumar Nominee of the Vice-Chancellor, JC University Bose University of Se Grant
Commission & Tech, YMCA, (UGC) Faridabad
101. The Selection Committee has been constituted to recommend the candidates for appointment
of a Vice- Chancellor was confirmed by the 14th Board of Management on 17.03.2022, whereas the
appointment was made on 8.11.2021, WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 73 which is after four months. A perusal of
Resolution No.6 of the 13th Board of Management, it is seen that it only made a proposal to the
State Government to nominate its members so as to constitute the Selection Committee for the
appointment of Vice-Chancellor. Therefore, the question of approval of any Selection Committee by
the 14th Board of Management does not even arise, as something which was not in existence cannot
be approved. Thus, it is clear that the Selection Committee is in contravention/violation of
norms/guidelines for the reasons that the Chairman is to be appointed by the Chancellor, whereas in
the instant case the Chairman has already been appointed by the Board of Management. From the
above, it is clear that without the recommendation of the any valid Selection Committee, the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has been appointed. Furthermore, the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram himself was the Chairman of the 14th Board of Management whereas the
Chairman of the 13th Board of Management was one of the members of the 14th Board of
Management.
102. It is also seen that the Selection Committee was constituted in gross violation of the provisions
of the Manipur Technical University Act. Furthermore, as per Section 14 of the WP(C) No. 805 of
2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 74 Act,
the Chairman of the Committee is to be appointed by the Chancellor from amongst the members.
However, in the present case, the Chairman was appointed by the Government along with the
formation of the Committee. That apart, the Selection Committee members one and two are not
proper persons and they are not educationists and are IAS officers. Therefore, this Court is of the
view that violating the statutory guidelines and the prescription prescribed in the UGC Regulations,
with a mala fide intention, the Selection Committee found the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram
eligible for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor and called him for interview, though he is not
qualified and eligible for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor in question.

Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
103. Qua the role of the Selection Committee in the selection of Vice-Chancellor of the University,
time and again, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that Search-cum-Selection Committee plays a vital and
significant role in the selection of the Vice-Chancellor; yet the Vice-Chancellor's performance in the
Universities vary from University to University. Therefore, the members of the Search Committee,
who are given the privilege and honour of selecting and suggesting names for the appointment of
Vice-Chancellor are directly or indirectly WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C)
No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 75 responsible for the achievement of the
University. Commitment to the quality and the objectives of the Universities in particular and higher
education system in general are of course the deciding factors in selecting the right person.
104. At the cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is a
Selection Grade Lecturer at Government Polytechnic, Imphal West (Diploma Level), which is
equivalent to Associate Professor and at the time of selection, he was working as Deputy Director,
Technical Education, Government of Manipur. The respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram claimed
that he has fulfilled the eligibility criteria set out in Regulation 7.3 - 10 years of experience in a
reputed research and/or academic administrative organisation with proof of having demonstrated
academic leadership. But the fact remains that at the time of his selection and appointment as
Vice-Chancellor, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram did not fulfil the eligibility criteria
required as per the UGC guidelines as well as even the eligibility criteria fixed by the Selection
Committee. That apart, at the time of selection and appointment, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram was not having 10 years of WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 76 experience as Professor or even its equivalent
which was the mandatory requirement as per the UGC guidelines.
105. It is to be noted that UGC Regulations, 2010 has been superseded by UGC Regulations, 2018.
However, there is no dispute that the eligibility criteria for the post of Vice- Chancellor and the
constitution of the Selection Committee for appointment of a Vice-Chancellor remains almost the
same. On a reading of Section 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2010, it emerges that "a person
possessing the highest level of competency, integrity, morals and institutional commitment is to be
appointed as Vice-Chancellor. The person to be appointed as Vice-Chancellor should be a
distinguished academician, minimum of ten years' of experience as Professor in a University system
or ten years' experience in an equivalent position a reputed research and/or Academic
Administrative Organisation. As stated supra, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has not
obtained Ph.D degree in Engineering subject; not guided any Ph.D under his supervision; not met
minimum 8 research publication in SCI Journals/UGC/AICTE approved list of journal; and (iv) not
fulfilled the minimum 15 years of experience in teaching/research/industry, out of which at least 3
shall be at the post equivalent to that of Professor. WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021,
WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 77
106. It is also clear from the pay scale of the candidate, who claims to be eligible as per the second
limb of Regulation 7.3 of the UGC Regulations, 2010 will have to be equivalent to that of a Professor
in a University. However, in the instant case, the pay scale of respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram
as Deputy Director in the Technical Education under the Department of Higher and Technical
Education, Government of Manipur is stated to be Rs.9300-34800 plus GP 4400, which is much
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 34
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
lower than that of a Professor of a University i.e. Rs.37400-67000 plus AGP Rs.10000. This Court is
of the view that since the UGC has prescribed certain qualifications for the appointment for the post
of Vice-Chancellor, such an appointment must be in accordance with the provisions laid down in the
UGC Regulations, 2018 and the Manipur Technical University Act.
107. The argument of learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram that the
petitioner in W.P.(C) No.805 of 2021 is estopped from challenging the appointment order as he had
participated in the selection process is concerned, the law in this connection is settled that where
glaring irregularities are committed in the procedure, the principle of estoppel or acquiescence has
no application. WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 78
108. The eligibility criteria and selection process when once fixed by UGC under its Regulations at
the relevant point of time would apply to all the Universities, including the Manipur Technical
University, which are aided by the UGC. Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the act
of the official respondents in selecting and appointing the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to
the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical University in violation of the UGC Regulations,
2018 is not only illegal, but also arbitrary, mala fide and capricious to the extent that the official
respondents have deprived the petitioners and other similarly situated incumbents, who are
otherwise eligible for appointment to the post of Vice- Chancellor, thereby violating the fundamental
rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. Thus, the petitioners have made out a case for
quashing of the impugned appointment order dated 8.11.2021 issued in favour of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram. Accordingly, the impugned appointment order dated 8.11.2021 along with
the entire recruitment process in regard to the selection of Vice- Chancellor, Manipur Technical
University, is liable to be quashed.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 79
109. W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021 has been filed by the petitioner Dr.Ningthoujam Ram Singh, who is a
retired Professor and Head of Department and acting Dean of the College of Agriculture, Central
Agricultural University having served as Professor for over 19 years, alleging that the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has been appointed as Vice-Chancellor, Manipur Technical University is
not at all qualified/eligible as per the advertisement dated 12.8.2021 itself and the same is also in
violation of the UGC Regulations, 2018.
110. In support of the prayer, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021
submitted that as per the list of AICTE approved Institutes in Engineering and Technology
(Diploma) for the State of Manipur for the academic year 2021-2022, the name of Polytechnic in
which the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram worked has been mentioned, wherefrom it is seen
that the name of the respondent Dr.Bhaneswar Tongbram was shown in the list of faculty of
Government Polytechnic in which he joined as Lecturer on 18.1.1991. He would submit that as per
Section 9 of the Manipur Technical University Act, the University shall strictly adhere to the rules
and regulation, norms and standards, WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.

825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 80 procedures and guidelines etc. of the AICTE as
well as the UGC which are binding on the University.
111. The learned senior counsel further submitted that as per the notification dated 1.3.2019 of the
AICTE, the designation in respect of Diploma Level Institute/Polytechnic is only three which are
Lecturer, Head of Department and Principal. Hence, there is no post of Professor in the Diploma
Level. The experience at Degree Level and Diploma Level are to be considered to be equivalent
provided the scale of pay, etc. are the same for the post. In the instant case, the experience of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram cannot be equated with that of Degree which is apparent from
the pay matrix given in respect of Diploma as well as Degree. In fact, there is huge difference of pay
scale between the two. He added that as per Manipur Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2019, the pay
scale of Deputy Director, Technical Education is equal to that of Foreman of Government
Polytechnic.
112. Going ahead one step further, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Government
Polytechnic is below the grade of even a College. The respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is a
Selection Grade Lecturer, which is equivalent to Associate Professor. Since the Polytechnic is an
Institute for WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No.
807 of 2021 P a g e | 81 teaching only Diploma courses and of any Degree Level, it is not an
academic administrative organisation. Academic administrative means even if a person work in any
other establishment, that establishment must be predominated by academic activities. Therefore,
the Department of Technical Education, Government of Manipur is not an academic administrative
organisation. Since the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is holding the public office, the
petitioner has every right to challenge the validity of his appointment by filing a Writ of
Quo-Warranto in the larger public interest.
113. On the other hand, it is the plea of the respondent Manipur Technical University that the
petitioner Dr.Ningthoujam Ram Singh has not approached this Court with bona fide and in public
interest and it was filed only to over-come the plea of non-maintainability of the other three writ
petitions, namely W.P.(C) Nos.791, 805 and 807 of 2021 and that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram was selected and appointed as per the UGC Regulations, 2018 and as per the Manipur
Technical University Act after he was found suitable for the post of Vice- Chancellor Therefore, there
is no flaw in holding the office of the Vice-Chancellor by Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram. WP(C) No. 805
of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 82
114. The learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram submitted that the petitioner
Dr.Ningtjoujam Ram Singh is proxy of the petitioners in W.P.(C) Nos.791, 805 and 807 of 2021. The
learned counsel further submitted that there is no violation of statutory provision and therefore,
Writ of Quo-Warranto does not lie and on the other hand, since the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram has been selected and appointed after following the procedures laid down for
appointment of Vice-Chancellor, his appointment has to be upheld.
115. It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram
that since the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram was sent on deputation as Deputy Director in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 36
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
the Department of Technical Education, he has been discharging his duty in various Sectors and he
has already have 10 years of experience in the academic administrative organisation with proof of
having demonstrated academic leadership. Besides this, he has also achieved various academic
experience and the exposures at the National and International Level, including research projects.
Therefore, there is no question of non-fulfilment of the eligibility criteria/minimum qualification by
the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of
2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 83 Tongbram. Indeed, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar
Tongbram has possessed requisite qualification for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor and
as per the provisions of law then existed, he was selected and appointed and now holding the public
office. Thus, a prayer has been made to dismiss the writ petition.
116. It is trite law that the power to issue quo-warranto is to be exercised in cases where it is
established that the person whose appointment is under challenge does not possess the requisite
qualification. Writ of quo-warranto can be issued when a person whose appointment is under
challenge does not fulfil the essential qualification and when due process has not been followed even
if such a petition is filed by a stranger.
117. A writ of quo-warranto is a writ which lies against the person, who according to the relator is
not entitled to hold an office of public nature and is only a usurper of the office. It is the person,
against whom the writ of quo-warranto is directed, who is required to show, by what authority that
person is entitled to hold the office. The challenge can be made on various grounds, including on the
grounds that the possessor of the office does not fulfil the required qualifications or suffers from
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 84 any disqualification, which debars the person to hold such office.
118. In the preceding paragraphs, this Court held that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is
not a qualified and eligible person for appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor of Manipur
Technical University. In such view of the matter, as observed by the Apex Court in number of
decisions, the respondent Dr.Bhaneswar Tongbram is debarred from holding the office of the
Vice-Chancellor, Manipur Technical University.
119. A Writ of quo-warranto is not the same as a Writ of Certiorari, or Prohibition or Mandamus and
in a such a proceeding for quo-warranto, it is not necessary for the applicant to establish that he has
been prejudicially affected by any wrongful act of public nature or that his fundamental right is
infringed or that he is denied any legal right or that any legal duty is owed to him. The scope of a
proceeding for quo- warranto is very limited and it is only for the determination, whether the
appointment of the respondent is by a proper authority and in accordance with law, if there is some
express statutory provision.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 85
120. The High Court's power of interference in a proceeding for quo- warranto is also limited and it
cannot act as an appellate authority. Quo-warranto is a remedy given in law at the discretion of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 37
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
Court and is not a proceeding or a writ of course. The High Court can in a proceeding for
quo-warranto, issue an order not only prohibiting an officer from acting in an office to which he is
not entitled, but can also declare the Office to be vacant.
121. It is no doubt true that the strict rules of locus standi are relaxed to an extent in a quo-warranto
proceedings. Nonetheless an imposter coming before the Court invoking public law remedy at the
hands of a Constitutional Court supressing material facts has to be dealt with firmly.
122. In the case on hand, admittedly, no suppression of material facts. The alleged suppression
pleaded by the respondents, particularly the third respondent Dr.Bhaneswar Tongbram, is about the
failure on the part of the petitioners in disclosing the revision petition filed against the judgment
passed in W.A.No.56 of 2019 and orders passed thereon, thereby setting aside the judgment passed
in the writ appeal. The said non-disclosure of the filing of the review petition and WP(C) No. 805 of
2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 86 its
disposal does not have any adverse impact on the instant case.
123. The petitioners have challenged the selection and appointment of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbra as Vice- Chancellor of Manipur Technical University by stating as under:
(i) He does not possess/demonstrated academic leadership as he was neither Head of Department,
nor held any administrative post in any academic administrative organisation.
(ii) His scale of pay is much lower than that of a Professor which is mandatory and should be
equivalent to that of a Professor as per law.
(iii) The Ph.D obtained by the respondent Dr.BhabeswarTongbra is in History which is not
equivalent to Ph.D in Engineering and Technology as per the report of Equivalent Committee of the
Manipur University dated 16.6.2017.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 87
124. Therefore, the contention of the respondent Dr.Bhaneswar Tongbram that the petitioner in
W.P.No.825 of 2021 has not stated specifically which provision of Regulation 7.3 of the UGC
Regulations, 2018 has been violated while appointing the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbra to the
post of Vice-Chancellor is incorrect. Further, all information has been narrated in the pleadings by
the petitioner and the same is not vague and indefinite. That apart, the petitioner has established
the provision of law which attracts the appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhaneswar Tongbra as
illegal.
125. Since the selection and appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is questioned
and it has been proved by the petitioners that the selection and appointment of the respondent
Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is not as per the UGC Regulations, 2018, this Court is of the view that
there is substance in the argument raised by the petitioner in W.P.(C) No.825 of 2021.

126. The Apex Court, in a recent decision in the case of Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi v. State of Gujarat
and others, (2022) 5 SCC 179, held that "in case of any conflict between State legislation and Central
legislation, Central legislation shall prevail by applying the rule/principle of repugnancy as WP(C)
No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e
| 88 enunciated in Article 254 of the Constitution as the subject "education" is in the Concurrent List
(List III) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution". In the said decision, the Apex Court further
observed that "any appointment as a Vice Chancellor contrary to the provisions of the UGC
Regulations can be said to be I violation of the statutory provisions, warranting a writ of quo
warranto".
127. In the case on hand, as discussed and for the reasons stated supra, the appointment of the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of the Manipur Technical University is
contrary to the UGC Regulations, 2018 and also the Manipur Technical University Act, 2016.
128. The 1990 Report of the UGC Committee towards New Educational Management by Professor
A.Gnanam (also called as the Gnanam Committee Report, 1990) accentuated the role of a
Vice-Chancellor, stating that the Vice-Chancellor should be a person with vision and qualities of
academic leadership and with a flair for administration because what the Universities need is a
sensitive, efficient, fair and bold administrator. The Vice-Chancellor should be a distinguished
educationist from the higher education system having highest level of competence, integrity, morals
and self-respect [Vide - WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and
WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 89 Gambhirdan K. Gadhvi v. State of Gujarat and others, (2022) 5
SCC 179]
129. As stated supra, in the case on hand, the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram has not fulfilled
the qualification, experience as stipulated by the UGC Regulations for appointment to the post of
Vice-Chancellor and also to hold the office of the Vice-Chancellor, Manipur Technical University.
Further, nothing has been produced either by the respondent Manipur Technical University or the
respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram to show that the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is
having the highest level of competence, as the role of Vice-Chancellor of Indian Universities has a
paramount importance in the recent times.
130. As held by the Apex Court in number of cases that as Chief Executives and Academic Heads of
Universities, the Vice Chancellors are expected to be efficient and effective in terms of:
a. Implementation of National Higher Education Policy and programmes.
b. Institutional change in tune with the national reforms package.
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021
P a g e | 90 c. Quality and innovation enhancement and their sustainability.
d. Productive engagement with 'communities of scholars' from within their Universities and from
national and international domains.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/7250184/ 39
Shri Mutum Shyamkesho Singh vs The State Of Manipur Represented By on 27 January, 2023
e. Nurturing of 'Research and Innovation Ecosystem' and translation of deliverables to society and
economy.
f. Adoption of international best practices of 'Good Governance.
131. Further, the Vice-Chancellor has to evolve as leader of a symphony of orchestra with the
attributes of:
a. Developing teams and teamwork, building partnerships and collaborations
delicately interwoven by collegiality, friendship and intellectual engagement;
b. Devising a strategy and action plan with defined milestones and deliverables;
c. Ensuring primary accountabilities of self and the abovementioned University
governing bodies; and WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No.
825 of 2021 and WP(C) No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 91 d. Steering an institutional
monitoring and evaluation mechanism on University performance built on principles
of transparency.
132. Thus, it is clear that holding the public office, namely Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical
University by the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram is not in the larger interest of public, as he is
not a qualified and suitable person for holding such post. That apart, Vice-Chancellor is the kingpin
of University's system and a keeper of the University's conscience. It is repeated that his selection
and appointment to the post of Vice-Chancellor, Manipur Technical University is in violation of the
UGC Regulations, 2018 and the Manipur Technical University Act. Therefore, W.P.(C) No.825 of
2021 succeeds.
133. For all the reasons stated above, this Court is of the view that the petitioners have established
their case for interference in the impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021, selection and
appointment of the respondent Dr.Bhabeswar Tongbram as Vice-Chancellor of Manipur Technical
University vide order dated 8.11.2021.
RESULT:
WP(C) No. 805 of 2021, WP(C) No. 791 of 2021, WP(C) No. 825 of 2021 and WP(C)
No. 807 of 2021 P a g e | 92
134. In fine,
(i) W.P.(C) Nos.791, 805, 807 and 825 of 2021 are allowed.
(ii) The impugned advertisement dated 12.8.2021 and the recruitment process initiated pursuant to
