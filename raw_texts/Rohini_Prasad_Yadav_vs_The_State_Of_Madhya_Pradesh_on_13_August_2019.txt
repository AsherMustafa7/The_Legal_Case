Shri Siddharth Gulatee, Shri Indrajeet Yadav, Shri Tabrez Khan, Shri
Neeraj Singh, Shri Sanjeev Kumar Chansoriya, Shri U.S.Jaiswal, Shri Harish
Shukla, Shri S.Baig, Shri S.D.Mishra, and Shri V.P.Kushwaha, learned
counsel for the petitioners.
Shri Bhupesh Tiwari, learned Government Advocate for the
respondents/State.
The petitioners who are working as Guest Teacher in the School Education Department has filed the
present petition, seeking a direction to permit the petitioners to perform their duties as Guest
Teacher in their respective schools and to continue them till the regular selection is made. It is also
contended that the respondents cannot initiate a fresh process of selection of Guest Teachers on
vacant posts in Govt. Schools for academic Session 2019-2020 in pursuant to circular dated
07-07-2018.
Learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to an interim order d at ed 17-07-2019, passed by a
Coordinate Bench of this court in W.P.No.12892/2019 after referring the judgment in the case of
Saurabh Singh Baghel and others Vs. State of M.P. and others 2019(1) MPLJ, The issues raised in
the present petition have already been decided finally by a Division Bench of this court in the case of
Saurabh Singh Baghel (supra). In the said batch of petitions, the grievance of the petitioners was
that all the guest teachers who have been working for many years have been disengaged because
they are not found to be in the merit list as there are more meritorious candidates who have applied
for appointment as Guest Teachers and they have a right to continue in the school in which they
were initially engaged and by the process adopted by the respondents they cannot 2 WP-15862-2019
be shifted to another place. In those petitions, a challenge was also made to the circular dated
07-07-2018 issued by the State Government regarding engagement of the guest teachers by
adopting a transparent method of engaging the guest teachers on the basis of merit.
The Division Bench in the case of Saurabh Singh Baghel (supra) held in para-25 that the method of
engaging Guest Teachers in pursuance to circular dated 07-07-2018 cannot be said to be illegal and
arbitrary. It was also held in para-15 that no direction can be issued that the Guest Teachers, who
are not meritorious enough should be engaged for teaching the students of Government schools.
The relevant paras 15 and 25 are reproduced as under :

Rohini Prasad Yadav vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 13 August, 2019
"1.5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and find that no direction can be
issued that the Guest Teachers, who are not meritorious enough, should be engaged
for teaching the students of Government Schools.
2.5. The State has large number of schools and also equally large number of students.
Such large numbers of students are to be provided with quality education. It is the
responsibility of the State that the teachers, who shape the future of country, are
meritorious and appointed through a transparent system and not by the process
adopted by the Local School Level Committee or the Parents Teacher Association.
The method of engaging Guest Teachers in pursuance to Circular dated 07.07.2018
cannot be said to be illegal or arbitrary, which may warrant interference in the writ
jurisdiction of this Court."
The following directions were issued in the said case in para 27 which are reproduced as under:
"27. Since there are large number of vacancies in the Government Schools of the
State, which is evident from the fact that this year 70,000 Guest Teachers are to be
engaged, therefore, to give effect to Right to Education Act and that there should not
be any ad hocismin engaging the teachers for teaching students in the schools of the
State, we issue the following directions:-
( i ) The State Government shall frame policy for
3 WP-15862-2019 filling the posts of Teachers in the State in a phased manner, to be completed in
five years after framing of the policy.
(ii) Such policy shall be uploaded on the website of the State Government within four months from
the date of order of this Court;
(iii) The vacancies, if any, of the Guest Teachers engaged in pursuance to the Circular dated
07.07.2018, shall be filled up on the basis of merit list school-wise already prepared;
(iv) If the merit list is exhausted, then fresh options would be invited school-wise from the
registered candidates in the same manner as has been done in pursuance of circular dated
07.07.2018."
I n view of the above, we deem it proper to dispose of the present petition with liberty to the
petitioners to submit a representation before the respondents within a period of 10 days from today
and if such a representation is submitted within the aforesaid period, the competent authority shall
consider and decide the representation keeping in view the directions issued by this court in the case
of Saurabh Singh Baghel (supra). It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the
merit of the case.
Accordingly, the petition is disposed of.
