date of completion of six years as per the Government Works Department Resolution no.16200
dated 22.09.2008 which has been done in case of Diploma Engineers (Civil) working in other
departments and grant all consequential service benefits within a stipulated time.
3. Mr. M. Mishra, learned Senior Counsel appearing along with Mr. T. Mishra, learned counsel for
the petitioner contended that vide letter dated 12.11.2021 under Annexure-10 the Addl. Secretary to
Government has intimated the vacancy position of the Water Resources Department wherein it has
been indicated that there are availability of 440 vacancies out of which ST-143, SC-40, SEBC-00 and
UR-257. Therefore, the petitioners those who are rendering service and completed six years of
service, they are entitled to be regularized against the vacancies made available. But instead of doing
so, the opposite parties are going to fill up the posts by fresh recruitment, which will cause prejudice
to the petitioners and, as such, by this process, their services may not be regularized by the
authority.
