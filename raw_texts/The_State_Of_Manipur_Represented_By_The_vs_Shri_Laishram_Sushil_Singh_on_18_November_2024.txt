subjected to judicial review unless the same has
been malafide or based on extraneous or
irrelevant grounds as held by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Union of India-Vs-

present case, there is no finding in the
impugned judgment and order that the
dismissal order was issued in malafide or
extraneous or irrelevant grounds;
(ix) The writ petitioner's conduct is a threat to the
security of the State as he could have been
deliberately planted by the prescribed

case or pending departmental enquiry against
the Writ Petitioner will not make any difference

correctness or veracity of the allegations. The
fact remains that there were certain allegations
of serious nature. And such allegations have far
reaching implications for the security of the
State;
(xii) While examining an order issued for dismissing
a person by invoking clause (c) to Second
Proviso to Clause (2) of Article 311 of the
Constitution, the Court cannot look the
sufficiency or correctness of materials and also
about the relevancy as long as some materials
are found relevant which forms the subjective
satisfaction;
(xiii) Pendency of criminal proceedings/ under
investigation is a different aspect and it does
P a g e 7 | 103
not debarred the state in taking action under
Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India.
(xiv) There is no infirmity in the order dated 13-07-
2017 dismissing the petitioner from service in
the interest of the Security of the State by

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[10] The operative portions of the impugned judgment and
order dated 27.01.2020 passed in W.P.(C) No. 591 of 2017 are
reproduced herein below:
"[31] In view of the fact that no material had been placed
by the respondent State to satisfy the Court that the
impugned dismissal order was passed in security
interest, this Court is of the opinion that the
impugned order cannot be sustained in the eye of
law and also on the ground that already
P a g e 12 | 103
departmental proceedings as well as criminal
prosecution are stated to be pending against the
petitioner. For the foregoing discussion, the
impugned order is liable to be set aside.
[32] Accordingly,
(a) the writ petition is allowed and the order of
dismissal dated 13.07.2017 passed by the
first respondent is set aside;
(b) the respondent authorities are directed to
reinstate the petitioner into service and give
posting other than the post which he was
holding prior to the order of dismissal;
c) the period from the date of dismissal to the
date of reinstatement shall be considered as
period rendered in service for the purposes of
pensioner benefits, if any."
[11] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Deputy Advocate General
appearing for the appellants submitted that vide order dated
17.12.2019, the writ petition being W.P.(C) No. 591 of 2017 was
allowed and set aside the dismissal order dated 13.07.2017. In
setting aside the dismissal order which dismissed the writ petitioner
by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, the
conclusion drawn by the Ld. Single Judge passed in W.P.(C) No. 591
of 2021 are as follows:
"(i) The Governor has to be satisfied personally that in
the interest of the security of the State, it was not
expedient to hold the enquiry as contemplated under
Article 311(2) second proviso, clause (c) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 12
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Constitution of India and such power cannot be
delegated to any other authority.
(ii) Further, the Committee of Advisors made necessary
recommendation for taking up action under Article
311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India and the
Governor merely approved the recommendation
made by the Committee, which in fact not in
accordance with law contemplated under Article
311(c) of the Constitution of India.
P a g e 13 | 103
(iii) The Governor had merely approved the
recommendation of the Committee of Advisors. Mere
expressing approval to the recommendation of the
Committee of Advisors is not in accordance with the
law.
(iv) The impugned dismissal order cannot be sustained
as no material had been placed by the respondent
State to satisfy the Court that the impugned
dismissal order was passed in security interest and
moreover, departmental proceedings as well as
criminal prosecution are pending against the
petitioner."
[12] Mr. H. Debendra, learned Dy. Advocate General
appearing for the appellants submitted that under the Constitutional
Law, the satisfaction of the Governor as envisaged in Article 311(2)
second proviso, clause (c) of the Constitution is not the personal
satisfaction of the Governor, but the satisfaction to be arrived with
the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. The learned Dy.
Advocate General referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court passed in Shamsher Singh V. Union of India &Ors. [(1974) 2
SCC 831]. The relevant Para No. 48 of the judgment is extracted
below:
"48. The President as well as the Governor is the
Constitutional or formal head. The President as well as the
Governor exercises his powers and functions conferred on
him by or under the Constitution on the aid and advice of
his Council of Ministers, save in spheres where the governor
is required by or under the Constitution to exercise his
functions in his discretion. Wherever the Constitution
requires the satisfaction of the President or the Governor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 13
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
for the exercise by the President or the Governor of any
power or function, the satisfaction required by the
Constitution is not the personal satisfaction of the President
or Governor but the satisfaction of the President or
Governor in the constitutional sense in the Cabinet system
of Government, that is, satisfaction of his Council of
Ministers on whose aid and advice the President or the
P a g e 14 | 103
Governor generally exercises all his powers and functions. The
decision of any Minister or Officer under Rules of Business
made under any of these two Articles 77(3) and 166(3) is
the decision of the President or the Governor respectively.
These articles did not provide for any delegation. Therefore,
the decision of Minister or officer under the Rules of
Business is the decision of the President or the Governor."
It is true that the satisfaction required by the
Constitution is not the personal satisfaction of the President or
Governor; but the satisfaction of the President or Governor is in the
constitutional sense in the cabinet system of Government, the
satisfaction of his council of ministers on whose advice, the
President or Governor exercise his power of function likewise in the
case for invocation of Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India,
the satisfaction of the Governor is subjective satisfaction, but the
subjective satisfaction is to be arrived at on the basis of objective
satisfaction of the disciplinary authority based on reliable materials
i.e. dossiers, reports, records etc. But, in the instant case, there is
no reliable material placed before the disciplinary authority to make
the recommendation for invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the
Constitution of India.
[13] It has been submitted that as per the Rules of
Business or any other provisions of law or under the relevant office
memorandum dated 16.08.2008, it is not required for the Governor
to put up his personal opinion or reasons for arriving at his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 14
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
subjective satisfaction as contemplated under Article 311(2) second
proviso, clause (c) of the Constitution of India. And, it is only when
P a g e 15 | 103
the Governor disagree with the proposal/recommendation of the
Committee of Advisors and proposal of the Hon'ble Chief Minister,
that he is to give reasons and not otherwise.
It has also been submitted that after due consideration
and examination of the reports, records and dossiers submitted by
the Home Department, the Committee of Advisors constituted under
the office memorandum dated 16.08.2008 came to the conclusion
that the writ petitioner willingly indulged in the activities of the
banned unlawful organisation, PLA/RPF which are prejudicial to the
security of the State and recommended for dismissal of the
petitioner from service by invoking Article 311(2) second proviso,
clause (c) of the Constitution, the proposal/recommendation was
placed before the Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Governor for
approval. The Governor being satisfied with the recommendation of
Committee of Advisors and proposal of the Chief Minister, approved
the recommendation on 24.04.2017. After approval of the Governor,
as per rule the Under Secretary (Home), Government of Manipur in
the name of the Governor issued the order dated 13.07.2017
dismissing the writ petitioner with immediate effect in the interest of
the security of the State.
[14] As directed by us, the appellant/State produced the
confidential file containing the recommendation of the Committee of

Article 311 (2) Second Proviso, Clause (c) of the Constitution of
India which was verified and vetted by the Home Department,
Government of Manipur. We perused the confidential file and on
perusal of the same, it was found that in the notes, the Hon'ble
Governor put only "may be approved" without expressing its
satisfaction to the recommendation made by the disciplinary
authority and the materials annexed therein in the confidential file.
Mention may be made here that the Governor in this process is the
final authority and as such, we are of the opinion that "may be
approved" is not a final order/opinion.

the extreme steps for dismissing the writ petitioner/respondent was
taken are extracted herein below:-

[15] Seen the documents mentioned above and the
writing/opinion expressed by the disciplinary authority in the notes

the accused person have communicated with the mobile number 9191703131 which belongs to
Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha of Kakwa Nameirakpam Leikai, the Commander of the Auxiliary
Battalion of RPF/PLA."
[16] The contents of the allegation made herein above are the grounds for the dismissal of the writ
petitioner/respondent. Throughout the correspondence made from the SDPO (supra) to the notes
placed before the Committee of Advisors, thereafter the Committee of Advisors after going through
the file recommended for dismissing the writ petitioner/respondent from service by resorting to
Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, the Committee's recommendation along with material
placed before them was placed P a g e 24 | 103 before the Hon'ble Chief Minister and finally to the
Hon'ble Governor. The Hon'ble Governor, while putting up the file, gave approval by putting "may
be approved", for taking the extreme action for dismissal of the writ petitioner/respondent by taking
recourse to Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution. [17] The minutes of the meeting of the Committee
of Advisors held on 24.04.2017 at 11:00 a.m. are extracted hereunder:
"1. ............................................................................
2. The Committee of Advisors examined the Home Department "Note for Committee
of Advisers containing proposal regarding dismissal of Sub-Inspector L. Sushil Singh
(35) S/o L. Birendrakumar Singh of Nagamapal Singjubung Leikai under Article
311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India" for his involvement in subversive activities.
3. The Committee noted that as per the Secret Report of the Manipur Police
Department vide letter No. 5/3/2015- INT/606 dated 5/12/2015, Sub-Inspector L.
Sushil Singh was arrested on 22/01/2016 for his involvement in pre- judicial
activities and a regular case under FIR No. 21(1)2015 U/s 38(1) UA(P) Act and 5(b)
Official Secret Act was registered against him. He has had close link with one
Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha of Kakwa Nameirakpam Leikai, the Commander of
Auxiliary Battalion of PLA/RPF. He provided secret and vital official information to
Ahingcha. He is apparently involved in unlawful organisation (PLA/RPF) with an
ulterior motive and to wage against the Government, thereby indulging in criminal
activities.

5. Moreover, he had visited Moreh and met members of terrorist organization to further their
prejudicial activities. Investigation so far reveals that he is a professional criminal involved in
various cases. He admitted that he disclosed about VIP/VVIP's movement to the UGs outfit." and
thereafter, taken a decision at para Nos. 6 to 9 and the same are extracted hereunder:
"6. That the gravity of the crime is such that its impact is debasing to the discipline moral of the
forces and promoting insecurity among the public and posing the immediate threat to the security of
the Department as well as to the State. If such activities are stopped in an exemplary manner, it may
set a precedent on the other police personnel not to indulge in such activities.
7. His continuation in service may threat to the security of the State and appropriate steps may be
taken up to dismiss SI L. Sushil Singh of CID(SB) under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution for his
involvement with unlawful organisations and engagement in subversive activities, without holding
Department enquiry as it is not expedient to conduct Departmental enquiry in the interest of the
security of the State.
8. The Committee after considering all the details placed before it regarding the activities of L.
Sushil Singh, Sub-Inspector of CID(SB) Branch is satisfied that the accused official has willingly
indulged in the activities of an organisation declared unlawful which are prejudicial to the security
of the State. As such, it is considered not advisable to disclose the allegations against him or to call
upon replies thereto.
9. The Committee Advisers, therefore, decided to recommend dismissal of L. Sushil Singh,
Sub-Inspector of CID(SB) from service under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as it is not
expedient to hold Departmental Enquiry in the interest of security of the State as the prejudicial
activities are affecting the security of the State."

the I.O. of the case dated 24.01.2015 is extracted herein below:

"While in the Manipur Central Jail Sajiwa, I became familiar with one UTP namely
Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha @ Roi of Kwakeithel Nameirakpam, Leikai, S/S Sgt.,
now P a g e 26 | 103 Commander of the Auxiliary Battalion of PLA. During those days
Shri S. Bobby @ Ahingcha requested me to help in their struggle to secede the State
of Manipur from the Union of India after release from the jail. As such, I gave
consent to help them in future as I was deeply rooted in the approaching struggle to
secede the State of Manipur from the Union of India by waging war against the
Government. Since the third week of December, 2014, I frequently communicated
with Shri S. Bobby Singh @ Ahingcha through internet social networking (Facebook).
Later we have exchanged our mobile numbers and started to pass on secret and vital
information to Ahingcha for carrying out further activities. I contacted from mobile
nos. 9612517847 & 8132818550 with Shri S. Bobby @ Ahinghcha under his no.
9191703131 saved as code name Sagolsem Rointa. Over and above, I passed on
information about the movement of security forces, places of Counter insurgency
operations to be carried out by the security forces, top secret official information
more related to PLA/RPF organisation etc. I carried out similar task till my arrest."
On perusal of the steps taken by the State
Government from the date of arrest of the writ
petitioner/respondent till his dismissal from service by invoking Article 311(2)(c), it
is seen and evident that the writ petitioner/respondent was arrested on 22.01.2015
placed under suspension on 24.01.2015 and after one year, initiated departmental
inquiry vide order dated 22.02.2016. The inquiry officer and presenting officer were
appointed vide orders dated 22.02.2016 and 27.02.2016. The writ petitioner
participated in the departmental inquiry and after receiving signal dated 19.09.2016
and 19.11.2016, the writ petitioner submitted written argument to the inquiry
authority on 05.12.2016.The writ petitioner submitted representation dated
04.05.2017 seeking for reinstatement on the P a g e 27 | 103 ground that more than 2
(two) years [two and half years] have passed. In the midst of that, the State
Government issued dismissal order dated 13.07.2017 by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of
the Constitution. In the detailed report of the SDPO, Imphal West proposing to take
steps for dismissal of the writ petitioner/respondent, some of the relevant portions
are extracted herein above.
[19] On perusal of the above extracted minutes of the meeting of the Committee of
Advisors, it is seen that the Committee's resolution was taken on the basis of the
secret report of Manipur Police Department at Para No. 3 and on that basis, the
Committee formed their opinion on Para No. 6 to 9 and recommended to take
recourse to Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution of India for dismissal of the writ
petitioner/respondent from service.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 25
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
On this recommendation and secret report as extracted above of the Police
Department, the Hon'ble Governor has written in the note "may be approved".
[20] On further perusal of the above extracted Para No. 3, we are of the view that the disciplinary
authority failed to mention the exact involvement of the writ petitioner in prejudicial activities and
involvement of the writ petitioner/respondent in unlawful activities with the unlawful organization
(PLA/RPF) with an ulterior motive to wage war against the Government and indulgence of the P a g
e 28 | 103 writ petitioner in criminal activities and failed to establish that he has closely worked with
one Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha, Kakwa Nameirakpam Leikai, the Commander of Auxiliary
Battalion of PLA/RPF and his providing secret and vital information to the said Ahingcha.
From perusal of the whole sequence of the developments from the registration of FIR to the
culmination in writ petitioner's dismissal under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, it
comes out clearly that the view of the disciplinary authority swung from one extreme to another
extreme. The reasons/grounds for resorting to such extraordinary step of dismissal, by practically
forgoing the laid down procedure, are solely based on the internally generated report i.e. FIR report
and the statements extracted from the writ petitioner/respondent, during the police custody with no
apparent further efforts made by the police to corroborate the said report and statement. Whatever
mentioned as the ground for taking extreme step for dismissing the writ petitioner are just an
allegation which was alleged by the investigating authority during the investigation and the
internally generated report.
23. In Kuldip Singh v. State of Punjab, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that : (SCC pp 662-63, para
7) "7. At our direction made on 22-4-1996 in this matter, the learned counsel for the State has
produced the original record relating to the appellant's dismissal along with translated copies of the
relevant document placed before us by the learned counsel for the State is the copy of P a g e 29 |
103 FIR No. 219 of 1990 dated 24-11-1990. It is based upon the statement of Head Constable Hardev
Singh, who was posted as gunman with Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of Police (SP)
(Operations). The FIR speaks of the jeep (in which the said SP was travelling along with certain
police personnel) being blown up killing the said SP and few other police officials. The next
document placed before us is the case diary pertaining to the said crime containing the statement of
the appellant, Kuldip Singh. In his statement, Kuldip Singh did clearly state about his association
with certain named militants, the plot laid by them to kill Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of
Police, Tarn Taran by placing a bomb and the manner in which they carried out the said plot. He
also stated that he and his militant companions planned to plant a bomb in the office of SSP, Tarn
Taran but that the police officers came to know of the said plan, thus foiling their plan. The learned
counsel for the State of Punjab did concede that except the aforesaid statement of
admission/confession of the appellant, there was no other material on which the appellant could be
held guilty of conduct warranting dismissal from service. Accordingly, we are of the considered view
that there were no reliable material before the Committee of Advisors to arrive at their satisfaction
that the writ petitioner has willingly indulged in the activities of an organization declared unlawful
which are prejudicial to the security of the State and as such, we cannot give our approval to his
subsequent dismissal under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 26
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[21] We are also unable to agree with the Hon'ble Governor giving his/her assent by just writing
"may be approved" without expressing subjective satisfaction to the recommendation of the
disciplinary authority which is against the dicta of the Hon'ble P a g e 30 | 103 Supreme Court.
Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution being the special provision for resorting to this extreme step, extra
care is to be taken in taking this extreme step under Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution of India. This is
a Constitutional obligation and if such reason is not recorded in writing, the order dispensing with
the inquiry and order of penalty following thereupon would both be void and unconstitutional. The
Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution in itself says that no person who is a member of Civil Service of
Union of India or all India service or Civil Service of a State shall be dismissed or removed without
giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard of the charges. In the present case, the authority
dismissed the writ petitioner under Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution of India of which, the same is
reproduced herein again for convenient sake:
"(c) Where the President or the Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the
interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold such inquiry."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Southern Railways at Para No.19 observed as thus:
"19. The second proviso appended to Article 311, however, makes three exceptions in
regard to constitutional requirement to hold an inquiry, clause (b) whereof provides
that in a case where the disciplinary authority is satisfied that it is not reasonably
practicable to hold such inquiry, subject of course to the condition that reasons
therefor are to be recorded in writing. Recording of reasons, thus, provides adequate
protection and safeguard to the employee concerned. It is now well settled that
reasons so recorded must be cogent and sufficient. Satisfaction to be arrived at by P a
g e 31 | 103 the disciplinary authority for the aforementioned purpose cannot be
arbitrary. It must be based on objectivity."
[22] From the foregoing observation made by us, we are of the view that the disciplinary authority
failed to put up reliable materials before the Hon'ble Governor for arriving at his subjective
satisfaction for giving his approval and that the disciplinary authority also failed to mention the
departmental inquiry which was ensued more than 1 (one) year after the registration of FIR and the
stage of the inquiry where the writ petitioner/respondent already submitted his written argument.
The authority failed to clarify and convince the Hon'ble Governor that in spite of holding
departmental inquiry for a quite long time and it is not expedient for them to hold further inquiry,
concealment of this fact alone is the commission of malafide on the part of the disciplinary
authority.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. Tulsiram Patel at para Nos. 130, 133 &
134 held as under:
"130. ............ It is because the disciplinary authority is the best judge of this that
clause (3) of Article 311 makes the decision of the disciplinary authority on this
question final. A disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 27
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
inquiry lightly or arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the
holding of an inquiry or because the Department's case against the government
servant is weak and must fail. The finality given to the decision of the disciplinary
authority by Article 311 (3) is not binding upon the court so far as its power of judicial
review is concerned and in such a case court will strike down the order dispensing
with the inquiry as also the order imposing penalty.
P a g e 32 | 103
133. The second condition necessary for the valid application of clause (b) of the second proviso is
that the disciplinary authority should record in writing its reason for its satisfaction that it was not
reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry contemplated by Article 311 (2). This is a constitutional
obligation and if such reason is not recorded in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and
the order of penalty following thereupon would both the void and unconstitutional.
134. It is obvious that the recording in writing of the reason for dispensing with the inquiry must
precede the order imposing the penalty. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not,
therefore, find a place in the final order. It would be usual to record the reason separately and then
consider the question of the penalty to be imposed and pass the order imposing the penalty. It
should, however, be better to record the reason in the final order in order to avoid the allegation that
the reason was not recorded in writing before passing the final order but was subsequently
fabricated. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not contain detailed particulars, but the
reason must not be vague or just a repetition of the language of clause (b) of the second proviso. For
instance, it would be no compliance with the requirement of clause (b) for the disciplinary authority
simply to state that he was satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable to hold any inquiry."
24. This Court in Union of India v. R. Reddappa held as under: (SCC p. 274, para 5) "5. More than a
decade has gone by since these employees were dismissed for participating in strike called by the
Union recognised by the Railways.
.................................................................. ..................................................................
.................................................................. ........................................................ We are not impressed
by the vehement submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the CAT, Hyderabad
exceeded its jurisdiction in recording the finding that there was no material in support of the finding
that it was not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry. The jurisdiction to exercise the power
under Rule 14(ii) was dependent on existence of this primary fact. If there was no material on which
any reasonable person could have come to the conclusion as is envisaged in the Rule then P a g e 33
| 103 the action was vitiated due to erroneous assumption of jurisdictional fact therefore the
Tribunal was well within its jurisdiction to set aside the orders on this ground. An illegal order
passed by the disciplinary authority does not assume the character of legality only because it has
been affirmed in appeal or revision unless the higher authority is found to have applied its mind to
the basic infirmities in the order. Mere reiteration or repetition instead of adding strength to the
order renders it weaker and more vulnerable as even the higher authority constituted under the Act
or the rules for proper appraisal shall be deemed to have failed in discharge of its statutory

obligation.
[23] The learned Deputy Advocate General, further, submits that the Call Detail Records (CDR) and
other incriminating materials on record against the writ petitioner/respondent are sufficient to
arrive at the subjective satisfaction of the authority that it was not expedient to hold enquiry for
dismissing the writ petitioner / respondent and it is not for the Court to examine the adequacy or
otherwise of materials with which the Governor arrived at his subjective satisfaction that it was not
expedient to hold an enquiry in the interest of the security of the State.
As observed earlier by us, the authority failed to convince / exhibit the criteria laid down in the
provision as well as the dicta laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the authority put up the
incriminating materials on record for objective satisfaction and for subsequent subjective approval
of the Hon'ble Governor.
P a g e 34 | 103 The relevant portion of the minutes of the meeting of the Committee of Advisors is
hereunder extracted -
"6. That the gravity of the crime is such that its impact is debasing to the discipline moral of the
forces and promoting insecurity among the public and posing the immediate threat to the security of
the Department as well as to the State. If such activities are stopped in an exemplary manner, it may
set a precedent on the other police personnel not to indulge in such activities.
7. His continuation in service may threat to the security of the State and appropriate steps may be
taken up to dismiss SI L. Sushil Singh of CID(SB) under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution for his
involvement with unlawful organisations and engagement in subversive activities, without holding
Department enquiry as it is not expedient to conduct Departmental enquiry in the interest of the
security of the State.
8. The Committee after considering all the details placed before it regarding the activities of L.
Sushil Singh, Sub-Inspector of CID(SB) Branch is satisfied that the accused official has willingly
indulged in the activities of an organisation declared unlawful which are prejudicial to the security
of the State. As such, it is considered not advisable to disclose the allegations against him or to call
upon replies thereto.
9. The Committee Advisers, therefore, decided to recommend dismissal of L. Sushil Singh,
Sub-Inspector of CID(SB) from service under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as it is not
expedient to hold Departmental Enquiry in the interest of security of the State as the prejudicial
activities are affecting the security of the State."
The relevant portion of the office memorandum dated 11.11.1985 at Para No. 9 of the office
memorandum is extracted herein below:
"9. As regards action under clause (c) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2) of the
Constitution, what is required under this clause is the satisfaction of the President or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 29
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
the Governor, as the case may be, that in the interest of the security of the State, it is
not expedient to hold an inquiry as contemplated by Art. 311(2). This satisfaction is of
the President or the Governor as a constitutional authority P a g e 35 | 103 arrived at
with the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers. The satisfaction so reached by the
President or the Governor is necessarily a subjective satisfaction. The reasons for this
satisfaction need not be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in
rank, nor can it be made public. There is no provision for departmental appeal or
other departmental remedy against the satisfaction reached by the President or the
Governor. If, however, the inquiry has been dispensed with by the President or the
Governor and the order of penalty has been passed by disciplinary authority revision
will lie. In such an appeal or revision, the civil servant can ask for an inquiry to be
held into his alleged conduct, unless at the time of the hearing of the appeal or
revision a situation envisaged by the second proviso to Article 311(2) is prevailing.
Even in such a situation, the hearing of the appeal or revision application should be
postponed for a reasonable length of time for the situation to become normal.
Ordinarily the satisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, would not be a
matter for judicial review. However, if it is alleged that the satisfaction of the
President or Governor, as the case may be, had been reached mala fide, or was based
on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds, the matter will become subject to judicial
review because, in such a case, there would be no satisfaction, in law, of the President
or the Governor at all. The question whether the court may compel the Government
to disclose the materials to examine whether the satisfaction was arrived at mala fide,
or based on extraneous or irrelevant grounds, would depend upon the nature of the
documents in question i.e. whether they fall within the class of privileged documents
or whether in respect of them privilege has been properly claimed or not."
[24] It is settled principle of law that the decision/proposal of the disciplinary authority for
dismissal of the writ petitioner/respondent under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India
should be objective satisfaction basing on sufficient materials of fact and law in the present case, we
are of the view that this criteria is not fulfilled by the disciplinary authority.
P a g e 36 | 103 As observed earlier by us, the objective satisfaction of the disciplinary authority were
not as per the provision as well as the dicta of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and as such, we are not
agreeable to the submission that the satisfaction was based on sufficient materials of fact and law.
Accordingly, we are of the considered view that the recommendation of the disciplinary authority for
invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India and the subsequent approval of the Governor
are malafide. [25] The learned Deputy Advocate General submits that the decision taken for
dismissing the writ petitioner/respondent under Article 311(2)(c) is not subjected to judicial review
as there was no malafide or extraneous consideration as in Tulsiram Patel's case (1985) 3 SCC
398[Para No. 142], the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that -
"142. The question under clause (c), however, is not whether the security of the State
has been affected or not, for the expression used in clause (c) is "in the interest of the
security of the State". The interest of the security of the State may be affected by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 30
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
actual acts or even the likelihood of such acts taking place. Further, what is required
under clause
(c) is not the satisfaction of the President or the Governor, as the case may be, that
the interest of the security of the State is or will be affected but his satisfaction that in
the interest of the security of the State; it is not expedient to hold an inquiry as
contemplated by Article 311(2). The satisfaction of the President or Governor must,
therefore, be with respect to the expediency or inexpediency of holding an inquiry in
the interest of the security of the State.
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition, defines the word 'inexpedient' as meaning
"not expedient' disadvantageous in the circumstances, P a g e 37 | 103 unadvisable, impolite". The
same dictionary defines 'expedient' as meaning inter alia "advantageous; fit, proper, or suitable to
the circumstances of the case". Webster's Third New International Dictionary also defines the terms
'expedient' as meaning inter alia "characterized by suitability, practicality, and efficiency in
achieving a particular end: fit, proper, or advantageous under the circumstances". It must be borne
in mind that the satisfaction required by clause (c) is of the Constitutional Head of the whole
country or of the State. Under Article 74(1) of the Constitution, the satisfaction of the President
would be arrived at with the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as
the Head and in the case of a State by reason of the provisions of Article 163(1) by the Governor in
the constitutional sense is satisfied that it will not be advantageous or fit or proper or suitable or
politic in the interest of the security of the State to hold an inquiry, he would be entitled to dispense
with it under clause (c). The satisfaction so reached by the President or the Governor must
necessarily be a subjective satisfaction. Expediency involves matters of policy. Satisfaction may be
arrived at as a result of secret information received by the Government about the brewing danger to
the security of the State and like matters. There may be other factors which may be required
satisfaction whether holding an inquiry would be expedient or not. If the requisite satisfaction has
been reached as a result of secret information received by the Government, weighed and balanced in
order to reach the requisite satisfaction whether holding an inquiry would be expedient or not. If the
requisite satisfaction has been reached as a result of secret information received by the Government,
making known such information may very often result in disclosure of the source of such
information. Once known, the particular source from which the information was received would no
more be available to the Government. The reasons for the satisfaction reached by the President or
Governor under clause
(c) cannot, therefore, be required to be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in
rank nor can they be made public."
[26] However, in the instant case, it is to be mentioned that suspension order was issued on
24.01.2015 and the memorandum dated 22.02.2016 was issued on 22.02.2016 for departmental P a
g e 38 | 103 inquiry against the writ petitioner i.e. after the lapse of 1 (one) year of his suspension,
vide orders dated 22.02.2016 and 27.02.2016, the inquiry officer and presenting officer were
appointed respectively. Written statement of defence was submitted on 03.03.2016 and the
supplementary written statement of defence was also submitted on 12.09.2016. The writ petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 31
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
appeared before the Presiding Officer of the DE and the written argument to the inquiry authority
was submitted on 05.12.2016. The dismissal from service by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the
Constitution of India was issued on 13.07.2017.
[27] In the facts and circumstances, we are not inclined to agree with the submission made above by
the learned counsel appearing for the appellant that it is not expedient to hold inquiry and the
authority has taken the decision to dismiss the writ petitioner/respondent from service by invoking
Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution.
We are of the considered view that the information received/submitted is/are not reliable enough to
come to the satisfaction that it is not expedient to hold an inquiry as contemplated by Article 311(2).
The satisfaction of the President or Governor must, therefore, be with respect to the expediency or
inexpediency of holding an inquiry in the interest of the security of the State.
P a g e 39 | 103 In this regard the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Tulsiram Patel's case (1985) 3 SCC
398observed at para No. 130, 133 & 134:
"130. ................ It is because the disciplinary authority is the best judge of this that
clause (3) of Article 311 makes the decision of the disciplinary authority on this
question final. A disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary
inquiry lightly or arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the
holding of an inquiry or because the Department's case against the government
servant is weak and must fail. The finality given to the decision of the disciplinary
authority by Article 311(3) is not binding upon the court so far as its power of judicial
review is concerned and in such a case the court will strike down the order dispensing
with the inquiry as also the order imposing penalty.
133. The second condition necessary for the valid application of clause (b) of the
second proviso is that the disciplinary authority should record in writing its reason
for its satisfaction that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry
contemplated by Article 311(2). This is a constitutional obligation and if such reason
is not recorded in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and the order of
penalty following thereupon would both be void and unconstitutional.
134. It is obvious that the recording in writing of the reason for dispensing with the
inquiry must precede the order imposing the penalty. The reason for dispensing with
the inquiry need not, therefore, find a place in the final order. It would be usual to
record the reason separately and then consider the question of the penalty to be
imposed and pass the order imposing the penalty. It would, however, be better to
record the reason in the final order in order to avoid the allegation that the reason
was not recorded in writing before passing the final order but was subsequently
fabricated. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not contain detailed
particulars, but the reason must not be vague or just a repetition of the language of
clause (b) of the second proviso. For instance, it would be no compliance with the P a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 32
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
g e 40 | 103 requirement of clause (b) for the disciplinary authority simply to state
that he was satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable to hold any inquiry."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Southern Railways at Para No.19 observed as thus:
"19. The second proviso appended to Article 311, however, makes three exceptions in
regard to constitutional requirement to hold an inquiry, clause (b) whereof provides
that in a case where the disciplinary authority is satisfied that it is not reasonably
practicable to hold such inquiry, subject of course to the condition that reasons
therefor are to be recorded in writing. Recording of reasons, thus, provides adequate
protection and safeguard to the employee concerned. It is now well settled that
reasons so recorded must be cogent and sufficient. Satisfaction to be arrived at by the
disciplinary authority for the aforementioned purpose cannot be arbitrary. It must be
based on objectivity."
Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Southern Railway Officers' Assn. V. Union of India &Ors.
[(2009) 9 SCC 24] observed at Para No. 22, 23, 24, 25 & 26 that -
"22. In Satyavir Singh v. Union of India, this Court held :
(SCC p. 288, para 21) "21. The point which was next urged in support of the
contention that the impugned orders were passed mala fide was that even though
co-workers may not have been available as witnesses, there were policemen and
police officers posted inside and outside the building and they were available to give
evidence and that superior officers were also available to give evidence. The crucial
and material evidence against the appellants would be that of their co-workers for
these co-workers were directly concerned in and were eyewitnesses to the various
incidents. Where the disciplinary authority feels that crucial and material evidence
will not be available in an inquiry because the witnesses who could give such evidence
are intimidated and would not come forward and the only evidence which would be P
a g e 41 | 103 available, namely, in this case, of policemen, police officers and senior
officers, would only be peripheral and cannot relate to all the charges and that,
therefore, leading only such evidence may be assailed in a court of law as being a
mere farce of an inquiry and a deliberate attempt to keep back material witnesses, the
disciplinary authority would be justified in coming to the conclusion that an inquiry
is not reasonably practicable. The affidavit filed by the Joint Director, Research and
Analysis Wing, Cabinet Secretariat, Hari NarianKak, who had passed the impugned
orders, sets out in detail the various acts of intimidation, violence and incitement
committed by each of the appellants. Copies of the written reasons for dispensing
with the inquiry in the case of the appellants have also been annexed to the said
affidavit. It is clear from a perusal of the said affidavit and its annexures that the
police officers, policemen and senior officers could not have possibly given evidence
with respect to all these acts. The said affidavit further states that the senior officers
were also intimated and were threatened with dire consequences if they gave
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 33
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
evidence. Further, grievances were made against the senior officers of the RAW in the
said charter of demands submitted by the said Association and the evidence of senior
officers would have been attacked as being biased and partisan. There is thus no
substance in this point also."
23. In Kuldip Singh v. State of Punjab, this Court held:
(SCC pp 662-63, para 7) "7. At our direction made on 22-4-1996 in this matter, the
learned counsel for the State has produced the original record relating to the
appellant's dismissal along with translated copies of the relevant document placed
before us by the learned counsel for the State is the copy of FIR No. 219 of 1990 dated
24-11-1990. It is based upon the statement of Head Constable Hardev Singh, who was
posted as gunman with Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of Police (SP)
(Operations). The FIR speaks of the jeep (in which the said SP was travelling along
with certain police personnel) being blown up killing the said SP and few other police
officials. The next document placed before us is the case diary pertaining to the said
crime containing the statement of the appellant, Kuldip Singh. In his statement,
Kuldip Singh P a g e 42 | 103 did clearly state about his association with certain
named militants, the plot laid by them to kill Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of
Police, Tarn Taran by placing a bomb and the manner in which they carried out the
said plot. He also stated that he and his militant companions planned to plant a
bomb in the office of SSP, Tarn Taran but that the police officers came to know of the
said plan, thus foiling their plan. The learned counsel for the State of Punjab did
concede that except the aforesaid statement of admission/confession of the appellant,
there was no other material on which the appellant could be held guilty of conduct
warranting dismissal from service.
24. This Court in Union of India v. R. Reddappa held as under: (SCC p. 274, para 5) "5. More than a
decade has gone by since these employees were dismissed for participating in strike called by the
Union recognised by the Railways.
.................................................................. ..................................................................
.................................................................. ........................................................ We are not impressed
by the vehement submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the CAT, Hyderabad
exceeded its jurisdiction in recording the finding that there was no material in support of the finding
that it was not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry. The jurisdiction to exercise the power
under Rule 14(ii) was dependent on existence of this primary fact. If there was no material on which
any reasonable person could have come to the conclusion as is envisaged in the Rule then the action
was vitiated due to erroneous assumption of jurisdictional fact therefore the Tribunal was well
within its jurisdiction to set aside the orders on this ground. An illegal order passed by the
disciplinary authority does not assume the character of legality only because it has been affirmed in
appeal or revision unless the higher authority is found to have applied its mind to the basic
infirmities in the order. Mere reiteration or repetition instead of adding strength to the order
renders it weaker and more vulnerable P a g e 43 | 103 as even the higher authority constituted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 34
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
under the Act or the rules for proper appraisal shall be deemed to have failed in discharge of its
statutory obligation.
25. In Indian Railway Construction Co. Ltd. V. Ajay Kumar, this Court held: (SCC p. 588, para 12)
"12. It is fairly well settled that the power to dismiss an employee by dispensing with an enquiry is
not to be exercised so as to circumvent the prescribed rules. The satisfaction as to whether the facts
exist to justify dispensing with enquiry has to be of the disciplinary authority. Where two views are
possible as to whether holding of an enquiry would have been proper or not, it would not be within
the domain of the court to substitute its view for that of the disciplinary authority as if the court is
sitting as an appellate authority over the disciplinary authority. The contemporaneous
circumstances can be duly taken note of in arriving at a decision whether to dispense with an
enquiry or not. What the High Court was required to do was to see whether there was any scope for
judicial review of the disciplinary authority's order dispensing with the enquiry. The focus was
required to be on the impracticability or otherwise of holding the enquiry.
26. The law laid down by this Court being clear and explicit, the question which would arise for our
consideration is whether in then prevailing situation, what a reasonable man taking a reasonable
view would have done."
[28] The learned Deputy Advocate General, further, submitted that the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that while examining an order issued for dismissing a person by invoking clause (c) to second
proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution, the Court cannot look into the sufficiency or
correctness of materials are also about the relevancy as long as some materials are found relevant
which forms the subjective P a g e 44 | 103 satisfaction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of
India &Anr. v. Balbir Singh &Ors. [(1998) 5 SCC 216] (Para No. 7), observed that -
"7. In the case of A.K. Kaul v. Union of India this Court has examined the extent of
Judicial review permissible in respect of an order of dismissal passed under second
proviso clause (c) of Article 311(2) of the Constitution. This Court has held that the
satisfaction of the President can be examined within the limits laid down in S.R.
Bomai v. Union of India. The order of the President can be examined to ascertain
whether it is vitiated either by mala fides or is based on wholly extraneous and / or
irrelevant grounds. The court, however, cannot sit in appeal over the order, or
substitute its own satisfaction for the satisfaction of the President. So long as there is
material before the President which is relevant for arriving at his satisfaction as to the
Court would be bound by the order so passed. This Court has enumerated the scope
of judicial review of the President's satisfaction for passing an order under clause (c)
of the second proviso to Article 311(2). The Court has said, (1) that the order would be
open to challenge on the ground of mala fides or being based wholly on extraneous
and/o irrelevant grounds; (2) even if some of the material on which the action is
taken is found to be irrelevant the court would still not interfere so long as there is
some relevant material sustaining the action; (3) the truth or correctness of the
material cannot be questioned by the court nor will it go into the adequacy of the
material and it will also not substitute its opinion for that of the President; (4) the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 35
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
ground of mala fides takes in, inter alia, situations where the proclamation is found
to be a clear case of abuse of power, (5) the could will not lightly presume abuse or
misuse of power and will make allowance for the fact that the president and the
Council of Ministers are the best judge of the situation and that they are also in
possession of information and material and the Constitution has trusted their
judgment in the matter; (6) this does not mean that the President and the Council of
Ministers are the final arbiters in the matter o that their opinion is conclusive; (cf.
also Union of Territory, Chandigarh v. Mohinder Singh)."
P a g e 45 | 103 In A.K. Kaul & Anr. v. Union of India &Anr.
[(1995) 4 SCC 73](Para No. 21),the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that -
"21. It would thus appear that in S.R. Bommai though all the learned Judges have
held that the exercise of power under Article 356 (1) is subject to judicial review but
in the matter of justiciability of the satisfaction of the President, the view of the
majority (Pandian, Ahmadi, Verma, Agrawal, Yogeshwar Dayal and Jeevan Reddy,
JJ) is that the principles evolved in Barium Chemicals for adjudging the validity of an
action based on the subjective satisfaction of the authority created by statute do not,
in their entirety, apply to the exercise of a constitutional power under Article 356. On
the basis of the judgment of Jeevan Reddy, J., which takes a narrower view than that
taken by Sawant, J., it can be said that the view of the majority (Pandian, Kuldip
Singh, Sawant, Agrawal and Jeevan Reddy, JJ.) is that:
(i) the satisfaction of the President while making a proclamation under Article 356(1)
is justiciable;
(ii) it would be open to challenge on the ground of mala fides or being based wholly
on extraneous and / or irrelevant grounds;
(iii) even if some of the materials on which the action is taken is found to be
irrelevant, the court would still not interfere so long as there is some relevant
material sustaining the action;
(iv) the truth or correctness of the material cannot be questioned by the court nor will
it go into the adequacy of the material and it will also not substitute its opinion for
that of the President;
(v) the ground of mala fides takes in inter alia situations where the Proclamation is
found to be a clear case of abuse of power or what is sometimes called fraud on
power;
(vi) the court will not lightly presume abuse or misuse of power and will make
allowance for the fact that the President can the Union Council of Ministers are the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 36
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
best judge of the situation and that they are also in possession of information and
material and that the Constitution has trusted their judgment in the matter; and P a g
e 46 | 103
(vii) this does not mean that the President and the Council of Ministers are the final
arbiters in the matter or that their opinion is conclusive."
But, in both, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the scope of judicial review of the President's
satisfaction for passing an order under (c) of the second proviso to Article 311(2) in following terms:
"(1) that the order would be open to challenge on the ground of mala fides or being
based wholly on extraneous and/o irrelevant grounds;
(2) even if some of the material on which the action is taken is found to be irrelevant
the court would still not interfere so long as there is some relevant material
sustaining the action;
(3) the truth or correctness of the material cannot be questioned by the court nor will
it go into the adequacy of the material and it will also not substitute its opinion for
that of the President;
(4) the ground of mala fides takes in, inter alia, situations where the proclamation is
found to be a clear case of abuse of power;
(5) the court will not lightly presume abuse or misuse of power and will make
allowance for the fact that the president and the Council of Ministers are the best
judge of the situation and that they are also in possession of information and material
and the Constitution has trusted their judgment in the matter;
(6) this does not mean that the President and the Council of Ministers are the final
arbiters in the matter o that their opinion is conclusive; (cf. also Union of Territory,
Chandigarh v. Mohinder Singh)."
Accordingly, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the view that the present
case comes under the purview of the above 6 (six) terms.
P a g e 47 | 103 [29] As observed earlier by us, the materials placed before the authority are not
relevant/reliable enough for the conclusion that there is no expediency to conduct inquiry. [30] It is
true that as per the Hon'ble Supreme Court's observation (supra), the Court cannot look into the
sufficiency or correctness of materials which are also about the relevancy as long as some materials
are found relevant which forms the subjective satisfaction. However, it is also observed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court that it can be examined to ascertain whether it is vitiated either by malafide
or is based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds and also that it would be open to
challenge on the ground of malafide or being based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[31] On going through the confidential file placed before us, the only ground put up by the reporting
authority as reproduced above are only allegations which were found emerged during criminal
investigation of the FIR case. On further perusal of the confidential file as well as facts asserted by
the parties, the appellant failed to specifically mention about the conducts and activities of the writ
petitioner/respondent for dismissal from service by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of
India on the ground that due to the prejudicial activities of the writ petitioner were affecting
sovereignty and security of the State.
P a g e 48 | 103 [32] In the present case, the authority registered FIR against the writ
petitioner/respondent, put under suspension, Departmental inquiry was conducted and the writ
petitioner submitted written argument. Mention is made here that the time consumed from the
registration of FIR till the issuance of the dismissal order was almost two and half years. In the
midst of this period of two and half years, the authority failed to mention/report of the further
commission of prejudicial activities causing the interest of the security of the State; but without any
specific reason (fresh prejudicial activities) other than the of the offences alleged in the above
mentioned report. In this factual position, we are not inclined to agree with the submission made
above by the learned counsel for the writ appellant that in the interest of the security of the State, it
is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of involvement and association with subversive
activities of the writ petitioner.
[33] Further, on perusal of the dismissal order dated 13.07.2017 issued in the name of Governor at
para No. 1 which reads as follows:
"Whereas, the Governor of Manipur is satisfied under sub-clause(c) of the proviso to
clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution that in that interest of the security of the
State it is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of involvement and association
with subversive activities of Shri L. Sushil Singh, Sub-Inspector (CID/SB), Manipur."
P a g e 49 | 103 [34] In this order itself, it is mentioned that "in the interest of the security of the
State it is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of involvement and association with
subversive activities". In the light of our observation made above, this order itself is contrary to the
steps taken as mentioned above by the authority because, the SP (CID/SB), Manipur, Imphal issued
an office memorandum dated 22.02.2016 for conducting departmental inquiry against the writ
petitioner/respondent and calling upon the writ petitioner/respondent to submit written statement
of his defence. It is evident without any doubt that the departmental inquiry was started way back in
the month of February, 2016.But, the dismissal of the writ petitioner from service by invoking
Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India was issued only on 13.07.2017. The said office
memorandum is extracted herein below:

In the instant case, it is to be mentioned that suspension order was issued on
24.01.2015 and the memorandum dated 22.02.2016 was issued on 22.02.2016 for

service by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India was issued on
13.07.2017.
On considering these facts, we are not inclined to agree with the grounds made in the
dismissal order dated 13.07.2017.
[35] The office memorandum dated 11.11.1985 issued by Director, Government of
India/Bharat Sarkar, Ministry of Personnel and Training, Administrative Reforms
and Public Grievances and Pension (Department of Personnel and Training, New
Delhi) which was issued in compliance to the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order passed
in Civil Appeal No. 6814 of 1983, Civil Appeal No. 3484 of 1982 delivered on
11.07.1985 regarding the scope of second proviso to Article 311(2) of the Constitution
of India (Tulsiram Patel & Ors.) and in the subsequent judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court delivered on 12.09.1985 in the case of Satyavir Singh & Ors. (Civil
Appeal No. 242 of 1982 and Civil Appeal No. 576 of 1982) makes it imperative to
clarify the issue for the benefit and guidance for all concerned. The relevant para of
the office memorandum is reproduced herein below:
P a g e 52 | 103 "6. Coming to clause (b) of the second proviso to Art.
311(2), there are two conditions precedent which must be satisfied before action under this clause is
taken against a government servant. These conditions are:-
(i) There must exist a situation which makes the holding of an inquiry contemplated
by Art. 311(2) not reasonably practicable. What is required is that holding of inquiry
is not practicable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a reasonable view of the
prevailing situation. It is not possible to enumerate all the cases in which it would not
be reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry. Illustrative cases would be -
(a) Where a civil servant, through or together with his associates, terrorises,
threatens or intimidates witnesses who are likely to give evidence against him with
fear of reprisal in order to prevent them from doing so; or
(b) Where the civil servant by himself or with or through others threatens,
intimidates and terrorises the officer who is the disciplinary authority or members of
his family so that the officer is afraid to hold the inquiry or direct it to be held; or
(c) Where an atmosphere of violence or of general indiscipline and insubordination
prevails at the time the attempt to hold the inquiry is made.
The disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary inquiry lightly or
arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of an inquiry or because
the Department's case against the civil servant is weak and is, therefore, bound to fail.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 40
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Another important condition precedent to the application of clause (b) of the second proviso to Art.
311(2), or Rule 19(ii) of the CCS (CC & A) Rules, 1965 or any other similar rule is that the
disciplinary authority should record in writing the reason or reasons for its satisfaction that it was
not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry contemplated by Art. 311(2) or corresponding
provisions in the service rules. This is a constitutional obligation and if the reasons are not recorded
in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and the order of penalty following it would both be
void and unconstitutional.
It should also be kept in mind that the recording in writing of the reasons for dispensing with the
inquiry must precede an P a g e 53 | 103 order imposing the penalty. Legally speaking, the reasons
for dispensing with the inquiry need not find a place in the final order itself, though they should be
recorded separately in the relevant file. In spite of this legal position, it would be of advantage to
incorporate briefly the reasons which led the disciplinary authority to the conclusion that it was not
reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry, in the order or penalty. While the reasons so given may be
brief, they should not be vague or they should not be just a repetition of the language of the relevant
rules."
At para No. 2 of the office memorandum, it was mentioned that -
"............................ no Government employee can be dismissed, removed, reduced in
rank without an inquiry in which he has been informed of the charges against him
and given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself except in the three exceptional
situations listed in clause (a), (b) and
(c) of the second proviso of Article 311(2) of the Constitution that the requirement of
holding inquiry may be dispensed with."
At para No. 3 of the memorandum, it was mentioned that -
"................. the competent authority is expected to exercise its power under this
proviso after due caution and considerable application of mind....................."
At para No. 6 of the memorandum, it was mentioned that -
"6. Coming to clause (b) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2), there are two conditions

P a g e 55 | 103 At para No. 9 of the office memorandum, it was mentioned that -
"9. As regards action under clause (c) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2) of the
Constitution, what is required under this clause is the satisfaction of the President or
the Governor, as the case may be, that in the interest of the security of the State, it is
not expedient to hold an inquiry as contemplated by Art. 311(2). This satisfaction is of
the President or the Governor as a constitutional authority arrived at with the aid and
advice of his Council of Ministers. The satisfaction so reached by the President or the
Governor is necessarily a subjective satisfaction. The reasons for this satisfaction
need not be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank, nor can
it be made public. There is no provision for departmental appeal or other
departmental remedy against the satisfaction reached by the President or the
Governor. If, however, the inquiry has been dispensed with by the President or the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 42
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Governor and the order of penalty has been passed by disciplinary authority revision
will lie. In such an appeal or revision, the civil servant can ask for an inquiry to be
held into his alleged conduct, unless at the time of the hearing of the appeal or
revision a situation envisaged by the second proviso to Article 311(2) is prevailing.
Even in such a situation, the hearing of the appeal or revision application should be
postponed for a reasonable length of time for the situation to become normal.
Ordinarily the satisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, would not be a
matter for judicial review. However, if it is alleged that the satisfaction of the
President or Governor, as the case may be, had been reached mala fide, or was based
on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds, the matter will become subject to judicial
review because, in such a case, there would be no satisfaction, in law, of the President
or the Governor at all. The question whether the court may compel the Government
to disclose the materials to examine whether the satisfaction was arrived at mala fide,
or based on extraneous or irrelevant grounds, would depend upon the nature of the
documents in question i.e. whether they fall within the class of privileged documents
or whether in respect of them privilege has been properly claimed or not."
[36] Considering the facts and observations made above by us, we are of the view that the conditions
made herein in both para No. 6 and 9 of the office memorandum are not complied P a g e 56 | 103
with/fulfilled by the authority in invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India in dismissing
the service of the writ petitioner/respondent. Further, in the facts and circumstances as set out by
the authority in the present case, the authority failed to convince this Court that during the said
more than two years of the pendency of the case/inquiry, the petitioner did not give cooperation to
the investigation or there were additional activities committed by the petitioner apart from the
activities mentioned in the original report.
[37] Further, we are of the view that the report of the disciplinary authority as well as the decision of
the Committee of Advisors and approval given by the Hon'ble Chief Minister as well as the Hon'ble
Governor are not in conformity with the guidelines set out in the present office memorandum as
well as the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court for contemplating recourse to take
decision that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry contemplated by Article 311(2) or
corresponding provisions in the service rule. The satisfaction of the Hon'ble Governor as found in
the notes of the confidential file is "may be approved". Even the words satisfied is not used; in this
situation, we are of the view that the satisfaction of the Hon'ble Governor had been reached malafide
based on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds; hence open to judicial review.
P a g e 57 | 103 [38] It has further been submitted that the pendency of criminal
proceeding/Departmental proceeding is different aspect and it does not debar the State in taking
action under Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India. As such, there is no infirmity in the order
dated 13.07.2017 dismissing the writ petitioner/respondent from service in the interest of the
security of the State by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India. Further, in Union of
India & Ors. V. Major SP Sharma & Ors. [(2014) 6 SCC 351] (Para No. 69), the Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 43
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
"69. Indisputably, defence personnel fall under the category where the President has
absolute pleasure to discontinue the services. Further, in our considered opinion as
far as security is concerned, the safeguard available to civil servants under Article 311
is not available to defence personnel as judicial review is very limited. In cases where
continuance of army officers in service is not practicable for security issue then such
officers can be removed under the pleasure of doctrine. As a matter of fact, Section 18
of the Army Act is in consonance with the constitutional powers conferred on the
President empowering the President to terminate the services on the basis of material
brought to his notice. In such cases, the army officers are not entitled to claim an
opportunity of hearing. In our considered opinion the pleasure doctrine can be
invoked by the President at any stage of enquiry on being satisfied that continuance
of any officer is not in the interest of and security of the State. It is therefore not a
camouflage as urged by the respondents."
[39] The registration of FIR against the writ petitioner was made on 22.01.2015 and the writ
petitioner was placed under suspension on 24.01.2015 and after lapse of more than 1 (one) year of
the registration of FIR, the memorandum dated 22.02.2016 was issued both for initiating
Departmental inquiry, vide orders P a g e 58 | 103 dated22.02.2016 and 27.02.2016. The inquiry
officer and presenting officer were appointed respectively. Written statement of defence was
submitted by the writ petitioner on 03.03.2016 and the supplementary written statement of defence
was submitted on 12.09.2016 and in compliance with the inquiry officer, the writ petitioner
appeared before the inquiry officer on 19.09.2016 and 19.11.2016, submitted written arguments to
the inquiry authority on 05.12.2016 and the order dated 13.07.2017 was issued by invoking Article
311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India dismissing the writ petitioner from service.
[40] Further, the learned Deputy Advocate General submitted that under the Rules of Business of
the Government of Manipur framed in exercise of power conferred by clause (2) and (3) of Article
166 of the Constitution, the proposals for awarding punishment of dismissal or removal or
compulsory retirement from service invoking the proviso (c) to Article 311(2) of the Constitution has
to be submitted by the Chief Minister to the Governor before the issue of the Order, Rule 55(xx). As
such, the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors was placed before the Hon'ble Chief
Minister for referring to the Governor of Manipur.
[41] As observed above, the contents and materials placed before the Committee of Advisors,
Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Governor are not enough to come to conclusion that the P a g e
59 | 103 case of the writ petitioner is fit to resort to Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India for
dismissing the service of the writ petitioner. [42] The learned Deputy Advocate General referred to
the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in P. Balakotaiah V. Union of India & Ors. (AIR
1958 SC 232) wherein it has been observed that -
"12(iii) It is next contended by the Mr. Umrigar that the charges which were made
against the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1956 in the notice dated 6-7-1950,
have reference to events which took place prior to the coming into force of the
Security Rules, which was on 14-5-1949, and that the order terminating the services

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
of the appellant based thereon is bad as giving retrospective operation to the rules,
and that the same is not warranted by the terms thereof. Now, the rules provide that
action can be taken under terms, if the employee is engaged in subversive activities.
Where an authority has to form an opinion that an employee is likely to be engaged in
subversive activities, it can only be as a matter of interference from the course of
conduct of the employee, and his antecedents must furnish the best materials for the
same. The rules are clearly prospective in that action thereunder is to be taken in
respect of subversive activities which either now exist or are likely to be indulged in,
in future, that is to say, which are in esse or in posse. That the materials for taking
action in the latter case are drawn from the conduct of the employees prior to the
enactment of the rules does not render their operation retrospective. Vide the
observations of the Lord Denman, C.J., in The Queen V. St. Mary Whitechapel and
The Queen V. Chirstchurch. This contention must also be rejected."
[43] As observed above, the allegation made against the writ petitioner contained in the confidential
file and secret report i.e. from the registration of FIR till the issuance of the dismissal order as
narrated above, the disciplinary authority's recommendation for dismissal of the writ petitioner
from service by resorting to Article P a g e 60 | 103 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, the
disciplinary authority is not able to show that there is no expediency to conduct departmental
inquiry against the writ petitioner. [44] It has also been submitted by the learned Dy. Advocate
General that the dismissal of a Government employee by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of Constitution
of India on the recommendation of Committee of Advisors constituted under the office
memorandum dated 26.07.1980 of the Central Government in consonance with the office
memorandum dated 16.08.2008 of the State Government were subject matter in several cases
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and no decision is found invalidating these office memorandum.
In other words, the office memorandum is upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
The submission made above by the learned Dy. Advocate General is contrary to the laws laid down
in the office memorandum.
[45] Mr. K. Roshan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that vide order dated
24.01.2015, he was placed under suspension and after the lapse of one year, memorandum dated
22.02.2016 was issued for initiating departmental inquiry. Vide orders dated 22.02.2016 and
27.02.2016, the inquiry officer and presenting officer were appointed respectively.
P a g e 61 | 103 His written statement of defence was submitted on 03.03.2016 and the
supplementary written statement of defence was also submitted on 12.09.2016. He appeared before
the presenting officer, pursuant to and in compliance with the signal dated 19.09.2016 and
19.11.2016, he submitted his written arguments to the inquiry authority on 05.12.2016. Thereafter,
the departmental inquiry came to a standstill and the representation dated 04.05.2017 was
submitted seeking for reinstatement on the ground that more than 2 (two) years have passed since
the initiation of the departmental inquiry and nothing material has come up except for some bare
allegations. However, surprisingly the order dated 13.07.2017 was issued by invoking Article 311(2)
second proviso, clause (c) of the Constitution of India. [46] The learned counsel appearing for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 45
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
respondent, further, submitted that since the departmental inquiry had already been held and
completed with active participation and full co- operation of the respondent, the provisions of the
Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India cannot be made applicable in the case of the
respondent. As per Article 311(2)(b)(c) of the Constitution of India, inference can be drawn that the
decision to dispense with the enquiry has to precede the actual departmental inquiry.
P a g e 62 | 103 It has also been submitted that in the year 1985, the Departmental of Personnel &
Training, Government of India issued an Office Memorandum No. 11012/11/86-Estt(A), dated
11.11.1985 to clarify the issues regarding the scope of second proviso to Article 311(2) of the
Constitution of India subsequent to and in consequence of the case of Tulsiram Patel &Ors. The
relevant Para No. 6 of the office memorandum is extracted herein below:
"6. Coming to clause (b) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2), there are two conditions
precedent which must be satisfied before action under this clause is taken against a
government servant. These conditions are :-
(a) There must exist a situation which makes the holding of an inquiry contemplated
by Art. 311(2) not reasonably practicable. What is required is that holding of inquiry
is not practicable in the opinion of a reasonable man taking a reasonable view of the
prevailing situation. It is not possible to enumerate all the cases in which it would not
be reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry. Illustrative cases would be -
(b) Where a civil servant, through or together with his associates, terrorises,
threatens or intimidates witnesses who are likely to give evidence against him with
fear of reprisal in order to prevent them from doing so; or
(c) Where the civil servant by himself or with or through others threatens,
intimidates and terrorises the officer who is the disciplinary authority or members of
his family so that the officer is afraid to hold the inquiry or direct it to be held; or
(d) Where an atmosphere of violence or of general indiscipline and insubordination
prevails at the time the attempt to hold the inquiry is made.
The disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary inquiry lightly or
arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding of an inquiry or because
the Department's case against the civil servant is weak and is, therefore, bound to fail.
Another important condition precedent to the application of clause (b) of the second proviso to Art.
311(2), or Rule 19(ii) of the CCS (CC & A) Rules, 1965 or any other similar rule is that P a g e 63 | 103
the disciplinary authority should record in writing the reason or reasons for its satisfaction that it
was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry contemplated by Art. 311(2) or corresponding
provisions in the service rules. This is a constitutional obligation and if the reasons are not recorded
in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and the order of penalty following it would both be
void and unconstitutional.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 46
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
It should also be kept in mind that the recording in writing of the reasons for dispensing with the
inquiry must precede an order imposing the penalty. Legally speaking, the reasons for dispensing
with the inquiry need not find a place in the final order itself, though they should be recorded
separately in the relevant file. In spite of this legal position, it would be of advantage to incorporate
briefly the reasons which led the disciplinary authority to the conclusion that it was not reasonably
practicable to hold an inquiry, in the order or penalty. While the reasons so given may be brief, they
should not be vague or they should not be just a repetition of the language of the relevant rules."
Para No. 9 of the office memorandum aforementioned (cited by both parties) is also extracted
below:
"9. As regards action under clause (c) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2) of the
Constitution, what is required under this clause is the satisfaction of the President or
the Governor, as the case may be, that in the interest of the security of the State, it is

or whether in respect of them privilege has been properly claimed or not."
[47] The respondent had participated in the departmental inquiry which was proceeded against him
with his active participation and full co-operation to the disciplinary authorities and had never
committed any illegal acts as enumerated in the Para No. 6 of the said office memorandum which
would prevent the disciplinary authorities from proceeding with the departmental inquiry. The
authorities before dispensing with the inquiry by invoking Article 311(2)(b)(c) have not followed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 47
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
stipulations as laid down in the said Para No. 6 of the office memorandum illegally and arbitrarily.
[48] In response to the counter affidavit filed by the appellants/State, it has been submitted by the
learned counsel appearing for the respondent that the proposal of the Home Department,
Government of Manipur, for dismissal of the respondent under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution
of India for involvement in subversive activities and his association with the P a g e 65 | 103
unlawful organization despite being a member of a disciplined police force in the interest of security
of the State, placed before the Committee of Advisors, which recommended the proposal for
dismissal of the respondent, is mere allegation. During the writ proceeding, the Hon'ble Single
Judge did not have the opportunity to peruse the records placed before the Committee of Advisors,
but nevertheless in Para No. 18 of the judgment under appeal had stated that the allegations which
were levelled against the respondent requires thorough inquiry by way of oral and documental
proof. Para No. 18 of the judgment is extracted below:
"18. No material has been placed before this Court qua the satisfaction stated in the
impugned dismissal order. Nothing on record before the Court to show that the
petitioner is closely associated with the Commander of Auxiliary Battalion of
PLA/RPF viz., Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha and also he had provided secret and vital
official information to the said Ahingcha. The alleged expert report stated in the
counter has not been placed before this Court. Moreover, the allegations levelled
against the petitioner requires thorough inquiry by way of oral and documental
proof."
But, in the present appeal, as directed by us, the State appellants produced the confidential file
before us and perused the contents of the confidential file.
In addition to the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgments relied by us, we are also relying on the
following Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment in deciding the present case.
P a g e 66 | 103 In the case of Union of India V. MM Sharma [(2011) 11 SCC 293 [Para No. 18], the
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that-
"18. It should also be pointed out at this stage that sub-
clause (b) of the second proviso to Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India
mandates that in case the disciplinary authority feels and decides that it is not
reasonably practical to hold an inquiry against the delinquent officer the reasons for
such satisfaction must be recorded in writing before an action is taken. Sub-clause (c)
of the second proviso to Article 311(2) on the other hand does not specifically
prescribe for recording of such reasons for the satisfaction but at the same time, there
must be records to indicate that there are sufficient and cogent reasons for
dispensing with the enquiry in the interest of the security of the State. Unless and
until such satisfaction, based on reasonable and cogent grounds is recorded it would
not be possible for the court or the Tribunal. Where such legality of an order is

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
challenged, to ascertain as to whether such an order passed in the interest of the
security of the State is based on reasons and is not arbitrary. If and when such an
order is challenged in the court of law the competent authority would have to satisfy
the court that the competent authority has sufficient materials on record to dispense
with the inquiry in the interest of security of the State."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court held in the case of Southern Railway Officers' Association & Anr. V.
Union of India &Ors. [(2009) 9 SCC 24 (para No. 19)] that -
"19. The second proviso appended to Article 311, however, makes three exceptions in
regard to constitutional requirement to hold an inquiry, clause (b) whereof provides
that in a case where the disciplinary authority is satisfied that it is not reasonably
practicable to hold such inquiry, subject of course to the condition that reasons
therefor are to be recorded in writing. Recording of reasons, thus, provides adequate
protection and safeguard to the employee concerned. It is now well settled that
reasons so recorded must be cogent and sufficient. Satisfaction to be arrived at by the
disciplinary authority for the aforementioned purpose cannot be arbitrary. It must be
based on objectivity."
P a g e 67 | 103 [49] In the case of Dr. V.R. Sanal Kumar V. Union of India &Ors. [2023 Livelaw (SC)
432, Para No. 24], the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that -
"24. We have already taken note of the indisputable and undisputed facts obtained in
this case which are relevant for the purpose of consideration of the question with
respect to the expediency or inexpediency of holding an inquiry "in the interest of the
security of the State." In view of the situations deducible from the materials on
record, we find absolutely no reason to hold that the satisfaction that it is not
expedient to hold an inquiry "in the interest of security of the State" was arrived at
without any material. When once it is obvious that circumstances to hold an inquiry
"in the interest of the security of the State" to hold an inquiry warrants no further
scrutiny, rather, it is not fit to be subjected to further judicial review. In other words,
the Court cannot, in such circumstances, judge on the expediency or inexpediency to
dispense with the inquiry as it was arrived at based on the subjective satisfaction of
the President based on materials. In the above circumstances, we do not find any
reason to interfere with the disinclination on the part of the Tribunal and then the
High Court, on the aforesaid issue."
[50] Based on the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent submitted that the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors for dismissal of the
respondent from service cannot be said to be cogent and sufficient based on objectivity. The
Committee of Advisors acted on mere allegations and recommended for dispensing with the
departmental inquiry against the respondent and the same suffers from the arbitrariness and it is
illegal.

P a g e 68 | 103 For the sake of convenience, the meaning of cogent, sufficient, satisfaction, objective
and subjective as these words are properly and conveniently used in the provision of Article
311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, as interpreted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court are reproduced
herein below:
COGENT MEANING The term "cogent" means something that is clear, logical, and
convincing. When an argument, explanation, or piece of evidence is described as
cogent, it means it is well- reasoned and persuasive, making it compelling and easy to
understand. For example, a cogent argument in a debate would be one that is both
rational and effectively supported by evidence.
COGENT MEANING IN LEGAL TERMS In legal terms, "cogent" refers to evidence or
arguments that are compelling, clear, and logically sound. When evidence is
described as cogent, it means that it is strong, relevant, and effectively supports a
particular point or claim in a legal case. Similarly, a cogent argument in a legal
context would be one that is well-structured, persuasive, and based on sound
reasoning and credible evidence. In essence, cogent evidence or arguments are
crucial for persuading a judge or jury and for making a strong case in legal
proceedings.
SUFFICIANT MEANING The term "sufficient generally means adequate or enough to
meet a particular need or requirement. In different contexts, it can have specific
meanings:
SUFFICIENT IN LEGAL TERMS In legal terms, "sufficient" generally pertains to
meeting the necessary criteria or standards required for a legal purpose. Here are a
few specific contexts:
1. Sufficient Evidence: This means that the evidence presented is adequate to support
a legal claim or defence.
P a g e 69 | 103
2. Sufficient Grounds: This refers to having enough legal basis or justification for
taking a particular legal action or making a legal claim. For instance, a plaintiff must
have sufficient grounds to file a lawsuit, meaning there are valid reasons supported
by facts and law.
SATISFACTION IN LEGAL TERMS In legal terms, "satisfaction" refers to the fulfilment or
discharge of a legal obligation, judgment, or claim. Here are some specific contexts where
"satisfaction" is used:
In essence, satisfaction in legal terms means that an obligation, whether financial,
contractual, or otherwise, has been fully met or resolved.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
OBJECTIVE MEANING Objectivity refers to the quality of being unbiased, impartial,
and based on observable facts rather than personal feelings, opinions, or
interpretations. It involves assessing or presenting information in a way that is
neutral and free from personal bias.
OBJECTIVITY MEANING IN LEGAL TERMS In legal terms, objectivity refers to the
principle of assessing facts, evidence, and legal arguments in an impartial and
unbiased manner. It means making decisions or evaluations based on factual
evidence and legal standards, rather than personal beliefs, emotions or interest.
SUBJECTIVE MEANING The term "subjective" refers to perspectives, experiences,
or interpretations that are influenced by personal feelings, opinions, and biases
rather than objective facts. In other words, something subjective is shaped by
individual viewpoints and can vary from person to person. SUBJECTIVE MEANING
IN LEGAL TERMS
1. Impartiality: Judges, juries, and legal professionals must approach cases and
evidence without favoritism or prejudice. This means ensuring that personal opinions
do not influence legal decisions or interpretations.
2. Fact-based Analysis: Legal decisions should be based on objective facts and
evidence presented in the case. This includes evaluating witness testimonies,
documents, and other relevant information without letting subjective perceptions
affect the outcome.
P a g e 70 | 103
3. Fair Application of Law: The law must be applied consistently and fairly to all
parties involved, without bias.
Objectivity ensures that legal rules and principles are applied in a manner that upholds justice and
equality.
4. Avoidance of Bias: Legal professionals, including judges and attorneys, are expected to avoid
conflicts of interest and maintain neutrality to ensure a fair trial or legal process.
Overall, objectivity in the legal field is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the judicial process
and ensuring that justice is administered fairly and based on clear, unbiased evidence and legal
reasoning. We agree to the submission made above by the learned counsel appearing for the
respondent with regard to the actions taken by the Committee of Advisors to the materials on which
basis the decision was made and subsequent approval of the Governor to the recommendation for
dismissing the writ petitioner from service cannot be said to be cogent and sufficient basing on the
objectivity of the satisfaction of the authority and subjective satisfaction of the Governor.

[51] On hearing the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents and on
perusal of the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgments relied upon by the learned counsel, we are of the
view that there is force and merit in the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents and such submissions are reasonable and reliable in the facts and circumstances of the
case and the observation made in the relied judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court are all
applicable and supported the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents.
P a g e 71 | 103 [52] The Governor could not have arrived at the subjective satisfaction that it was not
expedient to hold inquiry as contemplated under Article 311(2) second proviso clause (c) of the
Constitution of India on the basis of the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors which was
based purely on allegations, as such the decision to dispense with departmental inquiry and
satisfaction of the Governor is open to judicial review, as the satisfaction arrived at is vitiated by
malafide and is based wholly on extraneous and irrelevant grounds.
[53] The learned counsel appearing for the respondent also preferred the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court passed In Samsher Singh V. State of Punjab [1974 (2) SCC 831] (Para No. 31& 57)
which reads as follows:
"31. Further the Rules of Business and allocation of business among the Ministers are
relatable to the provisions contained in Article 53 in the case of the President and
Article 154 in the case of the Governor, that the executive power shall be exercised by
the President or the Governor directly or through the officers subordinate. The
provisions contained in Article 74 in the case of the President and Article 163 in the
case of the Governor that there shall be a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the
President or the Governor, as the case may be, are sources of the Rules of Business.
These provisions are for the discharge of the executive powers and functions of the
Government in the name of the President or the Governor. Where functions
entrusted to a Minister are performed by an official employed in the Minister's
department there is in law no delegation because constitutionally the act or the
decision of the official is that of the Minister. The official is merely the machinery for
the discharge of the functions entrusted to a Minister (see Halsbury's Laws of
England 4th Ed.
P a g e 72 | 103 Vol. I, Paragraph 747 to p. 170 and Carltona Ltd. V. Works
Commissioners).
57. For the foregoing reasons we hold that the President or the Governor acts on the
aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head in the
case of the Union and the Chief Minister at the head in the case of State in all matters
which vests in the Executive whether those functions are executive or legislative in
character. Neither the President nor the Governor is to exercise the executive
functions personally."

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Further, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in PU Myllai Hlychho & Ors. V. State of Mizoram &Ors.
[(2005) 2 SCC 92] (Para No. 14& 15) has observed that -
"14. Our Constitution envisages the parliamentary or cabinet system of government
of the British model both for the Union and the States. Under the cabinet system of
government as embodied in our Constitution, the Governor is the constitutional or
formal head of the State and he exercises all his power and functions conferred on
him by or under the Constitution on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers
save in spheres where the Governor is required by or under the Constitution to
exercise his functions in his discretion.
15. The executive power also partakes the legislative or certain judicial actions.
Wherever the Constitution requires the satisfaction of the Governor for the exercise
of any power or function, the satisfaction required by the Constitution is not personal
satisfaction of the Governor but the satisfaction in the constitutional sense under the
cabinet system or government. The Governor exercises functions conferred on him by
or under the Constitution with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and he
is competent to make rules for convenient transaction of the business of the
Government of the State, by allocation of business among the Ministers, under
Article 166(3) of the Constitution."
P a g e 73 | 103 [54] The learned counsel appearing for the respondent referred to the decision of
Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Jaswant Singh V. State of Punjab & Ors. [(1991) 1 SCC 362] (Para
No. 5) which reads as under:
"5. The impugned order of April, 7, 1981 itself contains the reasons for dispensing with the inquiry
contemplated by Article 311(2) of the Constitution, Paragraph 3 of the said order, which we have
extracted earlier, gives two reasons in support of the satisfaction that it was not reasonably
practicable to hold a departmental enquiry against the appellant. These are (i) the appellant has
thrown threats that he with the help of other police employees will not allow holding of any
departmental enquiry against him and (ii) he and his associates will not hesitate to cause physical
injury to the witnesses as well as the enquiry officer. Now, as stated earlier after the two revision
applications were allowed on October, 13, 1980, the appellant had re-joined service as Head
Constable on March 5, 1981 but he was immediately placed under suspension. Thereafter, two show
cause notices dated April, 4, 1981 were issued against him calling upon him to reply thereto within
10 days after the receipt thereof. Before the service of these notices the incident of alleged attempt to
commit suicide took place on the morning of April, 6, 1981 at about 11.00 a.m. In that incident the
appellant sustained an injury on his right arm with a knife. He was, therefore, hospitalised and while
he was in hospital the two show cause notices were served on him at about 10.00 p.m. on April, 6,
1981. Before the appellant could reply to the said show cause notices respondent No. 3 passed the
impugned order on the very next day i.e. April, 7, 1981. Now, the earlier departmental inquiries were
duly conducted against the appellant and there is no allegation that the department had found any
difficulty in examining witnesses in the said inquiries. After the revision applications were allowed
the show cause notices were issued and 10 days time was given to the appellant to put in his replies
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 53
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
thereto. We, therefore, enquired from the learned counsel for the respondents to point out what
impelled respondent 3 to take a decision that it was necessary to forthwith terminate the services of
the appellant without holding an inquiry as required by Article 311(2). The learned counsel for the
respondents could only point out clause (iv)(a) of sub-para 29(A) of the counter which reads as
under:
P a g e 74 | 103 "The order dated April 7, 1981 was passed as the petitioner's activities
were objectionable. He was instigating his fellow police officials to cause indiscipline,
show insubordination and exhibit disloyalty, spreading discontentment and hatred,
etc. and his retention in service was adjudged harmful."
This is no more than a mere reproduction of paragraph 3 of the impugned order. Our
attention was not drawn to any material existing on the date of impugned order in
support of the allegation contained in paragraph 3 thereof that the appellant had
thrown threats that he and his companions will not allow holding of any
departmental enquiry against him and that they would not hesitate to cause physical
injury to the witnesses as well as the enquiry officer if any such attempt was made. It
was incumbent on the respondents to disclose to the court the material in existence at
the date of the passing of the impugned order in support of the subjective satisfaction
recorded by respondent 3 in the impugned order. Clause (b) of the second proviso to
Article 311(2) can be invoked only when the authority is satisfied from the material
placed before him that it is not reasonably practicable to hold a departmental
enquiry. This is clear from the following observation at page 270 of Tulsiram case
(SCC p. 504, para 130).
"A disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary inquiry
lightly or arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the holding
of an inquiry or because the department's case against the government servant is
weak and must fail."
The decision to dispense with the departmental enquiry cannot, therefore, be rested solely on the
ipse dixit of the concerned authority. When the satisfaction of the concerned authority is questioned
in a court of law, it is incumbent on those who support the order to show that the satisfaction is
based on certain objective facts and is not the outcome of the whim or caprice of the concerned
officer. In the counter filed by respondent 3 it is contended that the appellant, instead of replying to
the show cause notice, instigated his fellow police officials to disobey the superiors. It is also said
that he threw threats to beat up the witnesses and the Inquiry Officer if any departmental inquiry
was held against him. No particulars are given. Besides it is difficult to understand how he could
have given threats, etc. P a g e 75 | 103 when he was in hospital. It is not show on what material
respondent 3 came to the conclusion that the appellant had thrown threats as alleged in paragraph 3
of the impugned order. On a close scrutiny of the impugned order it seems the satisfaction was
based on the ground that he was instigating his colleagues and was holding meetings with other
police officials with a view to spreading hatred and dissatisfaction towards his superiors. This
allegation is based on his alleged activities at Jullundur on April 3, 1981 reported by SHO/GRP,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 54
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Jullundur. That report is not forthcoming. It is no one's contention that the said SHO was
threatened. Respondent 3's counter also does not reveal if he had verified the correctness of the
information. To put it tersely the subjective satisfaction recorded in paragraph 3 of the impugned
order is not fortified by any independent material to justify the dispensing with of the inquiry
envisaged by Article 311(2) of the Constitution. We are, therefore, of the opinion that on this short
ground alone the impugned order cannot be sustained."
[55] On the basis of the report, the Committee of Advisors recommended dismissal of the writ
petitioner/respondent saying that it is not expedient to hold departmental inquiry in the interest of
the security of the State as their prejudicial activities are affecting the security of the State. Before
passing the above recommendation, the Committee of Advisors in the meeting held on 24.04.2017
observed and the reference is made to reproduce minutes of the meeting of Committee of Advisors
at Para No. 17.
In the confidential file, the material placed before the Committee as well as before the Hon'ble Chief
Minister and Hon'ble Governor, there is no document indicating the activities of the respondent; but
only the above mentioned facts.
P a g e 76 | 103 [56] In the facts and circumstances and as narrated above, we are of the view that
the satisfaction of the Governor has been reached malafide, basing on wholly irrelevant and
unreliable materials and extraneous or irrelevant grounds as such, the present dismissal order by
invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution become subject to judicial review. The official record
placed before us, as per this Court's direction, did not disclose any materials to support that the
subjective satisfaction of the Governor was arrived at validly and reasonably.
[57] From the registration of the FIR till the dismissal of the writ petitioner/respondent which took
about two and half years, the authority, in all the documents placed before us, failed to mention and
establish the continuity of the petitioner's involvement with unlawful organisation and engagement
in the subversive activities which would have otherwise satisfied the authority to take
steps/recommend that the writ petitioner/respondent to be dismissed from service under Article
311(2)(c) of the Constitution as it is not expedient to hold departmental inquiry in the interest of
security of the State as the prejudicial activities are affecting the security of the State.
[58] Mention is made here again that this decision was taken after the lapse of two and half years
and the inquiry was initiated and concluded after filing the written argument from the P a g e 77 |
103 part of the writ petitioner/respondent meaning that departmental inquiry had then reached its
final stage and abrupt volte-face of the disciplinary authority with apparent no new development in
between.
[59] We have already expressed our opinion and already given our observation that the disciplinary
authority failed to convince us that the invocation of Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India in
dismissing the writ petitioner from service are without malafide but, in our opinion, the step was
taken malafidely.

The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[60] The learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that basing on the proposition of
laws laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the cases aforementioned and various other
judgments rendered in this regard, it is very clear that the recommendation of the Committee of
Advisors is not binding on the Governor and the Governor in exercise of his constitutional power
cannot give approval to the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors constituted pursuant to
the office memorandum dated 16.08.2008, in a routine manner/fashion. [61] After hearing both the
learned counsels and also after perusal of the pleadings with the citations submitted by both parties
in support of their case, we have put forth three questions to consider in the present case. They are -
P a g e 78 | 103
(i) Whether the satisfaction to be arrived at by the Governor is subjective satisfaction?
Yes, the satisfaction to be arrived at the Governor is subjective but, the opinion of the inquiry
authority should be objective basing on the materials placed before them and the satisfaction
arrived at by the Governor should be on the basis of relevant materials placed before it.
(ii) Whether the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the Governor can be subject to judicial review?
Yes, if the satisfaction arrived by the Governor is shown malafide and basing on the irrelevant
materials placed before it, it is subject to judicial review.
(iii) If there can be judicial review, what are the grounds which can be subjected to judicial review?
(a) On the ground of malafide or being based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant ground.
(b) If the material, on which the action is taken, is found to be irrelevant.
(c) If the decision was made on malafide or extraneous consideration in arriving such decision that
subjective to judicial review. As regards the issue No. (i), after going through the pleadings of the
parties, the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as reproduced above and the
observation herein above by us, we are of the opinion that satisfaction to be arrived at by the
Governor in this regard, should be a subjective satisfaction.
P a g e 79 | 103 Our view, in this regard, is well explained at Para No. 9 of the office memorandum
which reads as follows:
"9. As regards action under clause (c) of the second proviso to Art. 311(2) of the
Constitution, what is required under this clause is the satisfaction of the President or
the Governor, as the case may be, that in the interest of the security of the State, it is
not expedient to hold an inquiry as contemplated by Art. 311(2). This satisfaction is of
the President or the Governor as a constitutional authority arrived at with the aid and
advice of his Council of Ministers. The satisfaction so reached by the President or the
Governor is necessarily a subjective satisfaction. The reasons for this satisfaction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 56
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
need not be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in rank, nor can
it be made public. There is no provision for departmental appeal or other
departmental remedy against the satisfaction reached by the President or the
Governor. If, however, the inquiry has been dispensed with by the President or the
Governor and the order of penalty has been passed by disciplinary authority revision
will lie. In such an appeal or revision, the civil servant can ask for an inquiry to be
held into his alleged conduct, unless at the time of the hearing of the appeal or
revision a situation envisaged by the second proviso to Article 311(2) is prevailing.
Even in such a situation, the hearing of the appeal or revision application should be
postponed for a reasonable length of time for the situation to become normal.
Ordinarily the satisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, would not be a
matter for judicial review. However, if it is alleged that the satisfaction of the
President or Governor, as the case may be, had been reached mala fide, or was based
on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds, the matter will become subject to judicial
review because, in such a case, there would be no satisfaction, in law, of the President
or the Governor at all. The question whether the court may compel the Government
to disclose the materials to examine whether the satisfaction was arrived at mala fide,
or based on extraneous or irrelevant grounds, would depend upon the nature of the
documents in question i.e. whether they fall within the class of privileged documents
or whether in respect of them privilege has been properly claimed or not."
P a g e 80 | 103 As regards the issues No. (ii) & (iii), we are of the considered view that the
satisfaction arrived at by the Governor can be subject to judicial review, if the subjective satisfaction
for invoking Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India, is arrived at:
(a) On the ground of malafide or being based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant
ground.
(b) If the material, on which the action is taken, is found to be irrelevant.
(c) If the decision was made on malafide or extraneous consideration in arriving such
decision that subjective to judicial review.
[62] The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed in Union of India V. Tulsiram Patel [(1985) 3 SCC 938] at
Para No. 130, 133 & 134 that -
"130. ................ It is because the disciplinary authority is the best judge of this that
clause (3) of Article 311 makes the decision of the disciplinary authority on this
question final. A disciplinary authority is not expected to dispense with a disciplinary
inquiry lightly or arbitrarily or out of ulterior motives or merely in order to avoid the
holding of an inquiry or because the Department's case against the government
servant is weak and must fail. The finality given to the decision of the disciplinary
authority by Article 311(3) is not binding upon the court so far as its power of judicial
review is concerned and in such a case the court will strike down the order dispensing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 57
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
with the inquiry as also the order imposing penalty.
133. The second condition necessary for the valid application of clause (b) of the
second proviso is that the disciplinary authority should record in writing its reason
for its satisfaction that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry
contemplated by Article 311(2). This is a constitutional obligation and if such reason
is not recorded in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and the order of
penalty following thereupon would both be void and unconstitutional.
P a g e 81 | 103
134. It is obvious that the recording in writing of the reason for dispensing with the
inquiry must precede the order imposing the penalty. The reason for dispensing with
the inquiry need not, therefore, find a place in the final order. It would be usual to
record the reason separately and then consider the question of the penalty to be
imposed and pass the order imposing the penalty. It would, however, be better to
record the reason in the final order in order to avoid the allegation that the reason
was not recorded in writing before passing the final order but was subsequently
fabricated. The reason for dispensing with the inquiry need not contain detailed
particulars, but the reason must not be vague or just a repetition of the language of
clause (b) of the second proviso. For instance, it would be no compliance with the
requirement of clause (b) for the disciplinary authority simply to state that he was
satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable to hold any inquiry."
[63] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India & Anr. V. M.M. Sharma [(2011) 11 SCC 239]
observed at Para No. 18 that-
"18. It should also be pointed out at this stage that sub- clause (b) of the second
proviso to Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India mandates that in case the
disciplinary authority feels and decides that it is not reasonably practical to hold an
inquiry against the delinquent officer the reasons for such satisfaction must be
recorded in writing before an action is taken Sub-clause (c) of the second proviso to
Article 311(2) on the other hand does not specifically prescribe for recording of such
reasons for the satisfaction but at the same time there must be records to indicate
that there are sufficient and cogent reasons for dispensing with the enquiry in the
interest of the security of the Stat e. Unless and until such satisfaction, based on
reasonable and cogent grounds is recorded it would not be possible for the court or
the Tribunal, where such legality of an order is challenged, to ascertain as to whether
such an order passed in the interest of the security of the State is based on reasons
and is not arbitrary. If and when such an order is challenged in the Court of law the
competent authority would have to satisfy the court that the competent authority has
sufficient materials on record to dispense with the enquiry in the interest of security
of the State."

P a g e 82 | 103 [64] The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dr. V.R. Sanal Kumar v. Union of India &Ors.
[2023 LiveLaw (SC) 432] observed at Para No. 23 that -
"23. Paragraph 126 of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Tulsiram Patel's case
(supra) would reveal that the Constitution Bench, while considering a provision
parimateria to Rule 16(iii) of the CCA Rules viz., Rule 14 of the Railway Servants
Rules, found error inasmuch as the issue was considered by confining to Rule 14
itself, without taking into account the second proviso of Article 311 (2) of the
Constitution of India. After observing that exercise of power is always referable to the
source of power and must be considered in conjunction with it and held that the
source of power to dispense with an inquiry, in such circumstances, is derived from
the second proviso to Article 311(2). Bearing in mind the said observation and
holding we have carefully considered the order passed by the Administrative Tribunal
which was subjected to further judicial review by the High Court. We have no
hesitation to hold that a bare perusal of the order of the Tribunal would reveal that
the tribunal had considered the question not confining its consideration only to Rule
16(iii) of CCA Rules but also taking into consideration the source of power derived
from the second proviso to Article 311(ii) of the Constitution of India. Obviously, the
question whether it is expedient to hold an inquiry as provided under the CCA Rules
has to be considered and the satisfaction as to its expediency or inexpediency has to
be reached based on "interest of the security of the State". The meaning and scope of
the expression 'security of the State' has been considered by the Constitution Bench
in Tulsiram Patel's case (supra). It was observed that the expressions "Law and
Order", "Public Order" and "security of the State"
have been used in different Acts. Situations which affect "Public Order" are graver than those which
affect "law and order" and situations which affect "security of the State" are graver than those which
affect "Public Order". It was therefore, observed and held that of all these situations those which
affect "security of the State" are the gravest. The expression "security of the State" does not mean
security of the entire country or a whole State and it includes security of the part of the State.
Furthermore, it was held that there are various ways in which "security of the State" could be
affected such as, by State secrets or information relating to defence production or similar matters
being passed on to other countries, whether inimical or not to our country, or by secret links with
terrorists. It was also held that it would be difficult to enumerate the various ways in which the
"security of the State" could be affected and the way in which "security P a g e 83 | 103 of the State"
would be affected might be either open or clandestine. In Paragraph 142 of Tulsiram Patel's case
(supra) it was further held:
"142. The question under clause (c), however, is not whether the security of the State
has been affected or not, for the expression used in clause (c) "in the interest of the
security of the State." The interest of the security of the State may be affected by
actual acts or even the likelihood of such acts taking place. Further, what is required
under clause (c) is not the satisfaction of the President or the Governor, as the case
may be, that the interest of the security of the State is or will be affected but his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 59
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
satisfaction that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold
an inquiry as contemplated by Article 311(2). The Satisfaction of the President or the
Governor must, therefore, be with respect to the expediency or inexpediency of
holding an inquiry in the interest of the security of the State."
[65] As discussed above, the steps taken by the appellant/State Government to remove the
respondent from his service was under Article 311(2)(c) and on perusal of the same, it is crystal clear
that the President or the Governor as the case may be, if satisfied in the interest of the security of the
State, is the constitutional authority to decide that it is not expedient to hold such inquiry. However,
this step can be taken when the Governor is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the report
submitted by the Committee of Advisors. The decision of the Governor should be in a concrete
manner.
[66] The issue involved in this case was whether the disciplinary authority was justified in imposing
penalty on delinquent employee without holding any inquiry as provided in Article 311(2) second
proviso (b) of the Constitution of India.
P a g e 84 | 103 [67] The disciplinary authority passed an order for dismissal of the petitioner from
service under Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as it was not expedient to hold
departmental inquiry holding that the delinquent employee's prejudicial activities were affecting the
sovereignty and integrity and security of the State.
[68] Some of the principles to be followed by the authority in exercise of power under Article
311(2)(c);
(i) It is well settled that the reason so recorded must be causing sufficient satisfaction to be arrived
at by the disciplinary authority for the aforementioned purpose cannot be arbitrary it must be based
on objectivity.
(ii) The Court is required to consider what a reasonable man taking a reasonable view would have
done in the situation then prevailing.
(iii) In order of disciplinary authority in a case of this nature must be judged by a Court exercising
power of judicial review by placing itself in the disciplinary authority's arm chair.
(iv) The disciplinary authority should record in writing its reason for its satisfaction that it was not
reasonably practical to hold the inquiry contemplated by Article 311(2) this is a constitutional
obligation and if such reason is not recorded in writing, the order dispensing with the inquiry and
order or penalty following thereupon would both be void and unconstitutional.
P a g e 85 | 103
(v) The power to dismiss an employee by dispensing with an inquiry if not to be exercised so as to
circumvent the prescribed rules.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 60
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
(vi) It is an established principle of law that an inquiry under Article 311(2) of the Constitution of
India is a rule and dispensing with the inquiry is an exception.
[69] As per our direction, the State authority produced the original/confidential file and placed
before us and we already made observation about the contents of the confidential file.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case Southern Railways Association and Anr. V. Union of India
&Ors.(2009)9 SCC 24 at Para No. 23 observed that -
"23. In Kuldip Singh v. State of Punjab this Court held:
(SCC pp. 662-63, para 7) "7. At our direction made on 22-4-1996 in this matter, the
learned counsel for the State has produced the original record relating to the
appellant's dismissal along with translated copies of the relevant documents. The first
document placed before us by the learned counsel for the State is the copy of FIR No.
219 of 1990 dated 24-11-1990. It is based upon the statement of Head Constable
Hardev Singh, who was posted as gunman with Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of
Police, (SP) (Operations).
The FIR speaks of the jeep (in which the said SP was travelling along with certain police personnel)
being blown up killing the said SP and few other police officials. The next document placed before us
is the case diary pertaining to the said crime containing the statement of the appellant, Kuldip
Singh. In his statement, Kuldip Singh did clearly state about his association with certain named
militants, the plot laid by them to kill Shri Harjit Singh, Superintendent of Police, Tarn Taran by
placing a bomb and the manner in which they carried out the said plot. He also stated that he and P
a g e 86 | 103 his militant companions planned to plant a bomb in the office of SSP, Tarn Taran but
that the police officers came to know of the said plan, thus foiling their plan. The learned counsel for
the State of Punjab did concede that except the aforesaid statement of admission/confession of the
appellant, there was no other material on which the appellant could be held guilty of conduct
warranting dismissal from service."
[70] Some of the admitted positions of facts:
(i) The respondent joined service in the year 2007.
(ii) The respondent was suspended from service while posted as Sub-Inspector of
Police (CID) on 24.01.2015 and FIR case was registered being FIR No. 21(1)2015 U/S
38(1) UA(P) Act Section 5 (b) of the Official Secret Act. But, charge sheet is not yet
filed. After lapse of one year, memorandum dated 22.02.2016 was issued for
initiating departmental inquiry vide orders dated 22.02.2016 and 27.02.2016, the
inquiry officer and presenting officer were appointed respectively.
(iii) Written statement of defence was submitted on 03.03.2016 and the
supplementary written statement of defence was also submitted on 12.09.2016. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 61
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
delinquent also appeared before the presenting officer pursuant to an in compliance
with signals dated 19.09.2016 and 19.11.2016. Thereafter, the delinquent submitted
his written argument to the inquiry authority on 05.12.2016.
(iv) The respondent was departmentally proceeded by issuing Article of charge dated 22.02.2016
was issued by SP(CID).
P a g e 87 | 103
(v) As the departmental inquiry was not moving further, the delinquent while representation dated
04.05.2017 seeking for reinstatement on the ground that two years have passed since initiation of
departmental inquiry.
(vi) The State Government issued an order dated 13.07.2017 by invoking Article 311 (2) second
proviso clause (c) of the Constitution of India.
(vii) The delinquent filed writ petition challenging the dismissal order before the Hon'ble Single
Judge and the Hon'ble Single Judge was pleased to allow the writ petition and directed the authority
to reinstate the respondent. The said direction is as follows:
"18. No material has been placed before this Court qua the satisfaction stated in the
impugned dismissal order. Nothing on record before the Court to show that the
petitioner is closely associated with the Commander of Auxiliary Battalion of
PLA/RPF viz., Sagolsem Bobby @ Ahingcha and also he had provided secret and vital
official information to the said Ahingcha. The alleged expert report stated in the
counter has not been placed before this Court. Moreover, the allegations levelled
against the petitioner requires thorough inquiry by way of oral and documental
proof."
(viii) Against the said order of the Hon'ble Single Judge, the State Government filed the present writ
appeal.
(ix) The dismissal order was issued after nearly two and half years and the said order was issued by
the State when already two parallel proceedings that is departmental and criminal prosecution are
pending.
P a g e 88 | 103 [71] In the present case, the authority resorted to roman No. (ii) & (iii) of the 3
(three) exceptions, but we have already expressed our opinion and observation that even though the
authority has taken the step, the step taken by the authority are against the provision of law laid
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in the Constitution as well as in the office memorandum.
We also expressed our opinion that the decision of the authority was taken malafide.
In this regard, we made reference to the Hon'ble Supreme Court's observation made in the case of
Tulsiram Patel & Ors.(supra).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 62
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[72] As regards the action under clause (c) of the second proviso to Article 311(2) of the
Constitution, what is required under this clause is the satisfaction of the President or the Governor,
as the case may be, that in the interest of the security of the State, it is not expedient to hold an
inquiry as contemplated by Article 311(2). This satisfaction is of the President or the Governor as a
constitutional authority arrived at with the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers. The
satisfaction so reached by the President or the Governor is necessarily a subjective satisfaction. The
reasons for this satisfaction need not be recorded in the order of dismissal, removal or reduction in
rank, nor can it be made public. There is no provision for departmental appeal or other
departmental remedy P a g e 89 | 103 against the satisfaction reached by the President or the
Governor. If, however, the inquiry has been dispensed with by the President or the Governor and the
order of penalty has been passed by disciplinary authority revision will lie. In such an appeal or
revision, the civil servant can ask for an inquiry to be held into his alleged conduct, unless at the
time of the hearing of the appeal or revision a situation envisaged by the second proviso to Article
311(2) is prevailing. Even in such a situation, the hearing of the appeal or revision application should
be postponed for a reasonable length of time for the situation to become normal. Ordinarily the
satisfaction reached by the President or the Governor, would not be a matter for judicial review.
However, if it is alleged that the satisfaction of the President or Governor, as the case may be, had
been reached mala fide, or was based on wholly extraneous or irrelevant grounds, the matter will
become subject to judicial review because, in such a case, there would be no satisfaction, in law, of
the President or the Governor at all. The question whether the Court may compel the Government to
disclose the materials to examine whether the satisfaction was arrived at mala fide, or based on
extraneous or irrelevant grounds, would depend upon the nature of the documents in question i.e.
whether they fall within the class of privileged documents or whether in respect of them privilege
has been properly claimed or not.
P a g e 90 | 103 [73] In Union of India vs. M.M. Sharma (2011) 11 SCC 293 at Para No. 18, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that sub- clause (c) of the second proviso to Article 311(2), on the
other hand, does not specifically prescribe for recording of such reasons for the satisfaction but at
the same time, there must be records to indicate that there are sufficient and cogent reasons for
dispensing with the enquiry in the interest of the security of the State. Unless and until such
satisfaction, based on reasonable and cogent grounds is recorded it would not be possible for the
court or the Tribunal. When legality of such an order is challenged, to ascertain as to whether such
an order passed in the interest of the security of the State is based on reasons and is not arbitrary. If
and when such an order is challenged in the court of law the competent authority would have to
satisfy the court that the competent authority has sufficient materials on record to dispense with the
inquiry in the interest of security of the State.
[74] Basing on the observation made above by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, we are of the considered
view that it is imperative for us to call the confidential file that was put up before the Hon'ble
Governor and the learned Deputy Advocate General put up the confidential file before us and on
perusal of the file, we did not find any cogent and reliable material to support the decision taken by
the authorities and we did not find any observation of the Hon'ble P a g e 91 | 103 Governor
regarding the satisfaction to invoke Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution against the respondent, but
only the words "may be approved".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 63
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
On further perusal of the entire record, we found nothing except the correspondence made between
the officials regarding the criminal case against the respondent. [75] In view of the situation
deducible from the materials on record, we find absolutely no reason to hold that the satisfaction, as
envisaged in the observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that it is not expedient to hold an
inquiry in the interest of security of the State, was arrived at, based on reasonable and cogent
ground. In the official record there is no material indicating that there are sufficient and cogent
reasons for dispensing with the inquiry in the interest of security of the State and in the absence of
clear indication of the satisfaction, we hold that the invoking of Article 311(2)(c) by the State
Government is malafide.
Accordingly, we find the act of the Hon'ble Governor in approving for invoking Article 311(2)(c) of
the Constitution of India is malafide and liable to be interfered with . [76] As per the office
memorandum No. 11012/11/86- ESTT(A), dated 11.11.1985as reproduced hereunder for invoking
Article 311(2)(c).
P a g e 9 2 | 1 0 3 T h e s a f e g u a r d s p r o v i d e d f o r h o l d i n g i n q u i r y
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
........................................................................................ The second safeguard provided for holding an
enquiry before dismissal or removal or reduction in rank and entitlement to audi alteram partem, is
not available under three situations, as provided under the clauses (a), (b) and (c) of second proviso
to sub-clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution as follows:
(a) Under clause (a) of the second proviso, a person can be dismissed or removed or
reduced in rank without holding any enquiry, on the ground of misconduct which has
led to his conviction on a criminal charge.
(b) The holding of enquiry also can be
dispensed with where the authority,
empowered to dismiss or remove a person
or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that, for some reasons, to be recorded by that
authority in writing, it is not reasonable to hold such an enquiry as provided under
clause.
(c) It will also not be required to hold an enquiry where the President or the
Governor, as the case may be, is satisfied that in the interest of security of the State, it
is not expedient to hold such an enquiry, under clause.
P a g e 93 | 103 Thus, though normally a person cannot be dismissed or removed from service or
reduced in rank except by holding a departmental enquiry and giving him reasonable opportunity of
being heard, as provided under clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution of India, yet holding of
enquiry can be dispensed with under three situations as mentioned above.
[77] Here, in the instant case, after going through the entire pleadings of the parties and the relevant
provision of law, the rules of business as exercised by the authority for invoking Article 311(2) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 64
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
Constitution of India against the respondent, we could not find the above mentioned three
illustrative cases which could be applied in the present case as it then stood. [78] In the office
memorandum mentioned above itself mentioned/stated that Para No. 9 stated that -
"......................................................................................
........................................................................................ Ordinarily the satisfaction
reached by the President or the Governor, would not be a matter for judicial review.
However, if it is alleged that the satisfaction of the President or Governor, as the case
may be, had been reached mala fide or was based on wholly extraneous or irrelevant
grounds, the matter will become subject to judicial review because, in such a case,
there would be no satisfaction, in law, of the President or the Governor at all. The
question whether the court may compel the Government to disclose the materials to
examine whether the satisfaction was arrived at mala fide or based on extraneous or
irrelevant grounds, would depend upon the nature of the documents in question i.e.
whether they fall within the class of privileged documents or whether in respect of
them privilege has been properly claimed or not."
P a g e 94 | 103 [79] It is now well settled that reasons so recorded must be cogent and sufficient.
Satisfaction to be arrived at by the disciplinary authority for the aforementioned purpose cannot be
arbitrary. It must be based on objectivity. For convenience and for satisfaction, we make reference
to the meanings of cogent, sufficient, satisfaction which are already reproduced at Para No. 50. [80]
THE SATISFACTION OF THE GOVERNOR IN THIS REGARD As per the submission of the learned
Deputy Advocate General, the satisfaction of the Governor as envisaged in Article 311(2) second
proviso, clause (c) of the Constitution is not the personal satisfaction of the Governor, but the
satisfaction to be arrived with the aid and advice of the council of Ministers. The learned Deputy
Advocate General referred to Para No. 48 of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Shamsher Singh's case (supra).In this regard, we have already observed at Para No. 12. [81] In this
regard, the learned Deputy Advocate General referred to Para No. 142 of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court's judgment passed in Tulsiram Patel's case (supra).
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that in the interest of the security of the State, the satisfaction
of the Governor therefore be with respect of the expediency or in-expediency of holding an inquiry
in the interest of the security of the State. The satisfaction so reached by the President or the
Governor must P a g e 95 | 103 necessarily be a subjective satisfaction. The satisfaction may be
arrived at as a result of secret information received by the Governor. [82] The learned Deputy
Advocate General also referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Union of
India & Ors. V. Major SP Sharma & Ors. [(2014) 6 SCC 351].
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that power is conferred on the President to terminate the
services on the material brought to his notice.
As observed earlier, in the instant case, the materials placed before the Hon'ble Governor was not
reliable enough to come to the satisfaction for revoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India
for dismissing the writ petitioner. [83] The learned Deputy Advocate General also referred to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 65
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Balbir's case (supra).
The Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that judicial review permissible in respect of an order of
dismissal passed under second proviso clause (c) of Article 311(2) of the Constitution, if it is to
ascertain whether the satisfaction arrived at by the President or Governor is vitiated either by
malafide or is based on wholly extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds. Further, it is observed that so
long as there is material before the President which is relevant for P a g e 96 | 103 arriving at his
satisfaction, the Court would be bound by the order so passed. This Court has enumerated the scope
of judicial review of the President's satisfaction for passing an order under clause (c) of the second
proviso to Article 311(2). The Court has said, (1) that the order would be open to challenge on the
ground of malafides or being based wholly on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds; (2) even if
some of the material on which the action is taken is found to be irrelevant the court would still not
interfere so long as there is some relevant material sustaining the action; (3) the truth or correctness
of the material cannot be questioned by the court nor will it go into the adequacy of the material and
it will also not substitute its opinion for that of the President; (4) the ground of mala fides takes in,
inter alia, situations where the proclamation is found to be a clear case of abuse of power, (5) the
Court will not lightly presume abuse or misuse of power and will make allowance for the fact that
the president and the Council of Ministers are the best judge of the situation and that they are also
in possession of information and material and the Constitution has trusted their judgment in the
matter; (6) this does not mean that the President and the Council of Ministers are the final arbiters
in the matter that their opinion is conclusive; (cf. also Union of Territory, Chandigarh v. Mohinder
Singh).
P a g e 97 | 103 In the instant case, as observed above by us, that the satisfaction of the Hon'ble
Governor was by malafide basing on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds put up/recommended by
the disciplinary authority and that the materials on which basis the disciplinary authority have taken
decision for recommendation by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India are wholly
unreliable materials.
[84] The learned Deputy Advocate General further referred to Para No. 6 of the office memorandum
which is extracted hereinabove.
In the office memorandum, the contemplation of Article 311(2) should be resolved to in the opinion
of a reasonable man taking a reasonable view of the prevailing situation and in the illustrative cases
would be -
(a) Where a civil servant, through or together with his associates, terrorises, threatens or intimidates
witnesses who are likely to give evidence against him with fear of reprisal in order to prevent them
from doing so; or
(b) Where the civil servant by himself or with or through others threatens, intimidates and terrorises
the officer who is the disciplinary authority or members of his family so that the officer is afraid to
hold the inquiry or direct it to be held; or P a g e 98 | 103
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 66
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
(c) Where an atmosphere of violence or of general indiscipline and insubordination prevails at the
time the attempt to hold the inquiry is made.
As discussed and observed earlier, we are of the view that in the instant case, the disciplinary
authority failed to fulfil the above mentioned three illustrative cases as the disciplinary authority
failed to exhibit to the fact that in the midst of the departmental inquiry:
(i) the writ petitioner has thrown threats that he with the help of other will not allow
holding of any departmental inquiry against him.
(ii) he and his associates will not hesitate the cause physical injury to the witnesses as
well as the inquiry officer.
[85] After perusal of the pleadings and cited jurisprudence extracted above, it is seen and evident
that the satisfaction as mentioned in the provision in arriving to the acceptance of the proposal
made by the Committee of Advisors to exercise for invoking clause (c) to second proviso to clause (2)
of Article 311 of the Constitution are subjective but, the materials placed before it to be relevant. If
the decision was made after the relevant materials placed before the Governor and the decision was
made with no malafide or extraneous consideration in arriving such decision, there will be no
judicial review to the decision arrived at. But, if the P a g e 99 | 103 satisfaction was made on
malafide or extraneous consideration in arriving such decision it can be subjected to judicial review.
[86] The satisfaction of the Governor must be with respect to expediency or in-expediency of
holding inquiry in the interest of the security of the State. As such, the satisfaction so reached by the
President or Governor must necessarily be a subjective satisfaction. Expediency involved matters of
policy and satisfaction may be arrived at, as a result of secret information received by the Governor
about the brewing danger to the security of the State. As observed earlier, the disciplinary authority
failed to make out their case and the materials on which basis they have taken their satisfaction for
revoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India was done with malafide intention.
Accordingly, their satisfaction to come to the conclusion was not objective. As such, it is observed
that the satisfaction, arrived at by the Hon'ble Governor on the basis of the secret information and
the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors was not subjective satisfaction as such, the
decision made therein was malafide.
[87] The order of the President/Governor can be examined to ascertain whether it is vitiated either
by malafide or it is based on wholly extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds and so long as there is
material before the President/Governor which is relevant for arriving P a g e 100 | 103 at his
satisfaction as to the Court would be bound by the order so passed.
In short, the order of the President or Governor would be open to challenge on the ground of
malafide or being based wholly on extraneous and irrelevant grounds. [88] Where an authority has
to form an opinion that an employee is likely to be engaged in subversive activities, it can only be
matter of interference from the course of conduct of the employee and his antecedents must form
the best material for the same.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83308932/ 67
The State Of Manipur Represented By The ... vs Shri Laishram Sushil Singh on 18 November, 2024
[89] Further, if the decision was arrived at based on the subjective satisfaction of the
President/Governor on materials, the question of judicial review does not arise. But, the decision
was taken without the subjective satisfaction of the President/Governor not basing on materials, the
interference of the Court may arise.
In short, the Governor could not have arrived at the subjective satisfaction that it was not expedient
to hold inquiry as contemplated under Article 311(2) second proviso clause (c) of the Constitution of
India on the basis of the recommendation of the Committee of Advisor which was based purely on
allegation as such, the decision to dispense with the departmental inquiry and satisfaction of the
Governor is open to judicial review. As the P a g e 101 | 103 satisfaction arrived at is vitiated by
malafide and is based wholly on extraneous and irrelevant grounds.
[90] The learned counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that basing on the proposition of
laws laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the cases aforementioned and various other
judgments rendered in this regard, it is very clear that the recommendation of the Committee of
Advisors is not binding on the Governor and the Governor in exercise of his constitutional power
cannot give approval to the recommendation of the Committee of Advisors constituted pursuant to
the office memorandum dated 16.08.2008.
[91] The disciplinary authority, in its order dated 13.07.2017, categorically stated that the Governor
of Manipur is satisfied under sub-clause (c) of proviso to clause (2) of Article 311 of the Constitution
that in the interest of security of State, it is not expedient to hold an inquiry in the case of
involvement and association with subversive activities of the delinquent and the Governor satisfied
with the information available, the activities of the delinquent are such to warrant his dismissal
from service, accordingly, dismissed the delinquent.
[92] After considering the facts and circumstances as narrated above and our view and observations
made above, we have come to the conclusion that the present appeal has got no P a g e 102 | 103
merit and no leg to stand on and we are not satisfied with the grounds taken by the appellant in view
of the admitted position of facts and law as set out above. Even though we agree with the conclusion
drawn by the Ld. Single Judge in setting aside the dismissal order dated 13.07.2017 dismissing the
writ petitioner by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India, we are not agreeable with
the grounds taken by the Ld. Single Judge for setting aside the dismissal order. Accordingly, we
dismiss the present appeal, however without any order as to cost.
The appellants are directed to implement the directions given by the Ld. Single Judge within a
period of 3 (three) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
