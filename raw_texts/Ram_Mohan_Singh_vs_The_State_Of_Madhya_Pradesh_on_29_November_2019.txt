JUDGMENT
(Jabalpur, dtd.29.11.2019) Per : Vijay Kumar Shukla, J.-
Regard being had to the similitude of prayers and considering the commonality of issues exposited
in these writ petitions, they were finally heard together. The principal issue raised is disposed of by
this singular order.
2. The petitioners in this batch of writ petitions having failed to qualify in the High School/Higher
Secondary Schools Teachers Eligibility Test, 2018 in the subjects of Economics, Mathematics,
Chemistry, Social Science and Sanskrit, have challenged the cancellation of question papers and
sought for a direction to the respondents, to apply the Rules called, Madhya Pradesh Rajya School
Shiksha Seva (Shaikshnik Samvarg) Seva Sharten Evam Bharti Niyam, 2018 [hereinafter referred to
as "the Rules 2018"] and to award marks for cancelled question and prepare a final list afresh. In
some petitions formula contained in Clause 2.9.A of the Examination Rules has also been
questioned.
3. The facts in all these petitions are almost same. In a nutshell, the petitioners appeared in the
Eligibility Test, 2018 held for different subjects. The Examination was conducted in three shifts in
some subjects. After declaration of the results the candidates raised grievances that some questions
were incorrect as per the answer key prepared by the respondent - Professional Examination Board
and some questions were out of syllabus. Therefore, the petitioners are entitled for award of
additional marks. It is also contended that the formula adopted by the Professional Examination
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106123238/ 4
Ram Mohan Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 November, 2019
Board is defective and arbitrary. The main arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioners are
crystallised in different petitions, subject-wise.
4. (i) The petitions relating to posts in the subject of Economics : W.P. No. 20290/2019, W.P.
No.20968/2019, W.P. No.23855/2019 and W.P. No.24021/2019. In W.P. No.20290/2019, it is
urged that the Professional Examination Board has cancelled 34 questions on the ground of out of
syllabus questions and translation mistakes. Out of 100 questions in the subject of Economics 29
questions were out out of syllabus, therefore, the petitioners could not attempt those questions and
be awarded full marks for not attempting the said questions. In other petitions it is urged that the
marks have not been awarded by adopting formula under clause 2.9 of the Rules and if the marks of
the petitioners are proportionately rationalised as per formula, they shall qualify the same.
Combating the aforesaid submissions, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the
formula in the examination Rules was published much prior to the said Examination and the
candidates were well aware of the scheme of the examination. The validity of formula has already
been examined by this Court and the Supreme Court. The marks reflected in the mark-sheets are
proportionate/rationalised marks after applying the formula.
(ii) The petitions pertaining to posts in the subjects of Mathematics and Social Science : W.P.
No.23559/2019, W.P. No.24292/2019, W.P. No.24294/2019, W.P. No.24503/2019, W.P.
No.24525/2019, W.P. No.24530/2019 and W.P. No.24673/2019. In these petitions the petitioners
have challenged the award of marks stating that the same has been awarded without following the
prescribed formula under the Rules 2018. Learned counsel for the Professional Examination Board
has submitted that the marks awarded to the petitioners were after applying the prescribed formula
in the Rules. Other similar points were also argued.
(iii) The petitions relating to the subject of Science : W.P. No.24526/2019 and W.P. No.24630/2019.
In these petitions the petitioners have questioned the formula contained in Clause 2.9 of the Rules
2018. Learned counsel for the Professional Examination Board stated that the formula has already
been examined by this Court and the Apex Court as well.
(iv) In W.P. No.24525/2019 and W.P. No.24902/2019, the reliefs claimed by the petitioners are
vague and not specific. However, the arguments advanced in these petitions are the same, which
have been canvassed in other cases.
5. In reply learned counsel appearing for the Professional Examination Board stated that there is no
defect in the process of normalisation. They have adopted a proper procedure and protocol with
regard to answer-key and after uploading the Model Answer- sheets, they have given 7 days time to
raise objections and after receiving the objections/submissions the expert body has examined the
same. He further argued that the validity of formula has already been upheld by a Division Bench of
this Court in the case of Vivek Jain vs. The Professional Examination Board, Madhya Pradesh,
Bhopal and others, AIR 1994 MP 164 and by the Supreme Court in the case of Vikas Pratap Singh
and others vs. State of Chhattisgarh and others, (2013) 14 SCC 494. He further urged that similar
petitions in respect of posts in the subjects of Economics, Mathematics, Social Science and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106123238/ 5
Ram Mohan Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 November, 2019
Chemistry have already been dismissed.
6. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and bestowed our anxious
consideration on the issues involved in the writ petitions.
7. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court has already dismissed similar writ petitions viz. W.P.
No.23296/2019 (Amit Nigam vs. State of M.P. and others; W.P. No.23669/2019 (Pushpraj Singh
Raghuvanshi vs. State of M.P. and others); W.P. No.20197/2019 (Arun Kumar Shukla vs. State of
M.P. and others); and W.P. No.22643/2019 (Dashrath Patel vs. State of M.P. and others) in respect
of the posts in the subjects of Economics, Social Science, Mathematics and Chemistry respectively,
after referring to Formula in clause 2.9.A of the Examination Rules. The relevant part of the order
passed in the case of Amit Nigam (supra) is reproduced :
"It is seen from record that clause 2.9 v of the examination Rules (filed as Annxure
P/6) empowers the examining body to cancel the questions in case of the
eventualities therein. The said clause stipulates:

Economics were found to be either out of course, mistake of translation (the
examination being in bilingual) and wrong options it was within the competence of
the Professional Examination Board to cancel the same and rationalize the total
marks as per example No.2 of Clause 2.9."

8. The validity of the formula has already been examined by the Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Vivek Jain (supra). Para 16 of the judgment being relevant is extracted hereunder :
"16. With respect to a cancelled question, the rule of the Board in 2.3, already quoted
in a preceding paragraph, is that candidates are given proportionate marks for that
question in relation to the marks earned by the candidate in that paper, irrespective
of whether that question was or was not attempted by him. The rationale behind this
course is quite discernible. It is deemed as if the cancelled question was not included
in the paper. For example, if 5 questions out of 100 questions in a paper, say of
Physics, are cancelled, it is deemed as if that paper consisted of only 95 questions.
Then, the marks obtained by the candidate in relation to 95 questions are only
considered. Supposing a candidate had scored 220 marks in relation to 95 questions,
his score is 220/95. This score is then converted into 100 questions. That score would
then come to Converted into round figure 220/95x100/1 = 231.57. Converted into
round figure it will be 232 marks. This score of 232 marks is proportionate marks in
relation to the marks earned by the candidate in the paper. The contention put
forward by learned counsel for the petitioners that even with respect to a cancelled
question a candidate should be awarded full marks for the marking done by him, is
unreasonable and cannot be accepted. Proportionate marks are properly awarded by
the Board with respect to such questions and with respect to question cancelled by
the Court, it is proper to direct award of proportionate marks as was also directed by
the Division Bench of this Court in Rekha Sanghi's case (supra).
9. Apart from that, the Apex Court has also examined the formula in the case of Vikas Pratap Singh
and others (supra) and in para 16 of the judgment ruled thus :
"16. It is not in dispute nor it can be disputed that for the purposes of re-evaluation,
the eight questions found incorrect were deleted and their marks were rightly allotted
on a pro-rata basis in accordance with Clause 14 of the Rules which reads as under:
"Clause 14. Wrong (Defective) objective type question, its cancellation and marks to
be allotted in lieu of it.
After the exams, the Chhattisgarh Professional Examination Board (VYAPAM) gets
each question examined by the subject expert. If, upon examination by the subject
experts, the questions are found defective/ wrong, it is rejected. Questions may be
rejected on the following reasons:
(i) if the structure of the question is wrong;
(ii) out of the options given as answers, if more than one options are correct.
(iii) If no option is correct.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/106123238/ 7
Ram Mohan Singh vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 29 November, 2019
(iv) If there is difference in Hindi and English translation of any question because of
which different meaning is drawn from both and one correct answer could not be
ascertained.
(v) If any other printing mistake is there because of which correct answer is not
ascertainable or more than one option is correct.
On such rejection of question upon the recommendation of Subject Expert Committee, on such
questions the marks would be awarded by the Chhattisgarh Professional Examination Board
(VYAPAM) to the candidates in proportion to their marks obtained in the particular question paper.
Whether the rejected question has been or not been attempted. The question papers in which the
questions have been rejected, their evaluation procedure would be as follows, if in any question
papers out of 100 questions two questions are rejected and after evaluation candidate secures 81
marks out of 98 questions then in such case calculation of marks would be done as (81x100)/100-2=
82.65. On which basis merit would be determined. "
The other eight questions whose answers were found incorrect in the earlier model
answers key were re-evaluated on the basis of revised model answers key. In Paper I,
only the objective type questions were re-evaluated with the aid of model answers key
prepared and provided to the examiners for the first time after the inquiry by the
respondent-Board."
10. In view of the aforesaid, since all the issues canvassed before us, have already been examined by
the Co-ordinate Bench and the Supreme Court as well, we do not perceive any merit in these writ
petitions. Accordingly, all the writ petitions are dismissed. However, in the facts and circumstances
of the case there shall be no order as to costs.
